{'article': 'The trailer for Pixar’s upcoming film Lightyear debuted last '
            'week, and met an unexpectedly muted response from film fans. It '
            'promises to be a fun, child-friendly animated space adventure '
            'with Chris Evans leading the voice cast, which should have '
            'delighted the faithful. But it centres on a character called Buzz '
            'Lightyear, derived from its Toy Story series, and appears to be '
            'yet another case of a film studio giving an unnecessary backstory '
            'to a character who arrived onscreen fully formed. For decades, '
            'fans and critics complained about Hollywood’s endless sequels, '
            'which eventually run out of steam by either ratcheting up the '
            'action to ludicrous heights or losing sight of what made their '
            'heroes interesting in the first place. Instead, to keep those '
            'same franchises alive, studios responded by pivoting to reboots, '
            'prequels and origin stories. These initially seemed more fruitful '
            '– a fun flashback origin opens Indiana Jones and the Last '
            'Crusade, with River Phoenix’s young Indy gaining all his '
            'character tics in a single eventful afternoon – but now we have '
            'an endless parade of such flashbacks masquerading as standalone '
            'films. Han Solo, Cruella de Vil, the wizard of The Wizard Of Oz, '
            'Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees: they’ve all had unnecessary '
            'origin stories. And all of their films share the same basic '
            'problem as the sequels: studio executives only seem to feel safe '
            'when they’re greenlighting films based on popular existing '
            'franchises, and that is self-defeating. The problem is not that '
            'Hollywood is out of ideas or original characters; we have a more '
            'diverse and daring crop of film-makers than at any time in film '
            'history. The issue is timid studios that prefer endless rehashes '
            'of the same characters because no one ever got fired for saying '
            'yes to a sequel or prequel. If your star gets too established and '
            'expensive, make an origin story and replace Johnny Depp with the '
            'younger, cheaper Timothée Chalamet, such as in the new Wonka '
            'film. If there’s a time when you can’t quite decide where to go '
            'with your Batman or Spider-Man series, write an origin story for '
            'their villains, and spin off Joker and Venom. Those two films '
            'also appealed to an older audience than the franchises that '
            'birthed them, but origin stories can go the other way too: the '
            'forthcoming Minions: The Rise of Gru takes a younger, cutesier '
            'approach to the protagonist of Despicable Me, presumably hoping '
            'that the latest crop of preschoolers will discover that '
            'franchise. And as with Joker and Venom, any notable villain is '
            'now fair game for their own origin-story prequel, taking a '
            'sympathetic view of their passage to the dark side: consider '
            'Maleficent, Cruella or the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy.\n'
            'The origin-story prequel has become a popular – with studios – '
            'way of reinvigorating dead or aged-out characters over and over. '
            'They’re not all bad, but the drama of prequels is inherently '
            'limited. We know that the hero of Solo: A Star Wars Story will '
            'survive his adventure; we also know he’ll make friends with a '
            'Wookiee and get a ship called the Millennium Falcon. But worse '
            'than that, none of this backstory adds much to his character. Han '
            'Solo arrived onscreen perfectly formed. We didn’t know what the '
            'Kessel run was; we just knew that the guy who did it in “less '
            'than 12 parsecs” was the coolest man alive. Learning that Darth '
            'Vader was once a sad little blond boy, or that Hannibal Lecter '
            'was scarred by the second world war only detracted from their '
            'effectiveness. It’s a rare prequel that adds useful context to an '
            'indelible character without stealing their mystique: The '
            'Godfather Part II is, if anything, the exception that proves the '
            'rule. The best we can hope for is a prequel with a clever twist: '
            '2009’s Star Trek film created a parallel timeline to the original '
            'TV series, allowing it to go off in a new direction without being '
            'locked into what had gone before. The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s '
            'overarching narrative has allowed that studio to launch new '
            'heroes and reboot elements of its story through time travel or '
            'multi-verse stuff without resorting to many outright origin '
            'stories or reboots – so far. At least Lightyear, technically, is '
            'not a prequel, even if it has all the hallmarks of one. It’s the '
            'story of the fictional character that inspired the Buzz Lightyear '
            'toy we know. This is the Toy Story universe’s equivalent of Buck '
            'Rogers or Flash Gordon, someone Buzz’s owner Andy would have '
            'watched on TV. That could offer some laughs and potentially a fun '
            'contrast to the studio’s all-conquering toys – but it’s still '
            'just another variation on a character we are familiar with, and '
            'catchphrases we’ve heard before. Pixar is far from the worst '
            'offender in this respect – Lightyear will follow recent original '
            'stories Luca, Soul and Onward – but this is essentially a fifth '
            'Toy Story feature, not counting short films, from a studio with '
            'greater potential for original storytelling than any other on '
            'Earth. Where are the great new characters and stories going to '
            'come from if we keep dipping into past triumphs for every film '
            'with a budget over $5m? If we only recycle the characters we '
            'already know we like, pop culture will finally eat itself. Helen '

{'article': 'The California condor is the largest flying bird in North '
            'America, with a 10ft wingspan that enables it to soar up to '
            '15,000ft – nearly half the height of a commercial airplane. Now '
            'the birds can claim another superlative feat: scientists have '
            'discovered that females can reproduce without a male partner, in '
            'a rare phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. Oliver Ryder, the '
            'director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife '
            'Alliance, has called the recent findings a “eureka moment”. “Many '
            'scientists have experiences like this when they see the world in '
            'a way they haven’t seen before,” says Ryder, who co-wrote a paper '
            'detailing the discovery, released in late October. “I was really '
            'pleased to figure out something that was such a conundrum.” '
            'Condors have been imperiled for a century. As Europeans settled '
            'the west, they often shot, poisoned and captured the condors, '
            'collected their eggs, and reduced their food supply of antelope, '
            'elk, and other large wild animals. Their population declined '
            'steadily until only 22 remained in 1982, but a state-led recovery '
            'program has since successfully bred the animals back from the '
            'brink.\n'
            'The journey that led to discovering the condor’s asexual '
            'reproduction also began in the 1980s, when the San Diego Zoo was '
            'tasked with developing a test to determine the sex of the few '
            'remaining wild condors, which were eventually all brought into '
            'the care of two captive breeding locations. Ryder says the zoo '
            'continued to use DNA testing to determine the familial '
            'relationships between the condors, to avoid inbreeding closely '
            'related individuals. More recently, scientists decided to '
            'undertake a complete genetic analysis of the population, which '
            'had grown to more than 900 birds. . They used condor samples '
            'collected over the course of the program’s 30-plus-year history, '
            'including blood, eggshell membrane, tissue from deceased birds, '
            'and feathers. When the scientists completed their investigation, '
            'there were two glaring cases that indicated something was amiss. '
            'Both involved chicks that came from an egg without genetic '
            'material from the male who shared the enclosure and was presumed '
            'to be the father. The results were confirmed by multiple samples, '
            'so scientists were confident it wasn’t a mistake. Ryder remembers '
            'the conversation with his colleague about the strange cases. He '
            'got goosebumps as he realized that the condors had reproduced '
            'through parthenogenesis – a form of reproduction in which an egg '
            'can develop into an embryo without being fertilized by a sperm. '
            'Parthenogenesis is derived from the Greek words for “virgin '
            'birth” and several insect species including aphids, bees, and '
            'ants are known to reproduce through the process, although the '
            'phenomenon is rare in birds.\n'
            'Ryder says it’s not yet known how unusual this kind of '
            'reproduction is in the natural world, because detailed genetic '
            'analysis of large populations hasn’t been conducted. “Think about '
            'it: the cases where we do know about it, it’s overwhelmingly '
            'where animals are managed in a way where females don’t have '
            'access to males. It was only because we had these detailed '
            'genetic profiles of the condor which were developed in response '
            'to the need for managing generic diversity that we discovered '
            'this.” The idea that these are “virgin births” is incorrect, he '
            'says: the females who reproduced this way had previously had many '
            'chicks through sexual reproduction. And birds don’t give birth; '
            'they lay eggs that hatch. Ryder thinks this phenomenon is '
            'probably going on in more species than people know. There are '
            'reports of snakes in the wild producing offspring through '
            'parthenogenesis. He says it’s a “rare but possibly impactful part '
            'of reproduction”. The condor is still considered a threatened '
            'species, and it remains unclear what solo reproduction will mean '
            'in terms of helping with conservation efforts. Condors can live '
            'into their 50s, but both of the male chicks born of asexual '
            'reproduction were relatively small and died before becoming '
            'sexually mature, at 1.9 and 7.9 years old.\n'
            'Ryder hopes to use the same genetic tools to peer into past '
            'populations – California condor specimens from the 1800s and '
            '1900s are commonplace in museums in the state and scientists '
            'could use them to assess how common parthenogenesis was in '
            'previous generations. He adds that the condor is a remarkable '
            'species that has survived from the Pleistocene era. Right now, '
            'the condor’s population growth is limited by poisoning from lead '
            'bullets, when the scavengers eat animals shot by hunters. “It’s '
            'been critically endangered and there’s a lot of public support '
            'for recovery,” Ryder says. Meanwhile, the bird,which has risen '
            'like the phoenix from near death, is rewriting scientific '
            'understanding. “This is really wondrous and amazing,” says Ryder: '
            'in the midst of an extinction crisis, scientists are still making '
            'big discoveries. “This is an unrecognized part of their natural '
            'history.”',

{'article': 'Last November, the WEAR-TV news station in northern Florida aired '
            'a segment on Dr Benjamin Marble, a local doctor who created a '
            'free telehealth website offering consultations for Covid-19. '
            'Marble, the reporter said, had made it so “patients don’t have to '
            'pay a cent” for coronavirus treatment and believed his site could '
            'replace Obamacare. To the average viewer, the segment on the ABC '
            'affiliate, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, was a local '
            'news report touting a local service. What the report didn’t '
            'mention, however, is that Marble is a member of America’s '
            'Frontline Doctors, a rightwing political group that gained '
            'notoriety in summer 2020 after some of its members appeared in a '
            'viral video touting unproven Covid-19 treatments as miracle '
            'cures.\n'
            'AFD’s founder, Dr Simone Gold, has headlined anti-vaccine rallies '
            'and is facing charges for storming the Capitol during the 6 '
            'January riot. Also visible in a photo included in the clip was Dr '
            'Stella Immanuel, an AFD member who has claimed masks don’t help '
            'curb the spread of Covid-19 and repeatedly said some real world '
            'illnesses were caused by people having sex in their dreams with '
            'demons and witches. Marble’s telehealth page itself links to '
            'anti-vaccine information and websites promoting unproven Covid-19 '
            'treatments such as the anti-parasite drug ivermectin. Since the '
            'start of the pandemic, local newspapers, broadcast television and '
            'radio stations across the United States have been among the most '
            'popular sources for information about Covid-19. Many anti-vaccine '
            'activists as well as doctors and groups promoting unproven '
            'Covid-19 treatments have turned to those same channels to spread '
            'their message. Prominent spreaders of medical disinformation, '
            'including Dr Joseph Mercola, who misinformation researchers have '
            'identified as one of the most prolific online promoters of '
            'anti-vaccine falsehoods, and members of the Children’s Defense '
            'Fund organization – anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr’s '
            'group – have appeared on local radio shows or published '
            'editorials in local newspapers promoting conspiracy theories '
            'about vaccine safety.\n'
            'Although local outlets lack the audience size of national '
            'broadcasters or newspapers, researchers say they can provide a '
            'veneer of legitimacy to fringe groups, amplifying their message. '
            'Americans have a greater degree of trust in Covid-19 information '
            'from local outlets compared with news media in general, a 2020 '
            'Pew Research Study found. And even a brief segment or article on '
            'local news can have a second life on social media platforms, '
            'where anti-vax groups and advocates of dubious Covid-19 '
            'treatments widely push their content. “You have somebody grab '
            'something off an obscure website that looks like a newspaper, '
            'post it on Facebook and pretty soon the Facebook algorithm takes '
            'over,” said Penny Abernathy, a professor at Northwestern '
            'University’s Medill School and author of several books on the '
            'news industry. Anti-vaxxers burrow into local media The US has a '
            'varied and vast local news landscape that includes broadcast '
            'stations, print and digital newspapers, each with their own '
            'vulnerabilities to spreading anti-vaccine narratives. Some local '
            'news outlets have spread Covid-19 misinformation out of what '
            'appears to be a lack of resources or expertise in covering health '
            'and science issues, researchers say. In the last 15 years, over '
            'half of the journalists working in local US media lost their jobs '
            'and more than one-fourth of American newspapers shut down. During '
            'the pandemic alone, more than 90 local newsrooms were forced to '
            'close down. That has meant many local outlets are operating with '
            'skeleton staff.\n'
            'The loss of newsrooms’ subject matter experts is especially '
            'notable in coverage of areas such as health and science, which '
            'require a high degree of scientific literacy and specific '
            'expertise to accurately explain complicated studies and research. '
            '“You hear stories all the time of major state outlets that once '
            'had 400 in a newsroom and now are down to 50,” Abernathy said. '
            '“There used to be three people responsible for covering health '
            'and now there’s just one person who’s responsible for covering, '
            'if you’re lucky, not only health but a range of other things.” '
            'The format of local news, with its staunch adherence to the '
            'appearance of neutrality, can also create openings for '
            'misinformation. In some instances, anti-vaccine activists have '
            'been given equal time as opposing voices during televised '
            'coverage of vaccinations – as was the case in a local NBC News '
            'San Diego report last November that gave airtime to an avowed '
            'anti-vax organization for a segment on “Mixed Reactions About '
            'Covid-19 Vaccine.” The result was a false equivalence between the '
            'two sides, presenting anti-vaccine activists as a contrarian '
            'viewpoint, rather than debunking their medical misinformation. '
            'NBC News San Diego did not respond to a request for comment. '
            '“It’s an old tradition in journalism to get both sides of the '
            'story and unfortunately that tradition has carried a little too '
            'far into the science coverage domain,” said Rick Weiss, the '
            'director of SciLine, an organization that connects reporters with '
            'scientists and is based out of the non-profit American '
            'Association for the Advancement of Science. “But when there’s '
            'just overwhelming evidence that something is true and other '
            'things are not true, that’s not the time to give equal coverage.” '
            'Politically motivated media moves in Other local news media have '
            'made a concerted effort to promote anti-vaccine narratives or '
            'help spread information about unproven treatments.\n'
            'Conservative radio hosts and rightwing websites targeting local '
            'news consumers have repeatedly promoted anti-vaccine views to '
            'their audiences. Many of these radio shows air on multiple '
            'stations and are available online through platforms such as the '
            'iHeartRadio network. Radio host Joshua Lane has hosted fawning '
            'interviews with multiple anti-vaccine activists in recent months, '
            'including Robert F Kennedy Jr. and other members of his '
            'organization. Lane’s show airs on five AM and FM stations across '
            'multiple states, including ABC News Radio affiliate station KMET '
            'in Los Angeles. Lane has called Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine '
            'organization an “excellent organization doing some very good '
            'work.” Lane did not respond to the Guardian’s request for '
            'comment. Meanwhile, a series of local news sites such as '
            'Washington State’s Clark County Today, the Atlanta Business '
            'Journal and California’s the Desert Review have all published '
            'content either from prominent anti-vaccine groups or advocates '
            'for unproven Covid-19 treatments. Although they have innocuous '
            'names that mimic traditional local news outlets, their content '
            'often promotes anti-vaccine views or furthers Covid-19 conspiracy '
            'theories. Researchers have come to call these types of '
            'organizations “pink slime” outlets and they have become a growing '
            'part of the media landscape in recent years. “The problem that '
            'occurs with this is that they don’t have the same journalistic '
            'standards, many of them have a decided political agenda to them,” '
            'Abernathy said. In one post from early October, Clark County '
            'Today, which was founded by David Madore, a wealthy Republican '
            'donor who has bankrolled local candidates in Washington state, '
            'republished an article from the anti-vaccine Children’s Health '
            'Defense group in full. Another article on the site covers local '
            'support for a physician’s assistant whom the state medical '
            'commission suspended in October for advocating for ivermectin, '
            'but does not mention allegations of him attempting to bully local '
            'hospital staff into prescribing the drug and spreading medical '
            'misinformation that resulted in the suspension.\n'
            'In a lengthy response, Clark County Today’s editor, Ken Vance, '
            'told the Guardian that the site’s coverage of the pandemic was '
            'informed by the “one-sided” approach from “mainstream news media, '
            'social media and even Big Tech”. He added the site does not try '
            'to shape readers’ personal decisions around vaccinations, and has '
            'published “endless information about vaccinations, treatment and '
            'other Covid-related issues, allowing elected officials, '
            'government leaders and medical health providers to inform the '
            'community”. But, he added, “those sources continually refuse to '
            'even address issues such as adverse effects to vaccinations, '
            'alternative treatments for Covid and even preventative measures '
            'that can be taken to boost one’s immune system.” But health '
            'experts argue that promoting unproven treatments or framing the '
            'efficacy of vaccination as a debate is a way for anti-vaccine '
            'advocates to further their cause. Anti-vaxxers also rely on out '
            'of context anecdotes and demonstrably false arguments, one doctor '
            'told the Guardian, in their attempts to contest well-documented '
            'research and medical science. The Desert Review, whose publisher '
            'has shared pro-Trump conspiracy theories on Facebook, has '
            'published a series of pro-ivermectin articles from an author who '
            'writes under a pseudonym and makes allegations of a '
            'pharmaceutical conspiracy against the drug. They are frequently '
            'shared in social media groups promoting the drug, and listed as '
            'the most popular articles on the site. In October, the site '
            'posted a celebratory message on Facebook touting that one of its '
            'ivermectin articles had been viewed hundreds of thousands of '
            'times. The Desert Review and WEAR TV news did not respond to '

{'article': 'Here is a film about gambling from writer-director Paul Schrader '
            'and producer Martin Scorsese that begins with a closeup of the '
            'queen of spades – I’m betting it’s a sly reference to the Thorold '
            'Dickinson classic of the same title, about the game Faro, in '
            'which that card is such a terrible omen of ill fortune. Schrader '
            'has created another drama about obsessive masculinity, fragile '
            'hope and potent despair competing for dominance in the heart of a '
            'man roaming a nocturnal world of sin – naturally it’s impossible '
            'not to see the echo of Schrader’s screenplay for the 1976 classic '
            'Taxi Driver. What did Travis Bickle actually do in Vietnam? (Or '
            'is the whole point that we don’t know?) And what if instead of a '
            'young girl Travis was trying to redeem it was a young man, a '
            'younger version of himself? In various small-scale casinos across '
            'the US – not in the Vegas league – a professional gambler '
            'discreetly plies his trade: this is William “Tell” Tillich, '
            'played by Oscar Isaac, his seductive sleepy-eyed address to the '
            'camera making him look tired, gaunt and even lizardly. William '
            'counts cards at blackjack: that is, by memorising every card '
            'played, he can calculate the moment at which to bet big, but '
            'knows enough to keep his winnings modest to avoid getting barred. '
            'In any case he is more interested in poker. William has learned '
            'fierce personal discipline, card skills and toxic self-hate in '
            'military prison. In every budget motel he stays, William takes '
            'all the pictures down and wraps the furnishings in sackcloth to '
            'make his room like a cell, or something worse than that.\n'
            'During a hotel poker tournament, William wanders into a '
            'commercial convention on ex-military security techniques and '
            'comes across a certain young man: Cirk (Tye Sheridan). Cirk makes '
            'William an offer: to help him kill someone of their mutual '
            'acquaintance. William counter-offers: Cirk can come on the road '
            'with him and learn the world of gambling. Does William want to '
            'mentor Cirk – teach him to channel this rage and hurt into the '
            'casinos’ soulless but harmless world the way he has done? But '
            'William doesn’t seem to be teaching Cirk anything concrete about '
            'card games: is this just a cover so he can co-opt Cirk’s '
            'murderous plan? Schrader’s movie is great at showing the airless, '
            'affectless world of the casino itself, as well as the grim setup '
            'of the poker tournaments in the opening rounds, with contestants '
            'squashed together in something as unglamorous as a bingo hall. '
            'Robert Altman’s gambling movie California Split from 1974 showed '
            'something similar, and William and Cirk are a bit like a less '
            'intimate version of the tragicomic buddy pairing of George Segal '
            'and Elliott Gould in that film, or perhaps more like Philip Baker '
            'Hall and John C Reilly’s master-pupil gambling relationship in '
            'Paul Thomas Anderson’s Hard Eight in 1996.\n'
            'Cirk has come into William’s life at the exact moment that '
            'something good is happening to him, if only he could see it. '
            'Gambler turned talent spotter La Linda, played by Tiffany '
            'Haddish, asks William if he would be interested in turning pro '
            'for various high-roller backers of her acquaintance: but actually '
            'she has feelings for this coolly reserved tough guy, and the '
            'always-likable Haddish nicely conveys her hurt feelings when '
            'William maladroitly tells her how much their “friendship” means '
            'to him. Schrader has carpentered a strong and vehement film, '
            'hypnotically watchable and squalid with nightmarish flashbacks '
            'and a typically apocalyptic ending that grows plausibly enough '
            'out of what has gone before. There’s a horrible, queasy urgency '

            'early lead after polls closed that he maintained throughout the '
            'evening, while McAuliffe lagged in key counties that Biden swept '
            'in 2020. Clenching his fists then clapping his hands, Youngkin '
            'addressed jubilant supporters in Chantilly just after 1am. “All '

            'race\n'
            'The former police officer Eric Adams will be the next mayor of '
            'New York City, after the Democrat defeated Curtis Sliwa in '
            'Tuesday’s election. Adams was on course to easily beat Sliwa, the '
            'founder of the Guardian Angels, with a lead of 66% to 29% after '
            'more than half of projected votes were counted. Adams will take '

            'faced with overseeing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, '
            'which has killed more than 34,500 New Yorkers. Adams, 61, becomes '
            'only the second Black person to be elected New York mayor, after '
            'David Dinkins, who led the city from 1990 to 1993. Adams, who '
            'defeated several progressive candidates in the Democratic '
            'primary, has pledged to cut government inefficiency and made '
            'public safety a central part of his campaign. After winning a '
            'contentious primary, Adams was always favorite to defeat Sliwa, a '
            'Republican, in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans seven '

            'murderers is test for racial justice ‘in the heart of white '
            'supremacy’ On Tuesday, after 11 days of jury selection, a panel '
            'of 65 jurors was chosen from a pool of hundreds in the murder '
            'trial of three white men accused in the killing Ahmaud Arbery, '
            'the 25-year-old Black man shot dead last year while out for a '
            'jog. Barring any unforeseen delays, including last-minute motions '

            '12 and four alternates will be seated this week, with opening '
            'arguments to follow, probably on Thursday. The trial of the three '
            'men, who have pleaded not guilty, occurs six months after the '
            'conviction of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who '
            'murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis after pinning his neck to '
            'the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. That trial was '
            'undoubtedly a landmark moment for police reform advocates around '
            'the country, but, say many observers, the case of Ahmaud Arbery '
            'is a sterner test for the state of racial justice in the US. Who '
            'is standing trial for Arbery’s murder? Gregory McMichael, 67, his '
            '35-year-old son, Travis McMichael, and their neighbor William '
            '“Roddie” Bryan, 52 are accused of his murder. What happened? A '
            'scuffle occurred as the McMichaels, both carrying firearms, '
            'attempted to corner Arbery, who was unarmed. Travis McMichael '
            'then opened fire three times. They said they suspected Arbery of '

{'article': 'Australia has been accused of “greenwashing” its aid to the '
            'Pacific, with the government claiming that major projects are '
            'significantly focused on climate adaptation when they have little '
            'or no link to climate change or the environment. The accusations, '
            'in a new report by Greenpeace Australia Pacific, come after Scott '
            'Morrison announced an additional $500m for international climate '
            'finance for projects in the Indo-Pacific on the first day of the '
            'Cop26 summit in Glasgow. But analysis by Greenpeace found that '
            'fewer than one-quarter of all aid projects in 2018 and 2019 that '
            'the Australian government labelled “significantly focused” on '
            'climate adaptation made any mention of climate change or '
            'environmental concerns.\n'
            '“We’ve seen the Morrison government over the last few years be '
            'really loud and proud about its climate aid to the Pacific,” said '
            'Alex Edney-Browne, the investigations officer at Greenpeace '
            'Australia Pacific, and report author. “But climate aid in the '
            'Pacific has been greenwashed. The Australian government really '
            'needs to drastically improve the transparency and the accuracy of '
            'its reporting, otherwise there’s no guarantee that this aid is '
            'actually going to improve the climate resiliency in the Pacific.” '
            'In 2018, Australia spent US$255.07m on aid that was '
            '“significantly focused” on climate adaptation, compared to '
            'US$26.94m on projects that were “principally focused” on it, such '
            'as sea walls, cyclone-proofed infrastructure and mangrove '
            'planting initiatives. However, the Greenpeace report found that '
            'in 2018 only 23% of the “significantly focused” projects '
            'mentioned anything to do with climate change in reports on the '
            'projects.\n'
            'One of the most striking examples found by Edney-Browne was a '
            'governance facility in Papua New Guinea, which over 2018 and 2019 '
            'received more than US$80m in Australian aid. “This was about '
            'political administration, improving political participation, '
            'decreasing corruption in Papua New Guinea, so no obvious link '
            'there to climate change,” she said. “I even read a 113-page '
            'evaluation of the project that Dfat [the Department of Foreign '
            'Affairs and Trade] commissioned and not a single mention of '
            'climate adaptation in that whole report.” Sign up to receive an '
            'email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'The findings tally with those contained in a report from Terence '
            'Wood, a research fellow at the Development Policy Centre at the '
            'Crawford School of Public Policy, published earlier this year. '
            '“If you’re a donor such as Australia, with your aid budget not '
            'going up but at the same time all these announcements about '
            'increased climate finance are being made … your easiest way out '
            'of a difficult bind might be to be … lenient in how you classify '
            'some of your projects,” Wood said. “If you’re suitably creative '
            'as a donor, you can convince yourself at least that almost '
            'anything is associated with climate change adaptation or '
            'mitigation. You build a school and you build it a couple of '
            'hundred metres inland, and you might tell yourself, the fact we '
            'built this school inland means we’re helping this country adapt '
            'to climate change.”\n'
            'But the tendency to do this was concerning and could get in the '
            'way of meaningful action on climate projects, he said, and '
            'undermined Australia’s reputation in the region. “Australia '
            'really could be earning a reputation for itself in the Pacific as '
            'a decent friend for the region, who gave its aid with the needs '
            'of the region in mind, and when it starts doing dubious things '
            'with its climate finance or making promises that look like '
            'they’re larger than they are, that’s probably going to undermine '
            'Australia’s reputation and its ability to come across as a good '
            'friend in the Pacific … That on top of the fact that Australia '
            'isn’t cutting its emissions in a meaningful way nearly as rapidly '
            'as it needs to be.” Edney-Browne agreed, saying it left Pacific '
            'countries in a bind. “We’ve got to remember Pacific countries are '
            'absolute climate champions and sovereign countries, and really '
            'great leaders in the climate movement, but they’re still '
            'developing countries that are still very vulnerable to climate '
            'change, they’ve really suffered the effects of Covid-19, so that '
            'power that Australia wields over them through aid and aid '
            'dependency is significant.” Dfat was contacted for comment.',

{'article': 'A Labor MP gave a staffer more than $33,000 to pay the party '
            'memberships of people within her faction, according to evidence '
            'provided to the Victorian anti-corruption commission. But the MP, '
            'Marlene Kairouz, whose evidence is considered critical to the '
            'investigation into the alleged misuse of public funds by paying '
            'staff to do factional activity – including branch stacking – will '
            'not be subject to a public examination by the Independent '
            'Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac). Branch stacking is '
            'not illegal but it is a breach of party rules, as is the payment '
            'of other people’s party memberships. Chris Carr SC, counsel '
            'assisting the commission, told the hearing on Wednesday that Ibac '
            'investigators had obtained bank records showing transfers between '
            'Kairouz and Kirsten Psaila, her electorate office manager.\n'
            'Psaila worked for Kairouz from 2008 when she was elected. In '
            '2015, Kairouz transferred Psaila $14,700, Carr said, followed by '
            '$18,300 the next year. Both transfers were made during “renewal '
            'season”, Carr said, around the time membership fees were due. '
            'Psaila agreed during her evidence on Wednesday that following '
            'both transfers she withdrew the cash to pay for memberships. She '
            'said that Kairouz also paid for memberships in 2017, but that she '
            'had provided her cash, rather than a bank transfer, that year. '
            'Carr told the commission that Kairouz would be the next witness, '
            'but that because Ibac had received “credible” information a '
            'public examination could unreasonably damage her reputation, '
            'safety or wellbeing she would be examined in private. There were '
            'four “stringent” criteria within the Ibac Act that must be '
            'satisfied to allow public hearings, Carr said, and the emergence '
            'of evidence that suggested Kairouz would be unreasonably damaged '
            'meant that her “critical” answers to matters of “significant '
            'public interest” had to be given in private. Kairouz stood down '
            'as a minister after an Age-60 minutes investigation last year '
            'aired allegations of her involvement in branch stacking. She has '
            'denied all wrongdoing. She took leave from parliament in '
            'September following the sudden death of her sister. Sign up to '
            'receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia '
            'every morning\n'
            'Carr asked Psaila about the details of the work she did on behalf '
            'of Kairouz and the moderate faction, including the bulk '
            'collection and filling out of ballot papers on behalf of members '
            'so as to control their votes in party elections. She gave '
            'evidence of “captains” within the faction, who were responsible '
            'for doing this on behalf of dozens of members, and also took '
            'responsibility for renewing their memberships every year. Carr '
            'said Ibac had uncovered evidence of systemic forgeries of party '
            'member signatures occurring across the electorate offices of two '
            'MPs, including the office of Kairouz, but Psaila said she did not '
            'know who was responsible for this. After extensive questioning '
            'from Carr and the commissioner, Robert Redlich QC, Psaila – who '
            'herself had been accused but denied forging a document on behalf '
            'of a member in the mid-2000s – conceded that it had crossed her '
            'mind such forgeries could be occurring. The reason for forging '
            'signatures, Carr said, was that it would dramatically speed up '
            'the laborious process of obtaining ballot papers on behalf of '
            'members, taking it to them to sign, before numbering each ballot '
            '(from one to about 120 in some instances) and sending it back to '
            'ALP head office. Psaila said she was idealistic as a Labor '
            'staffer, had ambitions to become an MP herself, and had been '
            'brought up in a Labor family. She said she was introduced to '
            'factional politics by George Seitz, who she agreed was a '
            '“notorious branch stacker”.\n'
            'Seitz organised the preselection of Kairouz, and she also became '
            'responsible for some of his members after he retired, Psaila '
            'said. Carr described Psaila as a small cog in a much larger '
            'machine, and suggested to her that those who used this machine to '
            'become MPs would not have a strong moral compass. “I can only '
            'comment for Marlene,” Psaila said. “She’s a stand-up MP in the '
            'local community and she does what she can for the area.” Carr '
            'responded: “That may be so, but she’s administered a part of this '
            'corrosive and corruption factional machinery, hasn’t she?” “They '
            'all have,” Psaila replied. Earlier in Wednesday’s hearing, '
            'Redlich raised concerns he had about evidence provided on Monday '
            'by Christine Kelly, an electorate officer for Kairouz. Kelly had '
            'claimed she had no knowledge of or interest in the 2018 ALP '
            'national conference election, despite Ibac hearing evidence on '
            'Wednesday that Kelly was standing as a delegate during that '
            'election. At one stage in Psaila’s evidence, Redlich also warned '
            'her not to fall into the same “trap” as Kelly, of moving from a '
            'position of knowing nothing at all about anybody doing any '
            'factional work in the office, to admitting significantly more '
            'knowledge after several hours of questioning. Public hearings are '
            'scheduled to resume on Monday.',

{'article': 'Angela Merkel’s marathon tenure as Germany’s leader may have '
            'officially crossed the finishing line with September’s federal '
            'elections, but her final lap of honour could take some time. '
            'Depending on the pace of coalition talks between the politicians '
            'hoping to fill her shoes, she may yet give one more of her annual '
            'TV addresses in a caretaker capacity this Christmas. Still, as a '
            'new generation of German leaders rises to the fore and Merkel '
            'recedes into the background, the contours of her legacy are '
            'becoming easier to distinguish. There are quantifiable historic '
            'firsts: 16 years in office make her the joint longest-serving '
            'chancellor of the postwar era, equalling the record of her former '
            'mentor Helmut Kohl. She’s the first German chancellor to have the '
            'wisdom to step down of her own will, at the end of a full term. '
            'She’s the first female German head of government, the first with '
            'a scientist’s training, and the first to have grown up in a '
            'socialist command economy. She may go down in history as a '
            'once-in-a-century political adaptor, connecting two differently '
            'hardwired systems kept apart by the Berlin Wall.\n'
            'Yet it’s also possible that Merkel may not be remembered as a '
            'pioneer, but as the last example of an idea that feels '
            'increasingly old-fashioned in an age where more and more '
            'political tribes are built around personal identity: leadership '
            'as an exercise in ego suppression, holding high office as '
            'tantamount to covering the very traits that make you unique. '
            'Hungarian-American author Kati Marton is especially fascinated by '
            'this aspect of Merkel’s tenure: the intense privacy of a woman '
            'who rose to power in an era of oversharing. “After several '
            'decades, Germans are not tired of her image, her voice, her '
            'looming persona – because Merkel does not loom,” Marton writes in '
            'her biography, in response to the German leader’s enduringly high '
            'popularity ratings. “Despite knowing little about their '
            'chancellor’s private life, other than that she comes across as '
            'leading a life not so different from their own, Germans thrice '
            'reelected her, each time by a comfortable margin.” From Marton’s '
            'US perspective, the contrast is especially glaring: while Donald '
            'Trump’s stint in the White House became a reality TV show, '
            'broadcast in real time through tweets and continual leaks, '
            'Merkel’s chancellory is famously gossip proof. Marton writes that '
            'her obsession with privacy “verges on paranoia”. The world was '
            'privy to Trump’s every idle thought via Twitter; Merkel, however, '
            'keeps no journal, does not use email, and “texts only briefly and '
            'when necessary”. Her long-standing, mostly female set of advisers '
            'is not only intensely loyal but almost invisible to the media’s '
            'eye. Those who have been unwise enough to blab found themselves '
            'banished from her inner circle: one political ally, Marton '
            'writes, was never allowed back into Merkel’s confidence after '
            'releasing a four-word email with the following explosive content: '
            '“Thanks for the suggestion, AM.” Few Germans are even aware that '
            'their chancellor has a sister and a brother, because they lead '
            'ordinary lives doing ordinary jobs and never speak to the press. '
            'Her first husband, Ulrich Merkel, whose surname she kept after '
            'their divorce in 1982, once gave a reluctant on-the-spot '
            'interview in which he praised his ex for her stance during the '
            'refugee crisis of 2015. Perhaps after Merkel has left office '
            'proper there will be a biography that will lift the veil on her '
            'private motivations; Marton’s diligently compiled but often '
            'overtly reverential chronological overview is not it. In spite of '
            'numerous interviews with close advisers, touted as “circumventing '
            'the chancellor’s extraordinary need for control”, there are few '
            'revelations here that cast a new light on her leadership. Marton '
            'notes how Merkel was the daughter of a Protestant pastor and the '
            'former head of a party with the word “Christian” in its name. She '
            'believes her “private faith, and the Bible, would steady her '
            'sometimes rocky path”, as well as provide a connection with the '
            'first US president she met in office, George W Bush. She may well '
            'be right, but this book doesn’t present any evidence to back up '
            'that claim, nor does it explore how Merkel’s specifically East '
            'German Lutheran brand of Christianity may have influenced her. '
            'Marton believes Merkel to be a feminist, even if the chancellor '
            'herself only used the term to describe herself for the first time '
            'last month (in a panel discussion with the the novelist '
            'Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). But as with her East German '
            'background, the chancellor’s sex was never converted into a '
            'policy priority. In fact, little of Germany’s progress on gender '
            'equality over the last 16 years can be directly put down to '
            'Merkel’s leadership: she initially opposed her labour minister '
            'Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal for legally mandated gender '
            'quotas for senior management positions. At times, there is a '
            'slightly comical sense that the qualities Merkel’s biographer '
            'finds most intriguing are also those that most elude her: Marton, '
            'who also grew up east of the Iron Curtain and went on to become '

{'article': 'This year, there is one game world I have enjoyed exploring more '
            'than any other. We’re so spoiled for visually rich open '
            'environments these days, it takes something special to keep '
            'players immersed, to keep them wandering about looking at stuff, '
            'just for the sake of it. Deathloop is a shining example. '
            'Developer Arkane is known for its highly refined and individual '
            'approach to game art, thanks to the astonishing Dishonored '
            'titles, set in a steam-punk dystopia of rats, robotic guards and '
            'ornate classical architecture. This time around, the team created '
            'a strange Groundhog Day-like adventure set on an island populated '
            'by mad scientists and spoiled billionaires, all looking to gain '
            'immortality by living the same day over and over again, thanks to '
            'a localised space-time phenomenon. The island of Blackreef, where '
            'the whole game takes place, provides a fascinating example of how '
            'Arkane works. At first, the team built a timeline to explain the '
            'variety of natural and human-made features in each region. The '
            'location itself is a remote, wintery outpost, heavily inspired by '
            'the Faroe Islands, with craggy cliffs and windswept grasslands. '
            'On top of this are the monolithic concrete buildings constructed '
            'by a group of military researchers who arrived in the 1930s to '
            'investigate the island’s weird phenomena. And then, decades later '
            'came Aeon, a cabal of rich tech bros, looking for a new '
            'playground. “It was kind of like if Elon Musk had said, ‘let’s go '
            'to the Bermuda Triangle and study it’!” explains art director Seb '
            'Mitton. “They came with all this money and realised they could '
            'create these strange events. They said ‘we’re going to start this '
            'loop and we’re going to live forever.’”\n'
            'So in the island’s architecture, you see different layers '
            'co-existing: the island’s flora, the military buildings, with '
            'bunkers and towering antenna (inspired by abandoned sites in '
            'northern Europe, Japan and Russia, such as Chenobyl), and in '
            'addition, a hedonistic society, re-purposing and re-decorating '
            'everything they see. For this element, Mitton and his team were '
            'heavily inspired by the end of the 1960s. “It was all about '
            'freedom of mind,” he said. “If you think about hippies, people '
            'really wanted change at that time, people wanted to live '
            'differently, but you had the cold war as well; there was a lot of '
            'violence. We found inspiration in the era of the Vietnam war – '
            'that helped us build the Aeon programme: the visionaries and '
            'their guests – what are their goals in life? For some it’s '
            'drinking all day, it’s partying, for others it’s about killing '
            'people. But there are no consequences because there is no '
            'tomorrow, so, even though there’s a lot of violence, it’s very '
            'lighthearted.” The 60s influence is clear in the game’s interiors '
            '– the buildings throughout are filled with brash, multicoloured '
            'furnishings, weird art and gigantic Saul Bass-style posters. '
            'However, Mitton’s team worked hard to avoid kitsch excesses – '
            'they didn’t want it to become Austin Powers: the game. “At the '
            'same time, we looked at contemporary materials and there were a '
            'lot of rugs, a lot of rounded plastics – it was very different to '
            'what we did in the Dishonored games, where it was a lot of '
            'straight lines. There’s a big contrast between the outside where '
            'everything is cold and hard, and the interiors, where everything '
            'is colourful. At Arkane, we love creating contrast because it '
            'plays with the player’s emotions. We also developed different '
            'layers depending on each of the visionaries’ background: some '
            'build laboratories, but Frank has a casino – for him it’s a '
            'party. So we took these different themes inspired by the 60s and '
            'we developed them differently to reflect the characters.”\n'
            'Another big influence on the interior architecture was Frank '
            'Lloyd Wright, whose approach suited the experience Arkane wanted '
            'to provide. As he explains, “He made these huge offices and in '
            'our game that’s very useful – we couldn’t make very small '
            'interiors because we want a lot of mobility. Also, he was one of '
            'the first architects to work with diffused light – so you’d look '
            'up and think you were seeing the ceiling but actually it was the '
            'light behind it. It was such a different approach to office '
            'design. For the parties, we looked at how he lit interiors to '
            'make inside light look like outside light, we looked at all his '
            'work with lines and wooden curves. As soon as you go in Joanna’s '
            'house at the very beginning of the game, you see the 1960s has '
            'taken hold: these big rooms, huge lamps, feature fireplaces – '
            'that’s 60s interior design.” Mitton reels off the cinematic '
            'influences on the look of the game. It feels like Kubrick is in '
            'there, as well as Roger Vadim, but he also cites Jacques Tati’s '
            'futuristic classic Playtime, and Tarantino’s Jackie Brown. '
            'Importantly though, the townscapes in Deathloop are designed to '
            'be play spaces, to encourage joyful exploration. Here, the team '
            'was inspired by Italian towns such as Positano, which tumble down '
            'steep cliffs towards the sea and look climbable. “You see it on '
            'Google Earth or Street View – and you think ‘I could jump from '
            'this roof to that one, that would be great’. We call our '
            'districts mini open worlds because they’re not linear, you can go '
            'everywhere, there are very few buildings closed off – some that '
            'are closed during the day might be open in the evening. We play a '
            'lot with physics and water levels, so some places unlock when '
            'tides go out. It’s really important to make sure players don’t '
            'get burned out. When people play Dishonored, even today they’ll '
            'still find different passageways.” For the strange costumes worn '
            'by the game’s non-player characters, Mitton looked at late-60s '
            'fashion. It was an era in which people were moving away from '
            'tailored clothes, toward expressive fashion with lots of new '
            'fabrics and printing technologies. “With swinging London,” he '
            'says. “People really took hold of their look, they joined fashion '
            'gangs. We looked at Twiggy, she really brought forward that whole '
            'ready-to-wear, off-the-rack look. People would choose clothing '
            'and assemble their own style. We’re still Arkane, though, so we '
            'always look at the lines, we make sure everything reflects the '
            'light beautifully, we looked at new shaders for the different '
            'fabrics …”\n'
            'The decision to have all the characters wear masks was partly '
            'technological (it’s still difficult to portray authentic emotions '
            'on the face of a game character), but it was also about the idea '
            'of using fashion, design and art to express emotion. Aeon is '
            'living like an endless party, so it made sense to express this in '
            'the decoration of the streets and buildings – such as the '
            'coloured powders used in Hindu festivals, or the paint-throwing '
            'in the Cascamorras festivals of Andalucia, or of course, the vast '
            'street murals of the hippy era. “I mean sometimes they’d paint '
            'entire building facades,” says Mitton. “There are pubs in London '
            'that were entirely painted, even the roof tiles, and these were '
            'exterior projections of their emotions: this is our party, our '
            'place. For the people of Aeon, why not just live an exalted crazy '
            'life?!” I think that’s why the world of Deathloop is so arresting '
            'and explorable – it isn’t just a pastiche of historical '
            'architecture and design. Everything has a place in the fiction of '
            'the world, and everything expresses an underlying theme or idea. '
            'As Mitton puts it, “we looked at the Beatles and Rolling Stones, '
            'but we tried to understand what was cool about those haircuts, '
            'and what was just too goofy.” He pauses for a second before '
            'adding. “That took us a really long time.”',

{'article': 'A battle is being fought in Washington over the Biden '
            'administration’s nuclear weapons policy, amid fears by arms '
            'control advocates that the president will renege on campaign '
            'promises to rein in the US arsenal. The battlegrounds are a '
            'nuclear posture review (NPR) due early next year and a defence '
            'budget expected about the same time. At stake is a chance to put '
            'the brakes on an arms race between the US, Russia and China – or '
            'the risk of that race accelerating.\n'
            'Despite Biden’s pledge during the campaign – and in his interim '
            'national security guidance issued in March – that his '
            'administration would reduce “our reliance and excessive '
            'expenditure on nuclear weapons”, hawks at the Pentagon have won '
            'the early skirmishes. Biden is also under pressure from some '
            'allies, nervous about Biden’s past support for limiting the use '
            'of nuclear weapons to the “sole purpose” of deterring, and '
            'retaliating against, a nuclear attack on the US or its allies. '
            'The current US posture is broader, leaving open a nuclear '
            'response to “significant non-nuclear strategic attacks”. Britain '
            'and France also retain a certain amount of ambiguity about when '
            'they would use their weapons, and are concerned a US change to '
            '“sole purpose” would oblige them ultimately to narrow their '
            'options. Paris has taken the lead in conveying those anxieties, '
            'and Emmanuel Macron raised nuclear posture issues with Biden when '
            'the two met in Rome on Friday. The big struggle, however, is on '
            'the home front, where arms control advocates are on the '
            'defensive. The administration’s first defence budget in February '
            'included $43bn for an array of nuclear modernisation schemes, '
            'including controversial programmes introduced by Donald Trump, '
            'like a new sea-launched cruise missile. The total cost of '
            'modernisation could be over $1.5 trillion. In September, one of '
            'Biden’s political appointees at the Pentagon, Leonor Tomero, who '
            'questioned the need for such a vast and growing nuclear weapons '
            'budget, was forced out in a bureaucratic power struggle after '
            'just nine months in the post. Her job had been to oversee the '
            'drafting of the NPR, which sets out what nuclear weapons the US '
            'should have and under what conditions they could be used. The '
            'official reason for Tomero’s departure was that her job as deputy '
            'assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy had '
            'disappeared as part of efforts to streamline the Pentagon '
            'bureaucracy. “This transition of her duties is the result of a '
            'reorganization decision designed to more appropriately align the '
            'policy’s shop structure with policy objectives,” John Kirby, the '
            'Pentagon spokesman, said. “The nuclear posture review continues '
            'and is being handled by a large group of experts from across the '
            'department under the purview of the under secretary for policy.” '
            'But several congressional sources said that her departure came '
            'after pressure from a Republican hardliner, Senator Deb Fischer '
            'of Nebraska, a staunch supporter of the nuclear weapons '
            'establishment, who threatened to hold up confirmations of senior '
            'Biden nominees if Tomero was not removed.\n'
            'Senator Fischer’s office did not respond to a request for '
            'comment. A Pentagon spokesman said: “I don’t have any information '
            'to provide on this, but generally we cannot comment on personal '
            'discussions between department leadership and members of '
            'Congress.” “It seems like the minute she got there she was under '
            'attack from people who were working behind the scenes, with '
            'congressional Republicans, to put pressure on senior Pentagon '
            'officials to get rid of Leonor,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert in '
            'nuclear non-proliferation and geopolitics at the Middlebury '
            'Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “This is all '
            'about making progressive views on nuclear weapons unacceptable.” '
            'Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, has written to Biden demanding '
            'to know why Tomero had been removed in the midst of drafting the '
            'NPR, demanding to know if “ideology played any role”. Arms '
            'control advocates complain the Democrats have not been as '
            'ruthless as Republicans in pursuit of their policies. A Trump '
            'appointee, Drew Walter, a former senior Republican staffer on the '
            'House armed services committee, has been allowed to “burrow in” '
            'as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear matters, converting '
            'from a political appointee to a career official. Tomero was '
            'Walter’s Democratic counterpart when they were in Congress, but '
            'the Biden administration failed to protect her once she moved to '
            'the Pentagon. Nickolas Roth, the director of the nuclear security '
            'programme at the Stimson Center thinktank, said: “I am concerned '
            'that the removal of Leonor from her position will have a chilling '
            'effect throughout the Biden administration, on those who might be '
            'willing to propose anything other than the status quo for US '
            'nuclear weapons policy.” The deputy national security adviser, '
            'Jonathan Finer, played down concerns that conservatives in the '
            'Pentagon would be able to shape the NPR. “This is going to be the '
            'president’s posture review and the president’s policy,” Finer '
            'insisted at a Ploughshares Fund event last month. “He has asked '
            'the Pentagon, as has been the tradition in the past, to take the '
            'lead on drafting the posture review … but by the time we get to '
            'the end, it will be the president’s document.” With that in mind, '
            'Democrats have been reminding Biden that every dollar spent on '
            'weapons programmes inherited from his predecessors is a dollar '
            'less spent on the social aspirations of the administration. “The '
            'administration must harness this opportunity to rethink the '
            'status quo and not just rubber-stamp the Pentagon and defense '
            'industry’s interest in continuing unnecessary weapons,” Senator '
            'Jeff Merkley told the Guardian. “Business as usual risks fuelling '
            'an unnecessary arms race and squanders billions of dollars that '
            'could go towards improving Americans’ health, education and '
            'housing costs or better investments in national security.”\n'
            'The White House has sought to placate Democrats by agreeing to an '
            'independent review of the feasibility of extending the life of '
            'the current Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, '
            'compared with replacing with it a new weapon, the Ground Based '
            'Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The review is expected to deliver its '
            'conclusions next year, although as the review panel has been '
            'selected by the Pentagon, it is not expected to upset plans to go '
            'ahead with the $100bn GBSD.\n'
            'China’s nuclear weapons development, including the recent '
            'reported testing of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glider launched '
            'from orbit, has increased the political pressure on Biden to '
            'abandon his arms control pledges, although the Chinese arsenal is '
            'still dwarfed by the US total of 3,750 warheads. Emma Belcher, '
            'the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control advocacy '
            'organisation, argued that China’s rise as a nuclear weapons power '
            'only underlines the urgency of arms control. “The best way to '
            'control the situation and head off an arms race with China is '
            'through diplomacy and restraint,” Belcher said. “We’ve seen this '
            'movie before. It’s expensive and dangerous. So what we’re hoping '
            'we’ll see from the NPR is for diplomacy to be put first, and an '
            'off ramp from a new kind of cold war.”',

{'article': 'A University of Oxford college is to change its name to honour '
            'Vietnam’s richest woman after she offered it a £155m donation. '
            'Linacre College says it will ask the privy council for permission '
            'to change its name to Thao College after signing a memorandum of '
            'understanding over the money with Sovico Group – represented by '
            'its chair, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. The graduate college, founded '
            'in 1962, is named after the Renaissance humanist, medical '
            'scientist and classicist Thomas Linacre. The donation will help '
            'to pay for a new graduate centre and graduate access '
            'scholarships, the college has said. “We have long been one of the '
            'least well-endowed colleges at the university, so we are '
            'delighted that a significant part of the donation will be for our '
            'general endowment fund, to help support the daily running of '
            'college,” it said.\n'
            '“Sovico Group has also committed to all their subsidiaries '
            'reaching net zero carbon by the end of 2050 with the input from '
            'leading Oxford academics. “After receiving the first donation of '
            '£50m, we will approach the privy council to ask for permission to '
            'change our name from Linacre College to Thao College in '
            'recognition of this landmark gift.” At Oxford there has been '
            'disquiet over Thao’s donation to the institution, which has '
            'styled itself as “one of the greenest colleges in Oxford”. '
            'Sovico’s business interests include offshore oil and gas '
            'exploration, fossil fuel financing, and Vietnam’s first private '
            'airline. According to the Tab, Thao made much of her fortune from '
            'the budget airline VietJet Air, which is controlled by Sovico. '
            'The conglomerate is also the largest shareholder in HDBank, on '
            'the board of which she also serves as vice-chair. HDBank is the '
            'main financer of the state-owned Vietnam National Petroleum '
            'Group. Dr Maria Kawthar Daouda, a lecturer in French literature '
            'at Oxford, told the Telegraph college names should not be altered '
            'simply because “a major gift has been made”. “Thankfulness for '
            'Madam Thao’s money could be expressed in ways that do not erase '
            'what the donation is meant to protect,” Daouda said. Another don, '
            'who was not identified, was more relaxed about the change. “If '
            'this were one of the great historic colleges one would have deep '
            'reservations,” he said. “But as it’s a modern college and has not '
            'got a big endowment, one can understand the decision. If someone '
            'is going to put in a colossal amount of money, it’s not '
            'unreasonable to have something to show for it.”',

{'article': 'Average UK house prices defied expectations and continued to '
            'climb last month despite the phasing out of the government’s '
            'stamp duty holiday at the end of September. The continued '
            'increases mean that the price of an average home in the UK has '
            'risen above £250,000 for the first time on the building society '
            'Nationwide’s index. Other house price indices have already '
            'recorded UK averages above a quarter of a million pounds. '
            'Official figures from the Office for National Statistics based on '
            'mortgage completions put the average price at £264,000 in August, '
            'while the Halifax building society suggested the milestone was '
            'passed in October 2020.\n'
            'Nationwide said house prices increased by 0.7% in October this '
            'year from a month earlier, meaning the price of the average '
            'property has gone up by more than £30,000 since the coronavirus '
            'pandemic began in March 2020. Meanwhile, year-on-year property '
            'price inflation remained at the high level of 9.9% last month, '
            'only just below the 10% level recorded in September. The '
            'threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from £500,000 to '
            '£250,000 in July, before the tax break came to an end in '
            'September. “Demand for homes has remained strong despite the '
            'expiry of the stamp duty holiday at the end of September,” said '
            'Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “Combined with a '
            'lack of homes on the market, this helps to explain why price '
            'growth has remained robust.” There had been expectations that '
            'demand for house purchases would slow after the threshold for '
            'paying stamp duty was lowered from £500,000 to £250,000 in July, '
            'and the tax break then came to an end in September. However, it '
            'is unclear whether house prices will continue to rise in the '
            'coming months and Gardner called the outlook for the housing '
            'market “extremely uncertain”. Further property price inflation is '
            'dependent on a range of factors, including interest rates, '
            'consumer confidence and employment levels after the end of '
            'government pandemic support measures including the furlough '
            'scheme.\n'
            '“If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay '
            'fairly buoyant in the coming months – especially as the market '
            'continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts '
            'in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to '
            'support activity,” Gardner said, adding that interest rate rises '
            'could cool the market. The Bank of England will reveal its latest '
            'interest rate decision on Thursday. Financial markets are betting '
            'on a rate rise, as a result of rising inflation, although most '

{'article': 'There weren’t many silver linings for Scott Morrison in his '
            'extraordinary skirmish with Emmanuel Macron, but one may be that '
            'it has distracted public attention from the prime minister’s '
            'threadbare performance at the Glasgow climate summit. As Morrison '
            'and other leaders flew home from the ongoing talks on Tuesday, '
            'observers were tallying up what the prime minister had committed '
            'to do at a meeting billed as the best, last chance to deal with '
            'the climate crisis. It didn’t take long. Attention then turned to '
            'a more significant list: what the Australian government has not '
            'committed to doing. At the top is one that we have known for a '
            'while: it made no commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions '
            'rapidly, as scientific advice says is necessary. This was the '
            'central point of the Glasgow summit – to ramp up action this '
            'decade, as was agreed under the ratchet mechanism of the Paris '
            'agreement. Countries are expected to lift their short-term '
            'commitments over time on the way to carbon neutrality.\n'
            'The rule of thumb is that global emissions need to be cut roughly '
            'in half this decade. That means substantial action from all major '
            'emitters, particularly the wealthy. New commitments offered '
            'haven’t even come close to that, but they have increased over the '
            'past year. The G7 developed nations and the European Union are '
            'all promising at least a 40% emissions cut by 2030 compared with '
            '(give or take) their highest polluting year. India, the world’s '
            'third-biggest emitter, this week promised that half its '
            'electricity would be renewable by then. Even China, which drew '
            'strong and understandable condemnation from Joe Biden for '
            'president Xi Jinping’s non-appearance in Glasgow, offered a '
            'meagre increase on its 2030 pledges the week before the summit. '
            'Australia didn’t manage that. Morrison went to Glasgow armed with '
            'the same short-term emissions reduction target (a 26-28% cut '
            'compared with 2005) set under Tony Abbott six years ago. The '
            'prime minister was in the awkward position of having to tell the '
            'summit in his speech that the country would probably make a 35% '
            'emissions cut by 2030 – official government projections said so – '
            'but that he would not commit to doing it. Morrison announced some '
            'new climate financing to help the least developed and most '
            'vulnerable, as wealthy nations have promised. The prime minister '
            'described it – and it was reported in some media – as a $2bn '
            'commitment. In reality there was only $500m additional funding '
            'spread over five years, making the new pledge $100m a year '
            'towards an annual global goal of $100bn. It was significantly '
            'less than what many comparable countries have offered. Morrison '
            'said Australia would continue to bypass the global Green Climate '
            'Fund and fund projects in the Indo-Pacific directly.\n'
            'Beyond that, there were two set-piece pledges by national leaders '
            'that drew attention. Australia signed up to one and rejected the '
            'other. The “yes” was to a declaration that global deforestation '
            'would be halted and reversed by 2030. Officials were slow to '
            'confirm Australia supported the initiative. Once they had, the '
            'assistant forestry minister, Jonno Duniam, was quick to say it '
            'would not require the country to stop native forest logging. The '
            'declaration’s main goal is to build support for protecting '
            'ecosystems in developing countries where vast areas are being '
            'felled for agriculture. The “no’’ was to a global pledge to cut '
            'emissions of methane – a short-lived but incredibly potent '
            'greenhouse gas – by 30% by 2030. More than 80 countries signed '
            'up. Those who didn’t included China, India and Russia. Meeting '
            'the methane goal would have required significant action to limit '
            'emissions from coalmines and gas fields – something the Morrison '
            'government has indicated it isn’t prepared to do. Instead, it '
            'muddied the waters, falsely claiming it would have required '
            'farmers to shoot their cattle. Unsurprisingly, given its '
            'well-documented lack of ambition, Australia is not part of the '
            'high ambition coalition, which aims to limit global heating to '
            '1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal that is supposed to be '
            'at the heart of the climate negotiations process. It did sign up '
            'to the Glasgow breakthrough agenda, a collection of five goals '
            'launched by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. These '
            'goals are technology focused – the Morrison government’s '
            'preferred territory – and vaguely defined, but a couple are worth '
            'noting. One is that clean power will be the “most affordable and '
            'reliable option for all countries” by 2030. The important word '
            'here is “clean”, which the Morrison government usually defines as '
            'including gas, a fossil fuel. Another is that zero emissions '
            'vehicles will become the “new normal” and “accessible, affordable '
            'and sustainable” in all regions in 2030. This is clearly at odds '
            'with the Coalition’s politically motivated “end the weekend” '
            'attack on electric vehicles before the 2019 election, but the '
            'government has been gradually inching away from that statement '
            'ever since (though not enough to give EV technology the support '
            'it receives in other countries). A key point about the '
            '“breakthrough” goals is that none are binding, or specific enough '
            'to demand new policies. No one has to do anything. Sound '
            'familiar? As the emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor put it '
            'on Tuesday, they “align strongly with Australia’s approach”.',

{'article': 'Amid black and white Ansel Adams-style cinematography, two Amish '
            'sisters spy on a topless man bathing in a Yosemite river. '
            'Suddenly, a peaceful choral soundtrack gave gives way to '
            'bone-shaking guitar: Inside, the debut single by Scottish grunge '
            'band Stiltskin. Thus began one of the strangest cultural wrinkles '
            'of the 1990s: when Levi’s became a jeans company that could also '
            'score UK chart hits. Inside was built around an addictive riff '
            'that still sounds fresh, and the advert, entitled Creek, shot it '
            'to the top of the UK charts. Over the next few years, the likes '
            'of Babylon Zoo, Smoke City, Mr Oizo and Norman Cook’s pre-Fatboy '
            'Slim project Freak Power would also score major success off the '
            'back of a placement in Levi’s witty, often sexually provocative '
            'adverts. Before Stiltskin, previous Levi’s ads had made renewed '
            'hits out of Muddy Waters’ Mannish Boy, the Clash’s Should I Stay '
            'or Should I Go and Marvin Gaye’s I Heard It Through the Grapevine '
            '(the latter in 1985’s classic, Nick Kamen-in-his-boxers '
            '“Laundrette” ad). The brand used classic blues, rock and soul to '
            'embody the brand’s sense of vintage authenticity. Inside, though, '
            'was the first time the company had used a new artist as their '
            'soundtrack. “When you’re selling the same basic product in the '
            'world of fashion, you have to change something,” explains Sir '
            'John Hegarty, the creative director at London-based creative '
            'agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), who ran the 80s and 90s Levi’s '
            'campaigns. “You can’t change the clothes. So we used the '
            'communication as a way of saying: we’re discovering music, we’re '
            'ahead of fashion.”\n'
            '“My house was being repossessed because I couldn’t pay the '
            'mortgage,” says Stiltskin singer (and later Genesis vocalist) Ray '
            'Wilson, recalling his audition for the band in January 1994. “I '
            'signed on the dole and drove down to London in this old '
            'Volkswagen van that was falling apart. Weeks after, we were No '
            '1.” Released 20 days after Kurt Cobain’s suicide, the song landed '
            'in a musical landscape overrun with grunge bands emulating the '
            '90s Seattle sound. Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, '
            'convinced Inside ripped off their sound, greeted a Munich crowd '
            'later that year with a wry, “Hi, we’re Stiltskin!” The band never '
            'had another hit, something Wilson chalks up to “too much success '
            'too quickly. You can’t go up from there – it’s not the best way '
            'to start a band’s career. We came together within weeks, so we '
            'didn’t have a relationship. We ended up hating each other.” That '
            'anger bled into the band’s performances. “We did MTV’s Most '
            'Wanted and we were told there was something in the region of 20 '
            'million viewers,” he continues. “Me and [guitarist and '
            'songwriter] Peter were at each other. He kicked me in the face. '
            'On one hand MTV were pissed off, but that little clip of Peter '
            'kicking me and the microphone flying out of my hand – they used '
            'that for 12 months on their trailers.” Having your track selected '
            'by Levi’s was enough to at least guarantee a chart hit, albeit '
            'not longevity – but even fleeting success was a temptation. “The '
            'music industry went from: ‘I don’t want to touch advertising’, to '
            'completely swinging round to: ‘Please can we have some of our '
            'music in your ad’,” recalls Hegarty. “It was that '
            'winning-the-lottery phone call,” says Fatboy Slim, AKA Norman '
            'Cook, who, in 1995, was playing keyboards in acid-jazz troupe '
            'Freak Power. “We were slogging around clubs playing gigs and '
            'frankly, we weren’t setting the world alight. We needed something '
            'to kick us up a division.” Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out had reached '
            'No 29 when it was first released, but went Top 5 after being '
            're-released and selected to feature in the 1995 Levi’s ad Taxi. '
            'The commercial showed Filipino-American fashion designer Zaldy, '
            'now better known for making RuPaul’s outfits on Drag Race, taking '
            'a New York taxi in drag, and shocking the cab driver by shaving '
            'her chin mid-drive. Airing at a time when there was little in the '
            'way of LGBTQ+ representation in advertising, it was almost banned '
            'by the Advertising Standards Authority, who finally agreed it '
            'could be shown after 8pm. “The main client [at Levi’s] at the '
            'time was like, ‘Oh my god, we can’t do this’,” remembers Hegarty. '
            '“The people underneath him had to go and convince him it was '

            '“There was one cut I really liked where the whole track stops '
            'when the shaver came on, which also sounded kind of like a '
            'vibrator,” says Cook. “I was very proud of the fact it had this '
            'slightly risque subject matter [for the time].” Most people who '
            'grew up in the 90s will cite Babylon Zoo’s 1995 industrial-glam '
            'hit Spaceman as the Levi’s ad song they remember best. Although, '
            'as Hegarty reveals, the collaboration almost didn’t happen. '
            '“[Vocalist Jas Mann] didn’t want to do it and his manager said, '
            '‘Are you fucking stupid? This is going to make you’.” It would go '
            'on to become the fastest-selling British single since the '
            'Beatles’ Can’t Buy Me Love, despite widespread disappointment '
            'that the pitched-up snippet in the ad wasn’t representative of '
            'the overall track. “Millions of pop kids rushed down Woolies and '
            'bought the single – only to get it home to discover to their '
            'horror that it was ‘good’ (like in the advert) for about 10 '
            'seconds,” Steven Wells wrote in the NME. “Then became rubbish. '
            'Very rubbish.”\n'
            'Still, the Levi’s cachet continued to rise through the 1990s, and '
            'BBH commissioned well-known names to helm their commercials. In '
            '1997, Roman Coppola directed the Brady Bunch-inspired commercial '
            'Daytrippers, soundtracked by US indie band Lilys’ psych-pop '
            'track, A Nanny in Manhattan. The song reached No 16 in the UK – '
            'their only major chart success. Vocalist Kurt Heasley remembers '
            'he felt pressured to follow up with music people could “instantly '
            'grasp by the second chorus. We’re this weird, rare, odd thing and '
            'people were like, ‘More meat! More potato!’ We’re more like '
            'truffle oil on chips.” Also in 1997, Michel Gondry, who would '
            'later direct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and more, was '
            'hired to film the raunchy spot Mermaids. For Smoke City’s '
            'Brazilian-British vocalist Nina Miranda, Gondry’s sensual advert, '
            'which featured a pod of mermaids attempting to relieve a man of '
            'his Levi 501s in the ocean, conjured a sense of escapism. “Levi’s '
            'ads were weird little messages in a bottle from an exotic place '
            'somewhere else,” she says. Miranda had written the track in 1993, '
            'long before Levi’s came calling: “I was really depressed and '
            'living in London. I used to sit in my room, putting ideas to '
            'tape. A DJ friend said: ‘I’m going to make a song just for you’. '
            'I put it on, without having heard it before, and I sang what I '
            'felt which was this incredible trip into water.” Underwater Love '
            'became an underground hit and sparked a bidding war – but once '
            'signed to Zumba Records, Smoke City were frustrated to find the '
            'label wouldn’t promote their debut album, Flying Away, after the '
            'Levi’s ad was confirmed, because they considered the ad such an '
            'effective marketing tool on its own. “We were saying, ‘please '
            'promote the album’, because already people were saying we were '
            'one-hit wonders,” Miranda remembers, though she believes the '
            'commercial was still a blessing rather than a curse. “That song '
            'went all over the world. It opened a lot of doors and people '
            'still remember it.” BBH’s final Levi’s ad of the 90s would be '
            'their most successful of the decade. It featured a headbanging, '
            'fluffy yellow puppet called Flat Eric. Soundtracked by Flat Beat, '
            'French DJ-producer Mr Oizo’s influential bass anthem, it was a '
            'concept Hegarty had to pitch three times in order to get over the '
            'finish line. The single sold millions of copies, spent two weeks '
            'at No 1 in March 1999, and spawned think pieces that pondered '
            'Flat Eric’s position at the intersection of consumerism and '
            'popular culture.\n'
            'But Flat Beat would be the last song to become a major hit after '
            'appearing on a Levi’s ad and BBH turned away from using original '
            'artists in the 2000s. That 90s run is a feat Hegarty thinks could '
            'never happen again. “The way advertising works today, it doesn’t '
            'have quite the confidence – or if I can use that word ‘swagger’ – '
            'as it had back then,” he says. “People have lost confidence in '
            'those big brand statements about what we are, who we are, how we '
            'behave.”\n'
            '“I suppose the modern equivalent would be to have a TikTok hit,” '
            'says Cook, who recently pondered joining the social network with '
            'his manager and label. “We went to TikTok and asked, ‘We know how '
            'to get records on the radio, but how do we get them here?’ And '
            'they said, ‘They just grow ergonomically or organically.’ It’s '
            'not an algorithm that can be influenced.” The difference, Hegarty '
            'says, is the way that the world is fragmented today through '
            'social media. “There’s always a relationship between music and '
            'clothing – the trouble is you’ve not got anyone going out there '
            'making a big statement about it and leading the market,” he says. '
            '“Someone always says to me, ‘How do you predict fashion?’ You '
            'can’t predict fashion. What you can do is write interesting, '
            'challenging, distinctive little stories and that way, you might '
            'have an influence.”',

{'article': 'Facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to cease '
            'collecting photos of Australians from the internet, after it was '
            'revealed police in some states had trialled the technology. On '
            'Wednesday, the information and privacy commissioner determined '
            'Clearview AI had breached the privacy of Australians by '
            'collecting images of them online, and ordered the company to '
            'delete all images of people in Australia within 90 days and not '
            'collect any more. “When Australians use social media or '
            'professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial '
            'images to be collected without their consent by a commercial '
            'entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated '
            'identification purposes,” commissioner Angelene Falk said. “The '
            'indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a '
            'fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement '
            'investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all '
            'Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.” '
            'But Clearview AI has stood its ground, saying it operates '
            'legitimately in Australia and intends to appeal the decision. '
            'Clearview AI is a facial recognition service that claims to have '
            'built up enormous databases – containing more than 3bn labelled '
            'faces – through the controversial practice of scraping photos '
            'from Facebook and other social media sites. Last year, it was '
            'revealed the US-based company had offered trial services to '
            'police in Australia – specifically Queensland police, Victoria '
            'police and the Australian federal police. Reports suggested more '
            'than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the globe had been '
            'using Clearview’s services in early 2020.\n'
            'In response to the scandal, the Office of the Australian '
            'Information Commissioner (OAIC) launched an investigation in '
            'cooperation with the UK’s information commissioner office in July '
            '2020. Clearview AI stands ground Mark Love, a lawyer for BAL '
            'Lawyers acting for Clearview AI, said the company had gone to '
            '“considerable lengths” to cooperate, and claimed “the '
            'commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI '
            'conducts it business”. He said Clearview AI intends to appeal to '
            'the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. “Clearview AI operates '
            'legitimately according to the laws of its places of business,” he '
            'said. “Not only has the commissioner’s decision missed the mark '
            'on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the '
            'commissioner lacks jurisdiction.” The Australian founder and CEO '
            'of Clearview AI, Hoan Ton-That, said he respects the effort the '
            'commissioner put into evaluating the technology he built but said '
            'he is “disheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to '
            'society”. In its response to the OAIC, Clearview AI argued its '
            'images were collected from the internet without requiring a '
            'password or other security clearance. The company also said the '
            'images held by Clearview AI were published in the US, not '
            'Australia, so Australian privacy law should not apply. The OAIC '
            'report noted Clearview AI has not offered services to Australian '
            'organisations since March 2020, but the commissioner said that '
            'didn’t go far enough and all images of people in Australia must '
            'be removed. Police forces in Australia have downplayed their use '
            'of the service, and the OAIC’s investigation found Clearview did '
            'not have any paid customers in Australia. However, the OAIC '
            'report found officers in Australia had successfully searched for '
            'suspects, victims and themselves in the Clearview databases. The '
            'OAIC is still finalising a report on the AFP’s trial of the '
            'technology and whether it complied with the federal privacy code '
            'for government agencies.\n'
            'The ABC reported last year through documents obtained under '
            'freedom of information law that at least one officer tested the '
            'software using photos of herself and another member of staff, '
            'while the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation '
            'conducted searches for five “persons of interest”. The UK’s ICO '
            'is separately considering its next steps and any formal '
            'regulatory action under the UK’s data protection laws. It is the '
            'second ruling the OAIC has made against facial recognition '
            'technology this year, after a similar finding was made against '
            'convenience store giant 7-Eleven last month over the collection '
            'of facial images of people filling out customer surveys across '
            '700 stores, in a bid to weed out fake responses. Facebook this '
            'week also announced a move away from the use of facial '
            'recognition technology on its platform, citing concerns over '
            'privacy and transparency around the use of the technology.',

{'article': '“Nuno Espírito Santo won the manager of the month award for '
            'August, but just 52 days later, he was sacked,” writes Derek '
            'Robertson. “Is this a Premier League record or has someone else '
            'had an even more precipitous fall from grace?” Such is the thirst '
            'for change in some club boardrooms, Nuno’s rapid descent from '
            'August’s best Premier League manager to unemployment can be '
            'beaten. Let’s start at Sheffield Wednesday in 2000, where on 1 '
            'February Danny Wilson received the Premier League manager of the '
            'month award. Just 49 days later, on 21 March, he was cast out in '
            'the cold having won only one in six. On 6 February 2013 Reading’s '
            'Brian McDermott was named manager of the month for January. '
            '“We’ve given ourselves a real chance of league survival,” beamed '
            'McDermott. Four straight defeats and 33 days later, McDermott was '
            'given his marching orders. Predictably, Reading went on to be '
            'relegated.\n'
            'We really ought to take a look at Chelsea, though. The winds of '
            'change blow fiercely in SW6. Claudio Ranieri was sacked 59 days '
            'after winning the March award in 2004, so quick but not quick '
            'enough. Success at this time of year would appear to be deadly '
            'for Chelsea managers. Rafa Benítez won the April award in 2013 '
            'and was let go on 28 May after winning the Europa League, though '
            'he was only ever an interim manager, as Blues fans were so fond '
            'of reminding him. Five years earlier, Avram Grant was handed the '
            'April 2008 award on 9 May and was tossed out of Stamford Bridge a '
            'mere 16 days later (25 May) after the Blues finished second, two '
            'points behind Manchester United. Surely, no one can beat that? '
            'No, but the same club can equal it. Carlo Ancelotti was named '
            'manager of the month for April on 6 May 2011, with the Premier '
            'League panel being impressed after Chelsea’s “three consecutive '
            'home wins over Birmingham, West Ham and Tottenham” gave them '
            '“momentum into their pivotal match with the league leaders” '
            'Manchester United. They lost 2-1 and after a draw with Newcastle '
            'and a defeat at Everton, the champions finished second to United. '
            'Ancelotti was sent packing on 22 May, 16 days later. Had the '
            'Premier League not handed Ancelotti the award as early in the '
            'month as they did, then the Italian could have won this Knowledge '
            'segment instead of sharing the honour with Grant. Four years '
            'later, history repeated itself for poor Carlo. He was sent '
            'packing by second-placed Real Madrid on 25 May, having received '
            'April’s La Liga manager of the month award on 7 May (a gap of '
            'only 18 days). Brits abroad scoring in Europe “On 30 September '

            'regularly pursue careers in Europe until recently, the answer is '
            'not that often, Kenn, but Dirk Maas has plucked out a couple of '
            'examples. “Jonathan Woodgate and David Beckham scored for Real '
            'Madrid against Rosenborg in a Champions League 2005-06 group '
            'stage match,” writes Dirk, who deserves a pat on the back for '

            'light.\n'
            '“And Mark Pembridge and Brian Deane contributed to a comfortable '
            '6-0 victory for Benfica over Beitar Jerusalem in a second '
            'qualification round of the Champions League in 1998-99. At that '

            'achieved this feat, either domestically or abroad?” Yes, they '
            'have and here’s Gary Cumberland with the rundown. “Brentford are '
            'actually the sixth club to do it, although they did it with a lot '
            'more home games in their season. The other unbeaten home teams '

            'Birmingham City (as Small Heath) (17 home games) 1929-30 '
            'Brentford (21 home games) “One interesting note is that even '
            'though they went 100% at home, Brentford (and Birmingham in 1903) '
            'didn’t even win their leagues! In fact, Brentford were a whopping '
            'seven points behind Plymouth Argyle, back when a win was worth '
            'only two points.” Knowledge archive “I am interested in learning '
            'the origins of the expression that a defence was at ‘sixes and '
            'sevens’ in dealing with an attack,” wrote Eric Willis in October '
            '2005. “Can you help?” Off to www.wordorigins.org to answer this '
            'one, Eric, which stated: “‘At sixes and sevens’ is a very old '
            'catchphrase and relates to gambling. It first appears c.1374 in '
            'Chaucer’s Troylus. The original phrasing was ‘set upon six and '
            'seven’. It referred to betting one’s entire fortune on one throw '
            'of the dice [this, it transpires, being a game called ‘hazard’, '
            'more commonly known as craps]. It connoted carelessness, and over '
            'time the phrase came to mean confusion, disorder, and '
            'disagreement.” Apparently a plural form, ‘to leave at sixes and '
            'sevens’, was developed in the 1800s; it was still based on the '
            'same gambling metaphor, but the idiom was now used to signify a '
            'kind of confusion or neglect, rather that pure risk taking.\n'

{'article': 'The premise of The Premise (Disney+) is vague enough to require '
            'an explanation from its creator, BJ Novak, before it begins. This '
            'to-camera introduction gives it an old-fashioned feel – which is '
            'jarring, because it sets itself up as a very modern show. The '
            'trailer calls it “an anthology of now”, although that only '
            'muddies the waters. Essentially, it is a short comedy-drama '
            'series. Each episode has a discrete cast and a discrete story '
            'that takes a modern concern and forms it into a plot. It feels '
            'like an exercise in creative writing – an ambitious idea more '
            'than the successful execution of an ambitious idea. And, on the '
            'basis of the opening double bill, it doesn’t quite land. The '
            'first episode, Social Justice Sex Tape – how’s that for a '
            'hot-button title? – combines pornography, cancel culture, '
            'institutional racism and police brutality into an absurd legal '
            'comedy farce. Ben Platt stars as Ethan, a “woke bro” type who '
            'lives in a gentrifying area, goes on marches, donates money to '
            'charity and vociferously tweets support for various anti-racism '
            'causes. While masturbating to a sex tape he made with an '
            'ex-girlfriend, he realises that he has captured evidence in the '
            'background that exonerates an innocent black man, Darren '
            'Williams, who is in prison awaiting trial.\n'
            'Ever the ally, Ethan takes the tape to the lawyers defending '
            'Darren and agrees to let them show it in court, to prove that the '
            'police who arrested him are lying. If there is any sense of '
            'realism to start with, it is rapidly tossed aside, showing the '
            'video in full, graphic detail in the lawyers’ office and in '
            'court, without sparing anyone’s blushes by blurring or cropping '
            'out inessential parts. Here, the episode starts to founder and '
            'grab at straws, in trying to find the premise. One solid line of '
            'inquiry is the futility, or not, of online sloganeering; among '
            'the few moments that elicited a laugh was the state lawyer '
            'trawling through Ethan’s Twitter history, pointing out that he '
            'called for the police to be abolished in one tweet and for more '
            'law enforcement at a Tame Impala concert in another. But this is '
            'a cheap joke. Other themes are thrown up with little thought '
            'about where they will land. Ethan’s credibility as a witness is '
            'corroded with various accusations that his sex tape is a deep '
            'fake, that he is a crisis actor or an “incel”, or perhaps all of '
            'the above. The tape becomes about Ethan, his unique sexual style '
            'and whether or not he expected his life to be torn apart for '
            'coming forward with what he saw as evidence. It becomes more '
            'muddled as the farce stacks up. Is it about cancel culture or '
            'social justice? Privacy or activism? It seems coy about going too '
            'far while pushing a silly story to a chaotic conclusion. The '
            'second episode, Moment of Silence, is of more questionable taste. '
            'Jon Bernthal plays the grieving father of a five-year-old girl '
            'killed during a school shooting. He pursues a job doing PR for a '
            'prominent gun lobby, here called the NGL. Again, any notion of '
            'realism is thrown out as soon as the what-if-this-happened twist '
            'becomes clear. The organisation is thrilled with the coup of '
            'getting him on staff and asks him to observe a minute’s silence '
            'for the anniversary of the shooting, which will be broadcast to '
            'the country. It will, they promise, have a big impact. What could '
            'possibly go wrong? The episode is a slow build towards a bleak '
            'resolution and is as sombre and grim as the first episode was '
            'ridiculous. Social Justice Sex Tape took an idea and had fun with '
            'it, but there is clearly no fun to be had in this. Instead, it '
            'settles for a self-satisfied told-you-so. It is unpleasant '
            'viewing for all sorts of reasons; it left me feeling grubby, '
            'rather than educated or provoked. Novak is an accomplished writer '
            'and actor, best known for the US version of The Office, but The '
            'Premise seems to take novel ideas and flatten them out. There are '
            'five episodes, with the final three examining trolling, celebrity '
            'worship and redemption, tied to the development of a butt plug. '
            'There is clearly ambition behind the first two episodes, but the '
            'later premises sound much more appealing – and like a far happier '
            'match between subject matter and tone.',

{'article': 'Either Eddie Jones has walked under a whole row of ladders or his '
            'England selection plans are falling victim to some other mystery '
            'curse. How else to account for the latest injury flurry which has '
            'removed a raft of backline options from contention before this '
            'weekend’s game with Tonga, a fixture earmarked as a springboard '
            'to another potentially exciting new Twickenham era? In theory '
            'this was meant to be among the more upbeat weeks of Jones’s '
            'tenure, with some promising youngsters being expertly blended '
            'into a team with a licence to sparkle like a Bonfire Night '
            'firework show. Instead, having jettisoned plenty of familiar '
            'faces for players such as Marcus Smith, Freddie Steward, Raffi '
            'Quirke and Louis Lynagh, several of the fresh-faced pretenders '
            'are struggling to make it out of the treatment room.\n'
            'The aforementioned quartet plus Saracens’ in-form Max Malins are '
            'all now either doubtful or non-starters for England’s opening '
            'autumn Test, undermining Jones’s efforts to assemble a go-faster '
            'three-quarter line before the Wallabies and the Springboks come '
            'to town. With Quirke, Malins and Lynagh definitely out because of '
            'injuries which originated at their clubs and Smith and Steward as '
            'yet unable to train fully this week, the “new England” could end '
            'up looking remarkably like the old one. If Smith cannot start, in '
            'particular, several rainforests-worth of previews will need '
            'recasting. The primary aim from this fixture, from England’s '
            'perspective, was to see how effectively the Harlequin could '
            'dovetail with Owen Farrell at 10 and 12. As it transpires, with '
            'Quirke also sidelined, the old firm of Farrell and Ben Youngs '
            'could be back, albeit with Northampton’s uncapped Alex Mitchell '
            'on the bench. A penny for the thoughts of George Ford and Dan '
            'Robson, both of whom might have been suited to this fixture. In '
            'certain respects, though, Jones deserves limited sympathy, his '
            'indecision still apparently final. Already he is in the position '
            'of having to talk up Jamie George after brutally jettisoning the '
            'Saracens hooker only last month. Now George has been retained in '
            'his matchday squad ahead of Leicester’s Nic Dolly, who was '
            'originally picked in front of him. If George is currently '
            'wondering which way is up, he is not alone.\n'
            'There would be even less logic if George now starts and '
            'Newcastle’s Jamie Blamire, another original pick, sits on the '
            'bench. And what about Sam Simmonds, good enough to make the '
            'summer Lions tour but also now sent back to his club before the '
            'Tonga game along with Newcastle’s Callum Chick and Leicester’s '
            'George Martin? Rumours persist, meanwhile, that Courtney Lawes '
            'will wear 6 and Tom Curry operate at 8 at certain times this '
            'autumn. If so, and the in-form Alex Dombrandt is “only” warming '
            'the bench against the Tongans, when will the Harlequins No 8 ever '
            'be wholly trusted?\n'
            'Round and round it continues to swirl. Is it actually more '
            'experimentation that England need or more far-sighted judgment, a '
            'better balance and greater stability? It is all very well Jones '
            'deciding Billy Vunipola may not make the 2023 World Cup, when he '
            'will be almost 31, but where does that leave Manu Tuilagi and '
            'Youngs who will be 32 and 34 respectively? Ma’a Nonu was 33 when '
            'he carved up the 2015 World Cup final but what if Tuilagi cannot '
            'regain full throttle this autumn? It is remarkable to think, '
            'either way, that Jones has chosen 20 different centre pairings in '
            'his 66 Tests in charge and started his optimum pair together in '
            'just five of them. Between them Tuilagi and Henry Slade have '
            'pretty much everything a coach could wish for: power, a '
            'gainline-breaking threat, a sweet left boot and a nice outside '
            'break.\n'
            'Think back to the spectacular 32-20 win over Ireland in Dublin in '
            'the 2019 Six Nations, the 40-16 obliteration of Australia in the '
            'World Cup quarter-final in Oita and even when England stormed to '
            'a dramatic 31-0 lead versus Scotland in that dramatic 38-38 '
            'Calcutta Cup draw at Twickenham in 2019. The common denominator, '
            'every time, was a Tuilagi-Slade midfield combo. So if Smith’s '
            '“minor leg injury” forces him either to the bench or out of the '
            '23 entirely, the silver lining could see Farrell lining up in his '
            'best position on his 100th Test appearance and everyone else '
            'finally being able to gauge whether England’s issues stemmed more '
            'from how they were previously being told to play than the '
            'personnel involved. With Adam Radwan and Jonny May on the wings '
            'there should still be oodles of pace and opportunity could also '
            'yet knock for George Furbank. Fitness permitting, naturally.',

{'article': 'Seven charities working to provide food, water, blankets and '
            'other essential aid to refugees in northern France have warned '
            'that they might have to stop their work because celebrity-backed '
            'funder Choose Love is ending its financial support. The charities '
            'provide a lifeline to refugees who are hoping to seek sanctuary '
            'in the UK, often attempting Channel crossings by small boats. The '
            'deteriorating weather as winter approaches makes living '
            'conditions for the estimated 2,000 migrants in Calais, who are '
            'destitute and often forced to sleep outside, more precarious.\n'
            'In a statement the charities said: “We may no longer be able to '
            'continue our work after December. If we were to leave Calais '
            'there would be dangerous gaps left in the provision of basic '
            'warmth, shelter and food.” Choose Love has raised £35m, works in '
            '22 countries to support refugees and has supported 300 projects. '
            'It is backed by celebrities from the worlds of music, fashion and '
            'acting including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Harry Styles, Dua '
            'Lipa, Olivia Colman and Stella McCartney. The charities affected '
            'include Calais Food Collective, Refugee Info Bus and Refugee '
            'Women’s Centre. Between them, the seven aid groups provide food '
            'people can cook themselves, prepared meals, water, firewood, dry '
            'clothing and footwear, blankets, tarpaulins, phone charging '
            'points and information services. Choose Love started in the '
            'summer of 2015 in response to the worsening situation for '
            'refugees in Europe, when a group of volunteers planned to take a '
            'van full of donations and raise £1,000 for refugees in Calais. It '
            'became almost overnight the largest aid operation in northern '
            'France. In a statement issued on Instagram on Tuesday 2 November '
            'Choose Love announced that they would no longer be funding many '
            'of the smaller NGOs working on the frontline with refugees in '
            'Calais and Dunkirk. They will, however, continue to support two '
            'charities working with unaccompanied minors in the area – Safe '
            'Passage and ECPAT. Choose Love said: “This year we find ourselves '
            'in a place where we have had to make some difficult decisions and '
            'we have news which we are delivering with heavy hearts.” It said '
            'it had initiated a strategic review and that many factors, '
            'including the pandemic, were behind the decision to withdraw '
            'funds. The seven charities which will no longer receive funds '
            'from Choose Love say that between them they are losing hundreds '
            'of thousands of pounds and that for some of them their entire '
            'income will be affected.\n'
            'A spokesperson for Refugee Info Bus said: “Funding from Choose '
            'Love supported our vital services and filled a major gap left by '
            'governments and large NGOs. Their withdrawal is a serious blow '
            'which will have real consequences in Calais. A working phone is a '
            'lifeline here. Our teams are established and accepted within the '
            'communities in Calais but the funding situation poses a real '
            'risk. Last week Info Bus helped more than 500 people charge their '
            'phones and access the internet. The dire humanitarian situation '
            'in Calais continues and with the harsh winter approaching we are '
            'urgently seeking alternative funds.” A spokesperson for Calais '
            'Food Collective said: “We will be greatly affected by the '
            'withdrawal of support from Choose Love. It is vitally important '
            'that our essential services are not scaled back – a permanent '
            'water supply for those who have no other water source, food and '
            'cooking equipment are invaluable to those in a state of near '
            'permanent precarity.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “People '
            'should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. It is '
            'dangerous to encourage these Channel crossings, which are '
            'illegal, unnecessary and facilitated by violent criminal gangs '
            'profiting from misery. We are working with the French to stop '
            'boats leaving their beaches and crack down on the criminals '

{'article': 'Prof Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney has won the prime '
            'minister’s prize for science, for his “transformative role in the '
            'scientific response to Covid-19”. Holmes, an expert on the '
            'evolution of viral diseases, publicly shared the genome sequence '
            'of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the first time in January last year, '
            'publishing it on behalf of a consortium of Chinese scientists. '
            'For nearly three decades Holmes has studied how viruses evolve '
            'and jump between species. His research has focused on pathogens '
            'including HIV, Ebola and Zika, and his work on the emergence and '
            'origins of Covid-19 earned him recognition in 2020 as the New '
            'South Wales scientist of the year. Holmes described the '
            'recognition as a “truly humbling experience”.\n'
            'Among the other research achievements honoured in Wednesday’s '
            'awards were the development of biomaterials to repair wounds, '
            'decoding mysterious signals in the distant universe, and '
            'treatments to improve the survival of breast cancer patients. The '
            'prizes, in their 22nd year, are Australia’s most prestigious '
            'awards for achievements in scientific research, innovation and '
            'teaching. Prof Anthony Weiss, also of the University of Sydney, '
            'won the prime minister’s prize for innovation, for developing '
            'biomaterials that can accelerate and improve wound healing in '
            'human tissue. Both he and Holmes were awarded $250,000.\n'
            'Weiss was recognised for creating a synthetic version of '
            'tropoelastin, a protein building block that gives human tissue – '
            'including the skin, arteries and lungs – its elasticity. “Each of '
            'these little bricks is only 20 nanometers in size,” Weiss said. '
            '“We’ve learned how to assemble them into fibres and sheets and '
            'tubes.” The tropoelastin is used in injectables for localised '
            'tissue damage, or as implants in larger wounds, to help speed up '
            'tissue repair after injury. The biomaterial is produced at scale '
            'by specially programmed bacteria. “We just basically crack open '
            'the bacterial cells and out pops out our tropoelastin,” Weiss '
            'said. Weiss founded the firm Elastogen in 2008 to commercialise '
            'the research. The company was sold to one of the world’s biggest '
            'biopharmaceutical firms in 2018, in a deal totalling $334m – one '
            'of the largest transactions in Australia’s life science sector. '
            'Astronomer Dr Keith Bannister, of the CSIRO, was awarded the '
            'Malcolm McIntosh prize for physical scientist of the year. '
            'Bannister designed a way of pinpointing where fast radio bursts '
            '(FRBs) – short pulses of radio waves – originate from in galaxies '
            'billions of light years away.\n'
            'Bannister said it was gratifying to be recognised, emphasising '
            'that the work was a “huge effort” by a team of scientists. He '
            'compared detecting an FRB to “finding a needle in a haystack the '
            'size of 50 football fields”. “When we find one, within half a '
            'second we can actually reach inside the telescope and do a '
            'live-action replay [which helps locate it],” Bannister said. What '
            'exactly produces FRBs is still a mystery of modern astronomy, '
            'with some speculating the signals from deep space could be a sign '
            'of alien life. Bannister is sceptical of this explanation, but '
            'said the energy released by an FRB in one millisecond was '
            'equivalent to what the sun released in 70 years. He encouraged '
            'young people “to think about the Stem disciplines as a career, '
            'and also a way of being creative and a way of making a difference '
            'to the world”. Prof Sherene Loi, an oncologist and researcher at '
            'the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, took home the Frank Fenner '

{'article': 'Confront previous inconvenience and own the narrative. It is a '
            'staple PR play. And how Tottenham pushed it on Tuesday as they '
            'trumpeted the arrival of Antonio Conte as their new head coach. '
            'The inconvenience lay in how Conte had turned them down on 4 '
            'June. At that point Spurs were 46 days into the search for a '
            'permanent successor to José Mourinho and, as we know, it would '
            'take 72 before they plumped for Nuno Espírito Santo – who had '
            'been out of work for the previous 37.\n'
            'Nuno always felt like an uneasy fit, an appointment that failed '
            'to quicken the pulses of the supporters and he departed on Monday '
            'having virtually stopped them. On 2 June, the Spurs chairman, '
            'Daniel Levy, had opened talks with Conte, who had left '
            'Internazionale seven days earlier. Very quickly, there was a '
            'confidence on the Spurs side that a deal could be struck – but '
            'then, within 48 hours, it was all off. There was a blame game, '
            'with Tottenham letting it be known they were concerned about '
            'Conte’s demands for a budget to reshape the squad – and one that '
            'did not factor in the sale of Harry Kane which, in fairness, Levy '
            'was not considering, either. The club also indicated they were '
            'worried as to whether Conte would commit to blooding young '
            'players, giving opportunities to players such as Oliver Skipp and '
            'Ryan Sessegnon. Nuno started Skipp in eight of his 10 Premier '
            'League games. Sessegnon has mainly been injured this season. How '
            'did Conte feel about the framing of events? He was not happy, to '
            'put it bluntly, even if there was an acknowledgment on his side '
            'of Spurs’ need to project a version that defended them. Conte '
            'knows as well as anybody how cynical this business can be. Which '
            'is why it was difficult not to smile when Conte was quoted on '
            'Spurs’ official channels explaining his decision to come this '
            'time. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my '
            'relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too '
            'involved with the end of the season – so I felt that it wasn’t '
            'yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious '
            'enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust '
            'me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the '
            'opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great '
            'conviction.”\n'
            'It is easy to wonder what has changed for Conte, assuming he '
            'still believes the Spurs squad needs surgery and it would not be '
            'performed cheaply. Emerson Royal, Cristian Romero and Bryan Gil '
            'were signed in July and August – representing steps in the right '
            'direction – but, on the down side, the group still looks thin in '
            'areas and the January transfer window is a distance away. It is '
            'never ideal for a manager to take over mid‑season, which is why '
            'Conte has not done so since 2007‑08, with Bari, and this Spurs '
            'team are at a horribly low ebb, with five defeats in the league '
            'already. The more pertinent question concerns what has changed '
            'for Levy and the answer lies in the toxicity of the mood around '
            'Tottenham’s stadium on Saturday during and after the 3-0 defeat '
            'against Manchester United. It has been a catalogue of disaster '
            'for Levy since December, taking in the slump under Mourinho, '
            'which led to his sacking six days before the Carabao Cup final; '
            'the rush to join the doomed European Super League; the exit '
            'strategy of Kane (albeit one that was thwarted); and the botched '
            'hire of Nuno. Levy has never had a tougher time in terms of his '
            'relationship with the fans and as he plotted his move after the '
            'United debacle he knew he needed something big. Something like, '
            'say, appointing the best out-of-work manager in the European '
            'game. He came to feel this was the only move to appease the '
            'masses and, with it, there have been concessions, the kind Levy '
            'has been reluctant to make in the past, to do with control over '
            'transfer business. Pressed into a corner, Levy has had to make '
            'certain promises to Conte.\n'
            'It is traditional at times such as these to talk about war chests '
            'but what Levy has said to Conte is that he will always back him '
            'for the right player. Which sounds promising or a little too open '
            'to interpretation, depending on your view. As ever, sales will be '
            'vital and much will hinge on the work of Fabio Paratici, whom '
            'Spurs announced on 12 June as their managing director of '
            'football, with effect from 1 July. Conte worked productively with '
            'Paratici at Juventus from 2011 to 2014, winning the Serie A title '
            'every season, and it is safe to assume the pair spoke in early '
            'June when Levy first moved for Conte. It was widely reported at '
            'the time that Paratici had given his word to Levy that Conte '
            'would join Spurs but perhaps he did not have the working '
            'knowledge of the club back then; the capacity to be able to '
            'reassure Conte. That has changed. Levy has spoken about how Spurs '
            'have been hit hard by the pandemic but as he has taken out loans '
            'to plug financial gaps – including those linked to the '
            'construction of the £1.2bn ground – the broader picture offers '
            'encouragement. According to Deloitte, the club’s most recent '
            'accounts show “matchday and commercial revenue grew to £94.5m (up '
            '16%) and £160.5m (up 20%) respectively, demonstrating the '
            'revenue-generating potential that they have unlocked through the '
            'new stadium”. Full capacity crowds have made projections within '
            'the league’s profit and sustainability rules even better.\n'
            'With Levy, there has long been the sense that each managerial '
            'hire is a reaction to the previous departure, making it hard to '
            'discern a consistent blueprint or, to use the buzz phrase, a club '
            'DNA. He has bounced from Glenn Hoddle to David Pleat to Jacques '
            'Santini; from Juande Ramos to Harry Redknapp to André '
            'Villas-Boas; from Mauricio Pochettino to Mourinho. What Conte '
            'promises to bring, however, chimes with what Levy and every Spurs '
            'fan wants: quick, hard-running football; intelligent, '
            'well‑drilled patterns; the remorseless will to win. It would '
            'surely have been preferable for Levy to have secured Conte in '
            'June. The pair intend to retrieve the lost time.',

{'article': 'Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker III brought up the most '
            'unpleasant NFL numbers possible after a nasty 44-6 loss on '
            'Sunday: “We have to fix it now, because obviously, it ain’t going '
            'to fix itself, or we’ll be 0-17,” he said after the defeat to the '
            'Philadelphia Eagles. And there it was, for all the world to '
            'ponder: 0-17. No NFL team has gone 0-17, in large part because no '
            'NFL team has played 17 games in a regular season since 1930, when '
            'the late Frankford Yellow Jackets finished 4-13-1, and the New '
            'York Football Giants finished 13-4. But the NFL, always sniffing '
            'more money, expanded the regular season to 17 games from 16 this '
            'year, and the 0-8 Lions, who may not be the worst NFL team but '
            'are now the only winless NFL team, are getting close enough that '
            '0-17 is coming up in conversation. “We’re not going to let them '
            'think like that,” Dan Campbell, their first-year coach, said '
            'Monday.\n'
            'When Campbell, the fiery former tight end and long-time NFL '
            'assistant who led the Miami Dolphins to five victories in 12 '
            'games as interim coach in 2015, took the Lions’ job in January, '
            'he drew some attention (and gasps) by promising, “When you knock '
            'us down, we’re going to get up, and on the way up, we’re going to '
            'bite a kneecap off.” The Lions have done little actual damage '
            'since, though they lost to Baltimore and Minnesota by two points '
            'each. The loss to the Ravens was particularly cruel because '
            'Justin Tucker beat Detroit with a NFL-record 66-yard field goal '
            'as time expired (the Vikings game wasn’t much better: the Lions '
            'lost that one on a last-second Greg Joseph kick).\n'
            'But at least the Lions put themselves in a position to win those '
            'games. The loss to the Eagles, who had been sputtering going into '
            'the game, was so thorough and demoralizing that 0-17 came up, '
            'evoking unpleasant memories. Only two NFL teams went 0-16 in 43 '
            'years: the Cleveland Browns in 2017, and, yep, the Detroit Lions '
            'in 2008. “For us to win, we’ve got to play damn near perfect,” '
            'said Campbell, the former Texas Aggie, “and that’s on us. We’re '
            'charged with that as coaches.” Lions quarterback Jared Goff, the '
            'former No 1 overall draft pick who helped the Los Angeles Rams to '
            'the Super Bowl just three years ago before a drop in production, '
            'said, grimly, “Until we change our habits and until we change who '
            'we are, nothing will change.” Any run to an 0-for-the-season '
            'attracts rubberneckers, but the Lions are especially compelling '
            'because (a) it’s not too long since their last winless season, '
            'and (b) they are a big-market team that has been owned by the '
            'Ford family, the automakers, for nearly 60 years. They have won '
            'exactly one playoff game in that timespan. Indeed, the Lions’ '
            'Wikipedia history page has been edited to include the following: '
            '“In the current millennia (sic), the Detroit Lions record of '
            'franchise mediocrity has been solidified through the continuing '
            'incompetent ownership of the Ford family.” This has been a superb '
            'college football season in the state, with Michigan State '
            'rallying to beat Michigan on Saturday in a battle of unbeaten '
            'top-10 rivals. Even with the Lions facing an opponent some people '
            'thought they could beat, the paid attendance at Ford Field a day '
            'later 85 miles away was 47,192, nearly 18,000 short of capacity. '
            '“Winning solves a lot of issues, as you all know,” Campbell said. '
            'But the Lions have not won much for decades. They have lost all '
            'eight of their playoff games since 1991, when they fell apart in '
            'the second half against Washington in the NFC championship game. '
            'That was as close as the Lions have come to the Super Bowl. In '
            'fact, the Lions are one of just four NFL teams that have never '
            'played in a Super Bowl. And Jacksonville, Cleveland and Houston – '
            'the three others – have been around far less time than the Lions, '
            'who were established in 1928 as the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans. '
            'The Lions won the 1935 NFL championship and three more in their '
            'glory days between 1952 and 1957, but those were football’s dark '
            'ages. Consider that a person born on 29 December 1957, the date '
            'when Detroit won their most recent NFL title, will turn 64 next '
            'month. Campbell is the 21st Lions’ head coach since that day. He '
            'arrived with lower expectations than his immediate non-interim '
            'predecessor, Matt Patricia, a Bill Belichick disciple whose Lions '
            'won 13 of 43 games. Patricia hightailed it back to New England. '
            'The Lions are young, and Campbell has kept his expectations in '
            'check. Still, as he said during a news conference Monday: “Look. '
            'We’re in the middle of a lot of adversity now. We knew it was '
            'going to come. But I don’t think any of us thought it was going '
            'to be 0-8.” They won’t lose this weekend, because they have a '
            'bye, and Campbell is planning to use the time to do a little more '
            '“self-scouting,” as coaches like to call it, to look at more tape '
            'and identify the problems. A lack of effort apparently is not one '
            'of them. “It’s a lack of focus, details, fundamentals – and '
            'sometimes, a lack of attitude, if you will,” Campbell said, '
            'referring to his team’s tendency to take a while to reach a full '
            'boil. A Detroit Tigers’ cap pulled low on his head, Campbell was '
            'blunt but calm. When he was told what Walker had said about '
            'possibly going 0-17, Campbell pointed out that the Lions still '
            'have nine games left, including a Thanksgiving Day home game '
            'against the struggling Chicago Bears. The New York Jets lost '
            'their first 13 games last year to stoke a lot of 0-16 chatter '
            'until, to the dismay of their fans, they won two games in a row '
            'to surpass Jacksonville, who won their opener and then lost their '
            'last 15 games. The Jaguars used the No 1 pick on Trevor Lawrence. '
            'The Lions already have a No 1 pick at quarterback, plus three '
            'draft picks acquired in the trade that sent their talented '
            'quarterback Matt Stafford to the Rams, who are 7-1. A turnaround '
            'may take a while, maybe even into 2022, but Campbell said one is '
            'coming. “I know we’re not the team that played yesterday,” he '
            'said Monday, even though the Lions were that very team.',

{'article': 'Lawyers for the resources minister have conceded the Morrison '
            'government’s “regrettable” conduct in a federal court case denied '
            'environmentalists the opportunity to prevent the Coalition from '
            'signing contracts to pay Empire Energy $21m to frack the Beetaloo '
            'Basin. The federal court is currently hearing a case lodged by '
            'the Environment Centre NT challenging a grants program designed '
            'to accelerate fracking in the Northern Territory as part of the '
            'government’s gas-led recovery. The $50m program has already '
            'awarded almost half its funds to a single company, Empire, which '
            'is seeking to drill three exploratory wells in the basin. The '
            'central allegation in the case is that the grants were not lawful '
            'because the resources minister, Keith Pitt, failed to properly '
            'consider the risk to global heating posed by opening up the '
            'region to fracking. Earlier this year, as lawyers on both sides '
            'prepared for the current hearing, government solicitors wrote to '
            'the Environment Centre NT and promised it had no imminent plans '
            'to sign contracts with Empire. But, without any notice, it did '
            'precisely that in September.\n'
            'The court heard the government’s actions effectively denied the '
            'opportunity for the Environment Centre NT and others to seek an '
            'order from the court to prevent the signing of such agreements '
            'until the case was resolved. The government’s actions sparked a '
            'furious response from the federal court, where justice John '
            'Griffiths said they were “unfortunate and not reflecting well on '
            'the minister”. The issue reared its head again on Wednesday. The '
            'Environment Centre NT and other applicants now allege the '
            'government signed the contracts in “order to stymy the '
            'applicants’ claim in this litigation”. They argue the government '
            'wanted to lock the contracts in before the court had the '
            'opportunity to determine whether the grants and the grant scheme '
            'were lawful. Tom Howe QC, representing the minister, agreed the '
            'government had failed in its duty to act as a model litigant. '
            'Howe agreed the government’s actions had denied those mounting '
            'the challenge the opportunity to seek interlocutory relief to '
            'prevent the contracts from being signed until the case was '
            'finalised. “What happened should not have happened. What the '
            'commonwealth should have done when the opportunity to enter the '
            'contracts was brought forward was to write to the applicant and '
            'give them notice, reasonable notice of that so that they could '
            'make an application for interlocutory relief,” he said. “That '
            'should have happened and it didn’t and that was quite regrettable '
            'conduct that involved a departure from model litigant standards.” '
            'But Howe denied, in strong terms, that the government had signed '
            'the contracts with the intention of thwarting the case or the '
            'applicants. “Your honour knows that very often, when conspiracy '
            'or malice is alleged, that it can often be truly explained on the '
            'basis of error,” Howe said. “Sometimes error of a serious kind, '
            'but not of a kind that involves intended wrongdoing.” Howe also '
            'criticised the fact that the allegation had only been levelled at '
            'the government late on Friday. “It is a most serious allegation '
            'to raise. It’s a serious allegation to raise very late in the '
            'day, for the first time after the close of evidence and only in '
            'submissions in reply.” But the judge said the commonwealth was '
            'guilty of the same failing, having only notified the applicants '
            'of a key part of its argument and relevant case law on Sunday. '
            'The hearing concluded on Wednesday. Griffiths has reserved his '
            'decision.',

{'article': 'A doctor who was director of obstetrics and gynaecology at a '
            'Victorian hospital during a cluster of baby deaths has been '
            'effectively banned from practising medicine again. However, the '
            'disciplinary action has come years after he already retired. Dr '
            'Surinder Parhar has not practised medicine since October 2015, '
            'after an investigation into a tragic cluster of newborn and '
            'stillborn deaths at the Bacchus Marsh hospital. He worked at the '
            'hospital for 30 years. The Victorian Civil and Administrative '
            'Tribunal made nine findings of professional misconduct against '
            'Parhar, banning him from practising for another 12 years. While '
            'it was not alleged Parhar directly caused any of the deaths, the '
            'tribunal found in its decision published on Wednesday that he '
            '“failed to recognise that what was happening needed to be '
            'addressed, and that he had individual responsibility to do '
            'something”.\n'
            'The case concerned Parhar’s actions related to 27 maternity '
            'patients at the hospital between 2008 and 2015. Twenty-one of '
            'those patients experienced stillbirth or death of their baby '
            'shortly after birth, while others experienced various adverse '
            'events, a rate much higher than what would be expected for a '
            'hospital of the size of Bacchus Marsh. “As a low-risk birthing '
            'facility, the number of adverse outcomes over a short period of '
            'time should have led to ‘alarm bells ringing’ but did not,” the '
            'tribunal found. “Little action was taken to identify the causes '
            'of the adverse outcomes or implement changes in practice. The '
            'failures in practice were not identified and continued for a '
            'significant period of time putting more patients at risk.” The '
            'tribunal found deficiencies in Parhar’s direct clinical care of '
            'one patient after he failed to recognise her symptoms were the '
            'result of the death of her baby. He also failed to ensure there '
            'were adequate clinical reviews of 19 perinatal deaths; to ensure '
            'there was adequate open disclosure with patients in relation to '
            '15 perinatal deaths; to ensure necessary policies were in place '
            'to improve patient safety; to provide adequate supervision of '
            'three junior doctors; to improve or maintain his own professional '
            'performance; or to keep proper records. Parhar admitted to all of '
            'the allegations. “He is highly remorseful – he is sorry for '
            'himself and his role in this ‘sad story’ but also sorry for the '
            'impact on the parents and the community,” the decision said. “He '
            'recognises that his career has ended in shame and ignominy. Much '
            'of what has been identified is very much ‘with the benefit of '
            'hindsight’.” The tribunal decision said Parhar was not the only '
            'staff member to fail patients, noting “an almost systemic '
            'complacency and misguided self-congratulation about the quality '
            'of the maternity service”.\n'
            'Other cases involving former hospital staff at the time are due '
            'to come before the tribunal. But the tribunal found there had '
            'been “years of missed opportunities to recognise and acknowledge '
            'what was going wrong, and act to prevent future avoidable deaths '
            'and adverse patient outcomes”. “Parhar was not the only senior '
            'health practitioner … to be blind to the pattern emerging and to '
            'fail to recognise that alarm bells should have been ringing,” the '
            'decision said. “Nevertheless, he occupied a significant '
            'leadership role as the director of obstetrics, although he did '
            'not apparently recognise that; and he had undoubted '
            'responsibilities as a medical practitioner and senior '
            'obstetrician, which he did not properly discharge.” The tribunal '
            'acknowledged that its decision to ban Parhar from practising '
            'medicine for 12 years would have little practical impact on his '
            'career given he was already retired. “But it sends a clear '
            'message to those who may still expect to have years of medical '
            'practice before them that, if they engage in similar conduct, '
            'their time as a doctor is likely to end well before their planned '
            'retirement,” the decision said. In 2015, the Australian Health '
            'Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) apologised for the length '
            'of the investigation into the health service, after first '
            'receiving a complaint in 2013 about the care a different doctor '
            'provided to a mother after a stillbirth. Ahpra has investigated '
            '43 health practitioners who then worked at Bacchus Marsh '
            'hospital. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '
            'Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'On Wednesday Ahpra chief executive, Martin Fletcher, said this '
            'tribunal decision was a strong outcome in response to “tragic and '
            'sad events”. “It is important to hold accountable practitioners '
            'in leadership roles who have clear responsibilities for patient '
            'safety and who fail to act,” he said. The case against Parhar was '
            'brought by the Medical Board of Australia. The board’s chair, Dr '
            'Anne Tonkin, described the failures of the hospital as “tragic”. '
            '“While we recognise this decision may be of little comfort for '
            'the families who so sadly lost their babies, it highlights the '
            'importance of registered medical practitioners, especially those '
            'in senior positions, understanding and acting on their '
            'responsibilities to ensure safe patient care,” she said.',

{'article': 'Helen Oyeyemi is a bamboozler, a discombobulator, a peddler of '
            'perplexity. She crushes fables and fairytales down to a powder '
            'and then laces her fiction with it like some kind of literary '
            'hallucinogen. Her novels should come with pharmaceutical warning '
            'labels: do not operate heavy machinery under the influence. '
            'Symptoms may include slurred realism and a persistent allegorical '
            'itch. In her most recent books, the British author seems to have '
            'been experimenting with how much expository and explanatory '
            'weight she can jettison to make space for filigree and romp. In '
            '2019’s Gingerbread, the result was something akin to immersive '
            'theatre – an invitation to explore. What we lost in orientation, '
            'we gained in play space. Gingerbread could be read as a novel '
            'about Brexit insularity, the tenacious forces of social '
            'immobility, or just a high fantasia about stupendous biscuitry. '
            'Oyeyemi’s seventh novel, Peaces, is set on a train, a chimerical '
            'engine so scaled and silvered it seems almost creaturely. Inside '
            'its carriages, the laws of physics don’t quite apply; the air '
            'crackles with ontological doubt (“If you stuck out your tongue it '
            'would dance there, right at the tip: the fizz of '
            'conditionality”). Trains provide a “sticky mix of enclosure and '
            'exposure”, Oyeyemi writes; an “incubator for intense encounters”. '
            'This one – The Lucky Day – comes replete with a postal sorting '
            'office, portrait gallery, sauna and holding cell. Not to mention '
            'a glass-panelled greenhouse car. And that’s what Oyeyemi has '
            'built here: a hurtling hothouse of a novel. In the wilds of '
            '“deepest Kent” we join Otto and Xavier Shin – a mesmerist and his '
            'ghostwriter lover – as they embark on their “non-honeymoon '
            'honeymoon”. The trip is a gift from a wealthy insomniac aunt '
            '(“she looks so tired nobody realises she’s rich”), and they are '
            'accompanied – as always – by Árpád, Otto’s companion mongoose, '
            '30th in a distinguished line of companion mongooses stretching '
            'back two centuries (mongooses should travel before they hit '
            'middle age, Oyeyemi explains, “otherwise they get '
            'narrow-minded”). Otto and Xavier share The Lucky Day with three '
            'others: a composer-cum-driver, a debt control officer (mystical '
            'trains are expensive), and the train’s owner, theremin virtuoso '
            'Ava Kapoor, who – rumour has it – never disembarks. Is she a '
            'recluse or a captive? When our lovers catch a glimpse of her '
            'through a window, they can’t tell if the sign she’s holding says '
            '“HELLO” or “HELP”. It’s all so drenched in quirk and whimsy – the '
            'leashed mongoose, the theremin, the brocade fainting couch in the '
            'train library that is “the colour of Darjeeling tea in the fourth '
            'minute of brewing” – the stuff of Wes Anderson fever dreams. But, '
            'unlike Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited, the legacy of empire is '
            'wild and wakeful on Oyeyemi’s train, not just elaborate '
            'wallpaper. The Lucky Day was once a tea smuggling train, with '
            'shady connections to the East India company. With old money come '
            'old cruelties. “I’m sure almost no one deludes themselves that '
            'all their ancestors were decent,” Otto reminds us. As The Lucky '
            'Day lurches through a landscape our lovers don’t recognise, '
            'Peaces lurches in and out of time and memory, accumulating '
            'symbols and backstories like clues to a grand whodunnit. What do '
            'a burning house, days-of-the-week boxer shorts, a board game '
            'duel, a handful of emeralds, a contested inheritance and a man in '
            'a peacock-green scuba suit have in common? Why is it that each of '
            'the passengers sees a different image emerge from the '
            'white-on-white paintings in the gallery car? Just as we suspect '
            'Oyeyemi has lost control – as her locomotive careens into Dadaist '
            'chaos – Ava arrives brandishing an envelope bearing the officious '
            'little stamp of the “Agency for Introducing a Sense of Proportion '
            'into Novel Writing”. Whether that missive delights or maddens '
            'will depend entirely on the reader. By the time Oyeyemi’s '
            'wilfully disproportionate train has stopped, a unifying character '
            'has appeared in silhouette: the artist who painted those '
            'shapeshifting canvases. As his connection to our cast is drawn '
            'out, so is a parable of connection, of the ways we shapeshift to '
            'fulfil each other’s desires. Peaces turns the existential terror '
            'of feeling unseen into a corporeal reality. How easy it is to '
            'lose yourself – or erase someone else – with the heat of your own '
            'wanting. To live unseen is a tragedy, but Peaces continues '
            'Oyeyemi’s career-long project of helping us to unsee – unsnarling '
            'the neural knots that childhood fairytales tied in us: those '
            'tales of sovereignty and dominion, of limp princesses and their '
            'flaxen-haired suitors, of snowy purity and moral absolutes. '
            'White-on-white. “Here’s to unseeing the world,” Ava rejoices. '
            'What we lose in orientation in this novel, we gain in a kind of '
            'merciless velocity. It’s hard not to feel like a passenger aboard '
            'this book, a little queasy from watching the narrative blur and '
            'judder. But for all of her twee excesses, there are few writers '
            'who can match Oyeyemi’s creative glee. On a first read, Peaces '
            'works best when you stop trying to solve it, and instead '
            'surrender to that exuberance. Far better to sit back and revel in '
            'this book’s queer sensualities and the sherbet fizz of its wit; '
            'to enjoy the company of platinum-furred, jewel-hoarder Árpád, '
            'lithe as Nijinsky reincarnate; or perhaps try to imagine a melody '
            'that makes a “theremin sound as if it was looking back on a long '
            'life of crime”. Then when it’s over, return – clear-eyed – for a '
            'second trip. • Peaces by Helen Oyeyemi is published by Faber '

{'article': 'Throughout the 2021 United Nations climate change conference, the '
            'Guardian will be publishing the stories of the people whose lives '
            'have been upended – sometimes devastated – by the climate '
            'breakdown. Gennadiy Shukin, Taymyr, Russia I was born in 1962 in '
            'a family of deer herders in Taymyr, on a peninsula in the very '
            'far north of Russia. I am part of the Dolgan community: we are an '
            'indigenous Russian group and there are around 6,000 left of us '
            'living in the tundra. Growing up, the Soviet Union tried to deny '
            'us our traditional way of life, but since then climate change has '
            'become the biggest challenge to our survival. Our community lives '
            'by hunting, fishing and herding deer. Scientists say that Taymyr '
            'has the most rapid temperature increase in Russia, and we can '
            'really feel it. Because of the warmer winters, we have seen that '
            'deer are giving birth earlier in the year. Many are born too weak '
            'and don’t survive the long journeys they have to make. This means '
            'there is much less deer for us to hunt and it hurts the whole '
            'ecosystem. Rivers and lakes that we use for fishing have also '
            'started to dry out. Others are too polluted after all the big oil '
            'and gas plants have sprung up over the years in our lands. Some '
            'days we don’t catch any fish at all. For generations, we have '
            'sold the food we caught to local towns and cities to buy basic '
            'products like sugar and wheat. Without animals, we cannot '
            'survive. Big craters are also forming because the Arctic '
            'permafrost is starting to melt under our feet. This means the '
            'routes that we have used for decades to travel, hunt and fish '
            'have to be adjusted as whole roads have sunk. It is also '
            'dangerous as you never know where the next crater will form. Our '
            'ecosystem is changing quickly: animals such as sables that I have '
            'never seen before in my life have appeared in the tundra. And now '
            'we also have to deal with giant mosquitoes and bugs that attack '
            'our livestock. The summers are becoming unbearable. It’s madness. '
            'The youth sees that climate change makes our traditional way of '
            'life impossible and they are forced to move to the bigger cities '
            'to find jobs, which are often low-paid. Our culture is '

            'Doric, the Scots language as spoken in the north-east of '
            'Scotland, and Northumbrian coastal speech joining Scots Gaelic. '
            'The work, funded by the British Council, is being featured at the '
            'summit in Glasgow on Wednesday by its producers, Philippa Bayley '
            'and Neville Gabie, with partner organisations worldwide. Three '
            'further words, from the Namibian Khwe language, are being '
            'released later this week. Gabie, a visual artist living in '
            'Gloucestershire, said they hoped to promote a shift in thinking '
            'about the climate crisis to focus on humanity’s integration with '
            'and dependency on the natural world. “The conversations in Cop26 '
            'are dominated by a western notion of how we address climate '
            'change,” he said. “We’re trying to say part of the solution is a '
            'change of thinking, which can be inspired by other communities '
            'who have lived with nature in a very different way to our own. '
            '“It’s opening ourselves to those different voices, that different '
            'conversation, and a different dialogue with nature and the '
            'environment that I think is so vital and necessary.”\n'
            'Bayley, a research manager, said indigenous and minority '
            'languages were rooted in their bonds with the surrounding '
            'environment. “Language grows out of a place so the specifics of '
            'that place – the creatures, the plants, the landscape, the '
            'climate – are all represented in the language,” she said. “But '
            'also language describes more deeply the relationships of humans '
            'to the more than human, but also all those other relationships to '
            'each other.” Bayley cites the word tshinanu, from the Innu '
            'language Nehluen spoken in the Quebec province of Canada that '
            'means an all-inclusive “we – all as equals”. “We’re very much '
            'driving the [Cop26] negotiations from a point of fear, ‘If we '
            'don’t do this, we’re all screwed’. As if we need to feel the heat '
            'turning up, the pressure increasing, in order for us to take '
            'action,” she said. “Our project is aiming to say it’s all about '
            'relationships. From a sense we belong in nature, and that it’s '
            'not a battle between either we win with our development model, or '
            'nature wins and we have to give up all that stuff. We’re on the '

{'article': 'We booked a last-minute holiday to Malta in August and checked '
            'post-Brexit entry requirements on the government website. It '
            'stated that passports need to be valid for at least three months '
            'after the day you planned to leave Malta, or any other Schengen '
            'country. I had five and a half months left on mine. However, when '
            'I tried to check in for our Ryanair flight, the airline told me '
            'travellers must have at least six months left on their passports '
            'in order to fly, and that we would be denied boarding. We '
            'therefore lost the £1,200 we’d paid for the holiday, and spent '
            'another £1,600 on an alternative week in Cornwall. I can’t be the '
            'only person caught out by this confusion about the rules. MF, '
            'Ipswich, Suffolk Indeed, you are not, and the fault lies, in '
            'part, with the Home Office. For nine months it published '
            'misleading information about post-Brexit passport requirements to '
            'Schengen countries. The guidance on the HM Passport Office '
            'website, published in October last year, stated that at least six '
            'months must be left on a passport for travel to most European '
            'countries. At the end of July, the government amended the '
            'guidance after reports of holidaymakers who had been denied '
            'boarding by airlines because of the error. The website now '
            'confirms the three-month rule and merely recommends that '
            'passports have six months of validity. Since you were due to fly '
            'in mid-August, Ryanair should have been aware of the rules and of '
            'the government correction. It had no business refusing to fly '
            'you. Not that the airline is admitting any fault. “Ryanair '
            'complies with all European Commission travel regulations and '
            'passengers travelling between the EU and the UK after the end of '
            'the transition period must have a passport that is not valid for '
            'more than 10 years,” it says, completely missing the point. EU '
            'requirements do state that passports cannot be valid for more '
            'than 10 years (some older UK ones are) but since your passport '
            'reaches its 10th anniversary next February that is irrelevant. I '
            'pointed this out to Ryanair, but was met with resounding silence. '
            'The Home Office also focuses on the irrelevant 10-year rule to '
            'save face. Not only does it decline to apologise for misleading '
            'travellers, it claims its erroneous advice was doing travellers a '
            'favour. “To avoid the possibility of citizens encountering '
            'difficulties at any particular border when complying with these '
            'rules, our advice continues to show that any extra months added '
            'to a 10-year passport may not count. We make no apology for '
            'taking a risk-averse approach to ensure our citizens do not face '
            'issues at borders.” When I again asked why, if the government '
            'stood by its guidance, it had been quietly rewritten in July, '
            'there was no further response. The good news is that, according '
            'to the specialist aviation solicitor Bott & Co, you can try to '
            'claim compensation from Ryanair and argue you were denied '
            'boarding without reasonable grounds under EC 261/2004 which has, '
            'since Brexit, been enshrined in UK law. The bad news is, the sum '

{'article': 'Josie, 19, landed her first “adult” job as an IT support worker '
            'last November, just a few months after graduating from high '
            'school. Though the job could be done fully remotely, managers '
            'insisted that she come into the office – despite the pandemic. At '
            'first, her co-workers and managers wore masks, but often '
            'incorrectly; when the local mask mandate was lifted, people '
            'stopped wearing them altogether. “It was honestly scary,” Josie '
            'recalls. She’d just moved into her first apartment with her '
            'partner; both have pre-existing health conditions that increase '
            'their vulnerability to severe illness from Covid-19. But as the '
            'sole earner in her two-person household, Josie felt resigned to '
            'the daily risk at work.\n'
            '“It was like getting shot out of a cannon into adulthood,” she '
            'says. This August amid the rise of the Delta variant, she finally '
            'quit – becoming one of the 4.3 million American workers to '
            'voluntarily leave their jobs during that month alone. It was a '
            'record-breaking month for resignations since the government began '
            'tracking monthly job turnovers more than two decades ago, '
            'according to labor department data released in mid-October. '
            'Between January and August of this year, at least 30 million '
            'Americans quit their jobs. Whether you call it the “Great '
            'Resignation” or a “nationwide reassessment of work”, the labor '
            'market shake-up of the pandemic could have unexpected aftershocks '
            'for years to come. That may be especially true for early-career '
            'workers like Josie, who have now spent a major chunk of their '
            'working lives under the strain of Covid-19. Many of these workers '
            'say their job experiences in the pandemic have led them to '
            'recognize their real priorities in life – and leaving a job is '
            'perhaps the boldest assertion of those priorities they can make. '
            '‘It gave me this unbelievable sense of freedom’ “I never imagined '
            'it would happen this way, but here I am,” says Alex, a '
            '27-year-old marketing professional who had worked at the same '
            'Boston-based consumer tech startup since she graduated from '
            'college until early October, when she resigned from the company '
            'via email. Pre-pandemic, the company’s culture was relaxed. But '
            'the switch to fully remote work in March 2020 was swiftly '
            'followed by a sharp boom in product sales. Over time, an “always '
            'on” work culture crept in as a result, with co-workers '
            'communicating at all hours. When a colleague left the company, '
            'Alex’s workload doubled with no additional pay. “I just felt like '
            'I couldn’t let things go, because [the company was] really '
            'small,” she says. “If anyone were to leave, it just seemed '
            'impossible.” Alex reached out to teammates for help, only to '
            'discover that they were just as burned out as she was. But '
            'because this was the only job she’d ever had, she didn’t '
            'initially recognize that the extent of her overwork – and her '
            'sense of personal obligation to the business – were not '
            'necessarily normal or healthy. That is, until she talked to '
            'others outside the company. Quitting has been more than a relief. '
            '“It gave me this unbelievable sense of freedom that I could do '
            'whatever I wanted, and made things so much clearer,” says Alex, '
            'speaking from her parents’ home near Washington. She plans to '
            'spend a few months relaxing with family before finding a new job, '
            'possibly in non-profit work. She has also begun revisiting '
            'long-deferred plans to pursue a graduate degree in public '
            'administration – plans that were easy to neglect in the face of '
            'an ever-mounting workload. Like Alex, 28-year-old Cassie also '
            'experienced a pandemic burnout in her role as a case manager for '
            'a life insurance company in central Pennsylvania. A visual artist '
            'by training, Cassie joined the firm in July 2019 after a stint '
            'doing freelance graphic design work. It wasn’t her dream job, but '
            'the stability was a nice change at first. Then in the second half '
            'of 2020, her workload multiplied seemingly overnight. Before '
            'long, Cassie was fielding more work calls than any single person '
            'could handle. Work became so all-consuming that she converted her '
            'home studio space, originally set up for unwinding and making '
            'art, into a makeshift home office. “[The pandemic] turned this '
            'space for good times into work times, and eventually bad times,” '
            'Cassie recalls. While she remains grateful to have had the '
            'ability to work from home in 2020, losing the time and space for '
            'a creative outlet was a blow. A few weeks ago, she opted to leave '
            'the job for good. Thanks to a salaried live-in partner and some '
            'personal savings, she feels fortunate to have a “coasting budget” '
            'to live from while she explores what comes next. She hopes to '
            'find a job that’s both creative and stable. ‘My life is my life '
            'and my job is my job’ For 27-year-old Lloren Zeigler, quitting '
            'was a way to regain control of her time. Leaving her job as a '
            'television production manager, last December, was easy. “They '
            'wanted me to work through the holiday and I said '
            'abso-fucking-lutely not,” says Zeigler. Since walking away from '
            'her entertainment industry role nearly a year ago, the Los '
            'Angeles-based Zeigler has devoted herself full-time to the small '
            'business she began in 2020 with her partner, Liz Sanchez. The '
            'pair make incense that they sell at local swap meets and flea '
            'markets under the brand Le Trois Apothecary. It may or may not '
            'become a forever-job, but Zeigler appreciates the opportunity to '
            'nurture her entrepreneurial streak. Nancy, 30, a PR professional '
            'who also lives in Los Angeles, similarly resigned from her job '
            'for the greener pastures of self-employment. Working remotely '
            'during quarantine, she realized that she didn’t need to rely on a '
            'hovering boss to be productive and do work that she could feel '
            'good about. In October, she left her position at a small '
            'recording company after just three months – her second time '
            'quitting a job during the pandemic. “My job is not my life,” '
            'Nancy says. “My life is my life and my job is my job. I’m willing '
            'to take on the uncertainty [of unemployment] simply to have my '
            'own time under control, and have my own life available to me.” '
            'While Nancy remains open to the possibility of another full-time '
            'role, she says that a prospective employer would need to respect '
            'her boundaries and trust her to manage her own schedule. For the '
            'time being, she plans to pursue freelance music marketing '
            'projects and related project management. Josie, the 19-year-old '
            'in Ohio, is similarly protective of her personal boundaries in a '
            'work setting. Since quitting, she’s found a new job doing similar '
            'work for a different company. This time, however, the position is '
            'fully remote. Though she isn’t sure where her future will lead, '
            'Josie says she now knows what her rights are as a worker. They '
            'include the right to leave a job without remorse. “Companies '
            'don’t care about me, either,” she says.',

{'article': 'Nigel Farage’s Brexit party may have saved up to 25 Labour seats '
            'in the Midlands and the north at the 2019 general election, '
            'denying Boris Johnson a landslide majority of 130, according to '
            'new analysis. Farage’s party failed to win a single seat in '
            'December 2019 as Boris Johnson sought to hammer home the message '
            'that the Conservatives would “get Brexit done”. But elections '
            'experts John Curtice, Stephen Fisher and Patrick English say that '
            'by attracting Leave-supporting former Labour voters who might '
            'otherwise have backed the Conservatives, Farage may have '
            'significantly cut the scale of Labour’s defeat. By modelling the '
            'behaviour of Labour Leavers elsewhere, they suggest that in the '
            'absence of a Brexit party candidate, 70% would likely have turned '
            'to the Tories and 30% stuck with Labour. Meanwhile, Conservative '
            'voters who switched to Farage’s party were likely to have voted '
            'for Johnson. “As a result, the Brexit party may have cost the '
            'Conservatives about 25 of the seats that Labour managed to retain '
            '– most of them Leave-voting seats in the north of England and the '
            'Midlands – and thereby enabled Labour to avoid an even heavier '
            'loss of seats,” they say in a new book, The British General '
            'Election of 2019, published on Tuesday. Labour’s performance was '
            'already its worst in terms of seats won since 1935, prompting '
            'Jeremy Corbyn’s resignation after a chaotic campaign. The Brexit '
            'party stood its most prominent candidate, Richard Tice, in '
            'Labour-held Hartlepool where he took more than 10,000 votes but '
            'came in behind Labour and the Conservatives. The seat fell to the '
            'Tories in a byelection this year, raising questions about Keir '
            'Starmer’s ability to win back the so-called red wall. Farage '
            'repeatedly sought an electoral pact with Johnson’s Conservatives '
            'in 2019, offering to stand aside in Tory-held seats in exchange '
            'for a free run in former Labour heartlands constituencies. With '
            'no deal forthcoming, he unilaterally decided not to field '
            'candidates in seats where there was an incumbent Tory MP. This '
            'move had less of an effect on the UK-wide result, the authors say '
            '– but it did have an impact in a few key seats that the Tories '
            'only narrowly held. “There was just a handful of seats where the '
            'decision of the Brexit party to stand down might have helped '
            'avoid a Conservative defeat, though they include the seats of two '
            'prominent Brexiters, Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford & Wood Green) '
            'and Dominic Raab (Esher & Walton).” The Liberal Democrats are '
            'heavily targeting Raab’s Surrey constituency, which he held by '
            'just 2,700 votes. Edited by academics Tim Bale, Robert Ford, Will '
            'Jennings and Paula Surridge, the new book is the latest edition '
            'of what is widely viewed as the definitive academic guide to '
            'general elections, with the first edition published in the wake '
            'of Labour’s landslide victory in 1945. By analysing '
            'constituency-by-constituency results, and responses to the '
            'British Election Study internet panel, covering 30,000 voters, '
            'Curtice, Fisher and English show that Brexit heavily skewed the '
            'outcome in contests right across the country. “The Conservatives’ '
            'share of the vote increased by nearly six [percentage] points on '
            '2017 in seats that are estimated to have backed Leave most '
            'heavily in 2016, while the party’s vote fell by a couple of '
            'points in constituencies where most had voted Remain,” they say. '
            'By contrast, they add: “While Labour’s vote fell by six points '
            'where most voters had backed Remain, it dropped by nearly nine '
            'points where a majority had supported Leave.” They say this '
            'pattern was “disruptive of much of the existing geography of '
            'party support” so that “all of Britain’s parties often recorded '
            'some of their best performances in relatively unfamiliar '
            'territory” – including the Conservatives’ advances in the North '
            'and Midlands.',

{'article': 'The setting sun brings a warm glow to the huts in the village of '
            'Umoja in Samburu county, Kenya. Christine Sitiyan sits outside '
            'her home with her beadwork, carefully running the thin thread '
            'through tiny bead holes, hoping she can finish the colourful belt '
            'she is making before darkness sets in. The traditional belt can '

            'school but was married off as a young teenager. Seven years '
            'later, with two children, she left her husband, unable to endure '
            'the beatings from a man she says could no longer fend for the '
            'family in an increasingly harsh environment. “He would beat me '
            'almost every evening out of frustration,” says Sitiyan, 25. “The '
            'drought killed part of his family’s livestock, while raiders from '
            'a neighbouring community stole the rest.” He took up manual '
            'labour, earning 300 shillings a day, barely enough to provide for '
            'the family. “One day, I just took off with the children and found '
            'refuge here.” Sitiyan is among scores of women and girls in '
            'Umoja, a village that has become a rescue centre for women and '
            'girls escaping domestic violence, female genital mutilation (FGM) '
            'and early marriages. There are no men in this manyatta, the '
            'traditional homestead.\n'
            'While the women may have escaped these threats, they are still '
            'potential victims of “drought-instigated violence”. Along with '
            'women in other marginalised counties such as Garissa, Marsabit, '
            'Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir and Turkana, they are at great risk of '
            'sexual molestation as they trek long distances in search of '
            'water. John Kitui, country director of Oxfam Kenya, an '
            'organisation that works with local groups helping to build '
            'resilience, says: “As the drought continues, families have '
            'nothing to fall back on and are forced to marry off daughters '
            'early to receive dowry payment. Without school fees, it is often '
            'girls who are forced out of class who then bear children at a '
            'young age. The resulting stress often leads to domestic '
            'violence.” Women are also the unintended victims of tribal '
            'conflicts as communities fight over dwindling resources. Men are '
            'forced to move remaining livestock tens of kilometres away to '
            'find foliage, and the women and children left behind are at '
            'increased risk of attacks by bandits.\n'
            'A 2021 food and water assessment report for Samburu states that '
            'conflicts triggered by “competition for rangeland resources … '
            'have resulted in loss of people’s lives and their livelihoods”, '
            'with local leaders reporting increasing climate-related cases of '
            'domestic violence. Henry Lenayiasa, a chief in Samburu, says '
            'cases of violence against women by men who can no longer eke out '
            'a living in the harsh environment are on the rise. He says '
            'residents may have heard about climate breakdown and how it '
            'affects them, “but men who are unable to cope with the drought '
            'take it out on women”. “We have lost livestock in great numbers '
            'during the drought. In Kenya’s arid north, a man without '
            'livestock cannot provide and loses self-esteem. This is likely to '
            'trigger cases of domestic violence. If we do not address climate '
            'matters adequately, such cases will only escalate,” says '
            'Lenayiasa.\n'
            'Women in these marginalised communities are exposed to risk of '
            'attacks from other men and from wild animals as dwindling '
            'resources mean they have to travel farther from their homes to '
            'get water or firewood. “No place is safe for us,” Sitiyan says. '
            '“I was almost beaten up after some young men waylaid me on the '
            'way to the river, but I managed to escape. It is a risk we take '
            'daily in order to provide for our children.” For Sitiyan and the '
            '38 women in Umoja, the nearby Ewaso Ng’iro River was their main '
            'source of water. But its flow has been interrupted by extensive '
            'droughts that at times left the river bone dry. A decade ago, '
            'Nasa’s Earth Observatory described the riverbed as “a pale tan '
            'ribbon of sand” after a prolonged drought in 2009. At other '
            'times, the river has flooded and displaced thousands. The river '
            'has little water currently, and what there is is contaminated by '
            'domestic and wild animal waste.\n'
            'On a hot Thursday morning last week, the Guardian joined three '
            'women – Jane Nomong’en, Paulina Lekureiya and Kareni Lematile – '
            'for the 25-minute walk to the river. The unmarked route weaves '
            'through thick bushes. “This is where they hide,” Nomong’en says, '
            'pointing to a nearby thicket where a moran (young Samburu '
            'warrior) tended some goats. “There are no men in our village to '
            'protect us from the [troublemakers].” Along the route are several '
            'water pans dug in recent years to collect rainwater. It never '
            'rained.\n'
            'A steep gulley leads us to the riverbed where the women find a '
            'spot with soft sand and hope it will yield some underground '
            'water. Lematile, the youngest, is tasked with scooping out the '
            'sand with a cup to make a hole wide enough for water to seep up. '
            'It is exhausting. She takes a break every few minutes while the '
            'others keep watch. “A 14-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile '
            'while fetching water up there,” Lekureiya says. “A woman was also '
            'attacked by a crocodile near the same spot. She was five months '
            'pregnant. We run away from men only to meet crocodiles.” It takes '
            'Lematile 20 minutes of scooping out sand before water begins to '
            'collect at the bottom. Using the cup, she painstakingly collects '
            'the water in four, 10-litre containers. This takes another hour. '
            'The women take a cupful each, and so does Lematile’s son. “We get '
            'some stomach upsets but what options do we have?” says Lematile.\n'
            'About 100 metres away, a group of young men are scooping out '
            'large quantities of sand from the river to fill a truck and sell '
            'to developers, much to the chagrin of the women. Sand harvesting '
            'leaves the riverbed bare, unable to hold water during the dry '
            'season. It also results in floods during heavy rains. The women '
            'are afraid that if it goes on they will have to walk even farther '
            'to find water, exposing them to more risk of violence and attacks '
            'from wild animals. The women in Kenya’s arid areas know that '
            'their future security depends on political efforts being made far '
            'away this week at the Cop26 climate talks in Scotland, a country '
            'where turning on a tap brings instant water. “World leaders at '
            'Cop26 must deliver on promises to provide finance to these '
            'communities to enable them cope with the effects of climate '
            'crisis by addressing its root causes,” says Kitui.',

{'article': 'I was 19 when, in September 1987, I got a fortnight’s work '
            'experience on my local free newspaper, the Kingston Guardian, in '
            'south-west London. It was a small but dedicated team of reporters '
            'operating out of an office in Twickenham and they were incredibly '
            'generous, taking me under their collective wing and sending me '
            'out on all kinds of assignments. By the end of the two weeks, I '
            'had a handful of bylined pieces and had written my first '
            'investigative feature – a tug-of-love dog ownership dispute over '
            'a whippet. But the moment that changed me came on the very first '
            'day, on a story that I didn’t even write. The team had suggested '
            'I go out in the evening with an older reporter on a “death knock” '
            '– going to visit a family after a death. They didn’t call it a '
            'death knock and it wasn’t one of those notorious tabloid visits, '
            'when a reporter turns up out of the blue and confronts a bereaved '
            'family. It had been agreed in advance with the parents of the '
            'deceased, a 17-year-old schoolboy who had died in a car accident, '
            'not long after passing his driving test. It was the kind of '
            'awful, accidental death that happens regularly, all over the '
            'country. The reporter drove us to the house and we rang the bell. '
            'I was very nervous at the idea of meeting people suffering such '
            'grief. But when the father came to the door, he shook our hands, '
            'smiled and welcomed us in. He had been waiting for us and was '
            'happy to tell us all about the kind, wonderful young man his son '
            'had been. We sat on the sofa and I listened while he talked about '
            'his son: what a good person he had been, all his achievements at '
            'school, his hopes and plans. I still remember that he had got a '
            'place at the University of York, because that was where my '
            'brother had studied. The reporter was kind and professional and '
            'took it all down in shorthand. He asked more questions to make '
            'sure he had enough details. It probably took about half an hour. '
            'When we had finished, the reporter asked if the family had had a '
            'chance to think about a photo for the paper to use. Again, they '
            'had asked in advance of the visit. The father had remembered the '
            'request and had a lovely portrait ready on the mantelpiece, which '
            'he handed over. The reporter said he would make sure it was '
            'returned to them. It was very matter-of-fact and very English. '
            'The father seemed calm and polite. The reporter was kind and '
            'sensitive. I had never confronted death with a stranger before. '
            'There were no tears. I felt there might be some small comfort in '
            'knowing your child’s life and death were going to be marked and '
            'commemorated in the paper. It made me realise how journalists '
            'could provide an important service to their community, that they '
            'could be welcomed into the home of a bereaved family to help '
            'remember a life and record how a loved one mattered. I have taken '
            'that memory into every crime story I have covered. In 2006, while '
            'working as a reporter at Channel 4 News, I met the family of '
            '15-year-old Rochelle Holness, who had been murdered by a serial '
            'rapist, a man with a long criminal record of violence against '
            'women. Her remains had been found in bin bags near his flat. The '
            'Sun had published a horrible and untrue story, claiming that '
            'police told them she had still been alive when he dismembered her '
            'body. The Met police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, had recently '
            'said the press were racist in how they treated black victims and '
            'this seemed evidence of that. Rochelle was a black girl from a '
            'south London council estate. Would the Sun have speculated in '
            'print that way about a white girl? Rochelle’s mother, Jennifer '
            'Bennett, had kept a cuttings book of all the news clippings – '
            'even that Sun story. I was determined to counter the cruelty of '
            'those lies. In my report, after the killer was sentenced to a '
            'whole-life tariff, I interviewed Bennett, talking about what a '
            'fun daughter Rochelle had been. I showed a sequence of photos of '
            'her – from babyhood to her teenage years. She had been a loved '
            'child with her whole future ahead of her. I wanted viewers to '
            'know that her life mattered. Just as that 17-year-old boy’s had. '
            'I still have all my early clippings in a cuttings book. The story '
            'of that first death knock isn’t in it, of course, as I didn’t '
            'write up the report. But it is the experience that made me the '
            'journalist I am. Or at least try to be.',

{'article': 'Beneath the Spanish moss that swayed from an oak tree, Diane '
            'Arbery Jackson took a seat in the morning shade as the three '
            'white men accused of murdering her nephew sat in the courtroom a '
            'few feet away. For the past two weeks, Arbery has attended the '
            'jury selection process at the Glynn county courthouse every day. '
            'And every day, bar one, she has elected to stay outside on the '
            'grassy courtroom grounds. “It hurts to be in the same room as '
            'them,” she said. “It’s hard when you look at them, you think: '
            '‘How could they do a child like that?’ Ahmaud was a good kid. All '
            'you had to do was stop and talk to him. You didn’t have to go out '
            'to him with no guns. “But I know God is going to deal with '
            'them.”\n'
            'It was February last year when Ahmaud Arbery, a Black '
            '25-year-old, was jogging in the small coastal town of Satilla '
            'Shores. The three men accused of murder, Gregory McMichael, 67, '
            'his 35-year-old son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William '
            '“Roddie” Bryan, 52, all pursued Arbery claiming they suspected '
            'him of involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood. '
            'Arbery had been recorded on surveillance footage entering and '
            'leaving a semi-constructed house in the area, but no evidence has '
            'linked him to any offense. A scuffle occurred as the McMichaels, '
            'both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery, who was '
            'unarmed, with their pickup truck. Travis McMichael then opened '
            'fire three times with a shotgun. On Tuesday, after 11 days of '
            'jury selection, a panel of 65 jurors was finally selected from a '
            'pool of hundreds. Barring any unforeseen delays, including '
            'last-minute motions defense attorneys have suggested they will '
            'file, a final jury of 12 and four alternates will be seated this '
            'week, with opening arguments to follow, probably on Thursday. The '
            'trial of the three men, who have pleaded not guilty, occurs six '
            'months after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the white former '
            'police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis after '
            'pinning his neck to the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. '
            'That trial was undoubtedly a landmark moment for police reform '
            'advocates around the country, but, say many observers, the case '
            'of Ahmaud Arbery is a sterner litmus test for the state of racial '
            'justice in the US.\n'
            '“This case is almost a straight line from Emmett Till,” said the '
            'civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who represents the Arbery '
            'family. “Our legal system is statistically and continuously '
            'biased but it’s more of a test than Minneapolis and George Floyd '
            'because we are in the heart of white supremacy here in south '
            'Georgia.” Merritt’s point was illustrated by the immediate '
            'surroundings. He spoke to the Guardian on the steps of the '
            'courthouse – less than a mile away a monument to the Confederacy, '
            'wrapped in protective plastic since the start of the trial, still '
            'stands in a local park. City officials have said it will '
            'eventually be removed. But the legal particulars of this murder '
            'trial also point to history as well. The McMichaels’ defense is '
            'expected to hinge on a now defunct Georgia law that traces its '
            'roots to the state’s era of slavery and essentially allowed '
            'private citizens the power to arrest people if they had '
            '“reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion” of a felony being '
            'committed. In the wake of mass protest following Arbery’s death, '
            'Georgia’s Republican governor repealed the law, but attorneys for '
            'all three defendants are expected to utilize it throughout the '
            'trial. “They changed the law, but changing the law doesn’t affect '
            'us. It doesn’t change what was the law of the land at the time,” '
            'said Bryan’s defence attorney, Kevin Gough, last month.\n'
            'The backstory to the prosecution, too, points to evidence of '
            'insider politics and institutional racism in the local criminal '
            'justice world here. One of the first prosecutors assigned to the '
            'case, George Barnhill, initially recommended not charging any of '
            'those involved, claiming the pursuit was “perfectly legal” due to '
            'citizen’s arrest statutes. Barnhill, who had a chequered history '
            'of aggressively prosecuting Black residents in his jurisdiction, '
            'eventually recused himself from the case. Another former '
            'prosecutor initially assigned the case, Jackie Johnson, has been '
            'criminally charged for alleged misconduct in the process as '
            'Gregory McMichael had worked as an investigator in her office. '
            'The past two weeks have also highlighted the difficulties in '
            'impaneling a jury in this small rural county, composed of 69% '
            'white residents and 26% Black residents, and which voted 61% for '
            'Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Defense lawyers '
            'have argued many potential jurors have not shown up for jury duty '
            'as the court whittled the final number down to 65 people. '
            'Prospective jurors were questioned about their prior knowledge of '
            'the case, whether they had expressed support for the Black Lives '
            'Matter movement, and if they knew any of those involved. In a '
            'striking remark on Friday last week defense attorney Gough '
            'complained to the judge: “It would appear that white males born '
            'in the south over 40 years old without a college degree … which '
            'he might also be known as Bubba or Joe Sixpack … seem to be '
            'significantly underrepresented.” Still, despite these hurdles, '
            'Merritt was explicit about his expectations for accountability in '
            'the case: “We expect convictions on all charges. These men should '
            'be in prison for the rest of their lives. That will get us on the '
            'road to justice.” *** Among the small group of activists seated '
            'on the grass outside the courthouse was 68-year-old Patricia '
            'Fields, from the nearby town of Waycross. Like Diane Arbery '
            'Jackson she too has come to the courthouse every day and, in a '
            'recent week, went to visit Satilla Shores, the small neighborhood '
            'where Arbery was killed. “It’s eerie there,” she said. “It feels '
            'like there’s a shadow over it. That something is just not '
            'right.”\n'
            'On a trip earlier this week few residents of Satilla Shores '
            'wanted to speak about the Arbery murder case. Along neatly kept '
            'lawns, a number of houses still display Trump 2020 presidential '
            'campaign placards and a golf cart was daubed in a sign that read: '
            '“Impeach Biden”. There is no memorial or marker at the site where '
            'Arbery was gunned down. For a case that is tied so deeply to '
            'atrocities of the past, the murder of Ahmaud Arbery is also '
            'closely linked to prosecutions from recent memory. The presence '
            'of eyewitness video, filmed by Bryan as he took part in the '
            'pursuit from behind, is set to play a pivotal role in the case. '
            'It took months for the footage to emerge, as the case sat in '
            'relative obscurity away from the gaze of most national media. The '
            'absence of publicly available footage undoubtedly contributed to '
            'the initial decision not to indict the three men now standing '
            'trial. It was not until the video was made public that the case '

{'article': 'A government contractor has paid out “substantial” compensation '
            'following the death of a young mother who took an overdose after '
            'her disability benefits were removed. Philippa Day, 27, a single '
            'mother from Nottingham who had longstanding mental health issues, '
            'died in hospital in October 2019, two months after taking an '
            'overdose. She had endured months of stress and anxiety after a '
            'long struggle with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and '
            'Capita to reinstate her benefits. An inquest into her death '
            'identified 28 instances where “systemic errors” by both the DWP '
            'and its contractor had led to failures in the handling of Day’s '
            'claim. These failures were a “stressor” in her decision to take '
            'the overdose, the coroner ruled, although he was unable to '
            'conclude she had intended to take her own life. In May, Day’s '
            'family issued a compensation claim for negligence to both the DWP '
            'and Capita. The latter subsequently agreed to settle out of '
            'court. The sum was not disclosed but is understood to be in line '
            'with what the family was asking for. The family said the money '
            'would be used to provide for Day’s son’s future. Imogen Day, '
            'Philippa’s sister, said: “Our family has always maintained that '
            'my sister’s treatment by Capita, on behalf of the DWP, directly '
            'impacted her mental state and in the end is the reason for her '
            'death. Capita’s wall of bureaucracy, with no consideration for '
            'Philippa’s mental state, exacerbated her despair at her debt and '
            'poverty. She was met with cold, uncaring call operators who would '
            'not listen to her cries for help.” She added: “This settlement '
            'will in some measure provide for Philippa’s family and a '
            'materially stable upbringing for Philippa’s son, but he has lost '
            'his mother, and there is nothing Capita can do to put right the '
            'wrong that contributed to Philippa’s death.” It is believed to be '
            'the first time an agent of the DWP has settled a legal claim '
            'brought as a result of their errors. Capita, which administers '
            'disability benefits under contract to DWP, has also agreed to '
            'meet the family to discuss ways to improve its interactions with '
            'benefits claimants. A Capita spokesperson said: “We are very '
            'sorry for the mistakes we made in processing Philippa’s personal '
            'independence payment (PIP) claim and the additional stress this '
            'caused her. In partnership with the DWP, we have considered and '
            'reviewed the coroner’s report and we are implementing all the '
            'recommendations that are relevant to us. “Following this '
            'incident, we have strengthened our processes and we are working '
            'to continuously improve and deliver a professional, efficient and '
            'kind service for every PIP applicant we assess.” The family’s '
            'lawyer, Merry Varney of solicitors Leigh Day, welcomed the '
            'settlement: “Capita has shown acceptance of their failures and a '
            'willingness to ensure their mistakes are not repeated. However, '
            'there remain too many examples of the DWP, which controls the '
            'financial circumstances of the majority of people too sick to '
            'work, acting inhumanely to those receiving benefits and a '
            'continued resistance by the DWP to transparent investigations '
            'into benefit-related deaths.” A DWP spokesperson said in '
            'statement: “Our condolences remain with the Day family. We cannot '
            'comment on active legal proceedings.” It is not clear to which '
            'legal proceedings they refer to as Leigh Day has confirmed '
            'Capita’s settlement means no further legal action is outstanding '
            'regarding the Philippa Day case. The DWP was issued by the '
            'coroner with a prevention of future deaths notice at the inquest '
            'requiring it to set out how it would improve its services. In its '
            'formal response in April it said it recognised “the need to treat '
            'everyone with empathy and care; especially those with mental '
            'health conditions”. It said it had introduced specialist mental '
            'health and behaviour and relationships training for all new staff '
            'handling disability benefits. It added it was “determined to '
            'learn from this deeply tragic case”. Day was described by her '
            'family as an intelligent, beautiful and “effervescent” woman who '
            'loved her young son and had ambitions to train as a nurse. She '
            'had endured mental illness and type 1 diabetes since childhood. '
            'She had a record of self-harm and suicide attempts and had '
            'several stays in psychiatric care. Her life became increasingly '
            'stressful and chaotic after her benefits were reduced from £228 a '
            'week to just £60 as a result of a botched benefits application. '
            'Her distressed state was captured in a recording of a phone call '
            'to a benefits official in June 2019, played at the inquest, in '
            'which she pleaded for help. In tears, Day had told the official: '
            '“I’ve been waiting for six months now. I’m literally starving, I '
            'can’t survive for much longer.” She added: “[I’m in] £5,000 debt. '
            'Nothing to eat. I’ve lost all my [benefit] premiums … I cannot '
            'survive … without any money. I need something to live for.” After '
            'her benefits were finally reinstated, Day – who was agoraphobic – '
            'became increasingly terrified and anxious as DWP officials '
            'insisted she be retested at a face-to-face meeting at a benefits '
            'assessment centre or face losing her benefits. Her sister told '
            'the inquest this was the “straw that broke the camel’s back”.',

            'water”. Last year, the dairy industry tried (and failed) to get a '

            '“the lacteal secretion … obtained by the complete milking of a '

            'police after the four-year-old was rescued from a Carnarvon house '
            'more than two weeks after she vanished from a remote campsite.\n'
            'WA police on Wednesday afternoon said a 36-year-old man taken '
            'into custody following Cleo’s discovery was yet to be charged but '
            'they expected that to occur “probably” later in the day. '
            'Investigators have said the man had no connection to Cleo’s '
            'family and he only became a suspect in the alleged abduction on '
            'Tuesday night. In a press conference outside the Carnarvon police '
            'station on Wednesday afternoon, the commissioner, Chris Dawson, '
            'held up the picture of Cleo declaring “it is a wonderful day”. '
            'The picture was taken earlier on Wednesday when Cleo was in '
            'hospital where she had been taken for medical tests. She had '
            'since been discharged and was back with her parents. Police also '
            'released footage from an officer’s body camera showing the moment '
            'Cleo was carried out of the Carnarvon house.\n'
            '“It is a really special day for Western Australia,” Dawson said. '
            '“I’m just the proudest police commissioner I think in the world '
            'at the moment.” Det Sgt Cameron Blaine, who was one of the four '
            'officers who raided the house in Carnarvon and was the one to ask '
            'Cleo what her name was, described the four-year-old as “very '
            'trusting and open” with officers. He also said she was energetic. '
            '“She’s a little Energizer bunny,” he said. “How she has that much '
            'energy. I wish I did. We all wanted to take turns holding her.” '
            'Blaine said Wednesday morning was “the best moment” of his '
            'career. He described the moment Cleo was reunited with her family '
            'and said the four-year-old exclaimed “mum”. There were “big hugs, '
            'kisses and lots of tears”, Blaine said. Sign up to receive an '
            'email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'Det Supt Rod Wilde, who led the investigation, said Wednesday '

            'and “they were ecstatic”. Cleo’s mother, Ellie Smith, posted on '
            'Instagram about 6am local time about her daughter’s discovery '
            'with the caption “our family is whole again”. Dawson said '
            'chocolates and flowers had been left at the police station '
            'throughout Wednesday.\n'
            'The WA police minister, Paul Papalia, said: “If you feel the need '
            'to thank God today, thank God for the West Australian police '
            'force. Cleo’s rescue wasn’t the result of an accidental sighting '
            'or a suspicious event, it was the result of hard police grind '
            'from the moment this incident began.” The prime minister, Scott '
            'Morrison, said Cleo’s disappearance had “captured the hearts of '
            'Australians” and “I just thank God that Cleo is home and that she '
            'is safe”. “The fact that that nightmare has come to an end and '
            'our worst fears were not realised is just a huge relief and a '
            'moment for great joy,” Morrison said during a press conference in '
            'Dubai on Wednesday.\n'
            'The West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said Cleo’s discovery '
            'was a surprise. “It often is a tragic outcome [in such cases] but '
            'this is great news and uplifting for the entire country,” McGowan '
            'said. Police officers found Cleo about 1am local time on '
            'Wednesday morning alone in a room at a house in Carnarvon, a town '
            'roughly 900km north of Perth on WA’s north-west coast, and just '
            '75km from where her family was camping when she disappeared from '

            'they received information on Tuesday that, together with previous '
            'findings, led them to the Carnarvon address where Cleo was found. '
            'Deputy police commissioner Col Blanch, speaking to the ABC on '

{'article': 'The Commonwealth Bank will allow its customers to buy and sell '
            'cryptocurrency through its app, in the first move of its kind by '
            'a major Australian bank. Australia’s largest bank announced on '
            'Wednesday it had partnered with US-based crypto exchange Gemini '
            'and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to offer the service to '
            'its 6.5m CommBank app users. Customers will be able to buy up to '
            '10 crypto assets including bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. The '
            'bank will conduct a pilot in the next few weeks, ahead of a wider '
            'launch in 2022.\n'
            '“We believe we can play an important role in crypto to address '
            'what’s clearly a growing customer need and provide capability, '
            'security and confidence in a crypto trading platform,” CBA’s '
            'chief executive Matt Comyn said in a statement. The bank said '
            'research on its customers found many had either expressed '
            'interest in crypto assets, or were already trading crypto through '
            'exchanges. “Customers have expressed concern regarding some of '
            'the crypto services in the market today, including the friction '
            'of using third party exchanges, the risk of fraud, and the lack '
            'of trust in some new providers. This is why we see this as an '
            'opportunity to bring a trusted and secure experience for our '
            'customers,” Comyn said. Dr Dimitrios Salampasis, a lecturer of '
            'fintech leadership and entrepreneurship at Swinburne Business '
            'School, said he was not surprised CBA had entered the '
            'cryptocurrency field. He said the bank was trying to get first '
            'mover advantage in Australia, and hoped it would bring more '
            'legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space. “Having this coming from '
            'a systemic and the biggest bank in Australia, it’s definitely a '
            'move that will change a lot,” he said. “And it will hopefully '
            'bring legitimacy, bring further harmonisation, push further '
            'regulation and also minimise debanking, which has been a massive '
            'pain for all cryptocurrency startups in particular.” Debanking is '
            'where financial institutions refuse to offer services to '
            'businesses in Australia. A Senate select committee report on '
            'fintech services in Australia, tabled this month, cited several '
            'cryto businesses that had been rejected by dozens of financial '
            'institutions in Australia, such as the exchange Bitcoin Babe. The '
            'committee, chaired by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, recommended '
            'the government regulate the sector to allow it to fully operate '
            'in Australia, including a market licensing regime for digital '
            'currency exchanges, and for the government to develop a clear '
            'process for businesses to deal with debanking. Salampasis said '
            'the committee’s report, along with CBA’s gradual move into the '
            'sector, would likely foster regulation of cryptocurrency in '
            'Australia. “There has to be regulation, there has to be '
            'provisions, especially in relation to custody, especially in '
            'relation to licensing,” he said.\n'
            '“I do believe that Australia has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity '
            'to become a leader in the space and really drive a complete '
            'regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.” Bragg welcomed the '

{'article': 'Too vast in scope to be contained within war drama, the Holocaust '
            'movie constitutes an entire genre unto itself, collecting a '
            'potentially infinite number of tragedies great and small. The '
            'history of the 20th century’s most massive atrocity comes with '
            'thousands of footnotes now gradually expanded upon by media '
            'depicting the unsung courage and untold evil. Israeli documentary '
            'film-makers Daniel Sivan and Mor Loushy singled out one such '
            'extraordinary tale for their latest joint project, Netflix’s '
            'short film Camp Confidential, drawing attention to a highly '
            'covert military operation only recently released from behind '
            'redaction-marker bars. “The first thing is, when producers Benji '
            'and Jono Bergmann approached us with this and told us of the '
            'story, we didn’t believe it,” Sivan tells the Guardian. “It was '
            'just so out-there.”\n'
            'The black-op facility tucked away in northern Virginia’s Fairfax '
            'county sounds like something out of a pulp paperback: Jewish '
            'soldiers, many of them refugees from the devastation in Europe, '
            'watched over Nazi prisoners of war in a surreally domestic '
            'setting. Known as PO Box 1142, it housed such notables as '
            'spymaster Reinhard Gehlen and rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, '
            'who faced interrogations that would help lift the Allies to '
            'victory in the second world war. But those in charge of the base '
            'were also tasked with maintaining a baseline quality of life for '
            'the inmates, leading to bizarre scenes such as a department store '
            'outing with former members of the Third Reich to purchase '
            'unmentionables for their wives. Bulldozed at the end of the war '
            'and buried in secrecy until the National Parks Service unearthed '
            'some remnants in the early 2000s, the clandestine camp now '
            'doubles as a cautionary tale for modern Jews and a memorial for '
            'those who came before them. “We had hours of these interviews, '
            'and I remember very vividly that we were shocked,” Loushy says. '
            '“I had chills. This was an unbelievable relationship forming '
            'there, between the Jewish refugees and the Nazis who would’ve '
            'captured them. Nobody knew about it, and the people who conducted '
            'the interviews never told anyone about it. They didn’t even tell '
            'their wives or children –they took this secret to their grave.”\n'
            'Sivan and Loushy had the privilege of sitting down with Arno '
            'Mayer and Peter Wiess, two veterans of this odd operation, '
            'thought to be the last living survivors able to set the record '
            'straight. With candor and a little apprehension, the two men '
            'recall a confounding daily contrast, caught between the '
            'satisfaction of sweating their captive guests and the indignity '
            'of catering to their needs. In one of the many flashback scenes '
            'rendered as animation to capture the dreamlike quality of memory, '
            'we see Jewish soldiers using the Nazis’ own inhumanity against '
            'them by flooding a van with dust from a vacuum cleaner and '
            'letting the sadists assume they were being gassed, just like '
            'they’d be doing if the positions were reversed. The former '
            'servicemen claim to have taken the high ground and avoided '
            'outright torture, instead gaining the prisoners’ trust by playing '
            'host in their new country of America. “You can hear so many '
            'instances of them asking the interviewers, ‘Is this safe? Can we '
            'talk? Is this not censored?’” Sivan says. “It took everybody a '
            'long time to understand that yes, it is safe to discuss this. '
            'When you listen to the audio tapes, once they started talking, '
            'you see a combination of pride and shame at the same time. On the '
            'one hand, they feel that they did collect important intelligence, '
            'and they did succeed in their mission. But on the other, they did '
            'take part in whitewashing the German ex-Nazi scientists into '
            'becoming the perfect American heroes.” As the film explains, '
            'there’s a bitter irony to the fate of Wernher von Braun, vilified '
            'during the war right up until the US government figured his '
            'scientific acumen could be put to good use. Under Operation '
            'Paperclip, hundreds of Nazi technicians were brought to the '
            'States and put to work before they could get snapped up by Space '
            'Race rivals in the Soviet Union, an unsavory gambit that paid off '
            'when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon. But the '
            'image rehabilitation von Braun enjoyed as a principal architect '
            'of rocket travel – the medals, the smiling photo ops next to '
            'President Kennedy – left a bad taste in the mouths of those who '
            'recalled his heinous deeds. “We all know that [von Braun] knew '
            'about Auschwitz, and that he participated with the Nazi regime,” '
            'Loushy says. “The US, in giving him citizenship with all the '
            'other scientists, showed what was important to them.” “They’re '
            'different, Arno and Peter,” Sivan adds. “What Peter really wanted '
            'to convey was the question of whether bad means can be justified '
            'by a good cause. He believed the cause was righteous, but that '
            'the means of achieving it were so corrupt that it wasn’t worth '
            'it. Arno, however, wanted to talk about the cold war. During the '
            'second world war, while the fighting was still going on, his '
            'mission was to start fighting the Russians. The fact is that the '
            'US had already targeted a new archenemy, and it’s shocking to see '
            'how fluid it is, the changing of enemies. Who was once your '
            'friend and ally is now the source of all evil. And these Nazis, '
            'who were the pinnacle of evil, were suddenly our best friends.”\n'
            'The film-makers view this chapter of the past as a moral and '
            'ethical thought experiment with ample resonance to the present, '
            'weighing pragmatism in the national interest against the sin of '
            'whitewashing. Does building an effective coalition supersede the '
            'mandate to hold fascists accountable for their actions? Neither '
            'Sivan nor Loushy is all that convinced. “I personally believe '
            'that evil is evil, and don’t think that a few years can change '
            'that,” he says. “People taking part in mass murder, even if they '
            'were not physically part of it, they were in support of it.” “You '
            'see these Jewish refugees who’d escaped Europe a few years '
            'before, all of their families murdered in the Holocaust, and now '
            'they’ve got to form a relationship with Nazis?” Loushy adds. '
            '“It’s absolutely insane. There’s a red line to causes, at the end '
            'of the day. The Nazis committed crimes against humanity.” With '
            'domestic Nazi activity and Russia paranoia both having spiked '
            'under Trump, the takeaway from this brutal social studies lesson '
            'is clear: the nasty tendency to overlook transgressions for the '
            'sake of political usefulness hasn’t gone anywhere. We’re still '
            'repeating the mistakes of previous generations, putting what’s '
            'expedient over what’s right, leaving the civilian souls caught in '
            'the crossfire to be forgotten, abandoned, or ignored. Mayer and '
            'Weiss share their recollections in the hope that we can break '
            'this cycle, and hold our leaders to a higher standard of '
            'humanity. “This is not a story of the past,” Sivan says. “The US '
            'is collaborating today with a bunch of dark regimes, Israel as '
            'well. If you look anywhere in the world, Europe or Asia, '
            'everyone’s working with tyrants and other people who have blood '
            'on their hands. It’s always in the ‘national interest,’ too. This '
            'isn’t a story about terrible things that happened back in the '
            '’40s. We didn’t learn our lesson.” Camp Confidential: America’s '

{'article': 'As Scott Morrison flew towards Australia’s military base for '
            'operations in the Middle East on Wednesday, Jean-Pierre Thébault '
            'was using an appearance at the National Press Club in Canberra to '
            'continue France’s rolling excoriation of Australia’s conduct '
            'while dumping a multibillion-dollar submarine contract. By the '
            'time Morrison touched down in the desert, the French ambassador '
            'had landed a potent extrapolation. If Scott Morrison’s operation '
            'was prepared to leak private text messages from world leaders to '
            'settle diplomatic scores, who could trust Australia?\n'
            '“You don’t behave like this on personal exchanges of leaders,” '
            'Thébault said in Canberra. “Doing this also sends a very worrying '
            'signal for all heads of state. Beware, in Australia, there will '
            'be leaks, and what you say in confidence to your partners will '
            'eventually be used and weaponised against you.” I doubt you’ve '
            'missed the saga of the text messages, but just in case – the '
            'morning after Emmanuel Macron told Australian journalists on the '
            'sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome that Morrison had lied to him '
            'during the fracas, one of the president’s private texts turned up '
            'in some Australian media outlets. Two days before Morrison, Boris '
            'Johnson and Joe Biden terminated Australia’s contract with the '
            'French Naval Group to build diesel submarines in mid-September '
            'and replaced it with the Aukus pact, Macron had asked Morrison: '
            '“Should I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines '
            'ambitions?” This text was submitted as evidence that Macron’s '
            'outrage – the accusations about lying and Australia stabbing '
            'France in the back – were entirely confected, because the '
            'president knew all along the French contract was about to be '
            'dumped. Actually, the message confirmed exactly the opposite. It '
            'shows Macron didn’t know what was happening two days before three '
            'leaders humiliated France with the Aukus announcement – which '
            'you’ll recall was livestreamed to the world. So as ruthless '
            'exercises in domestic damage control go, this was a particularly '
            'wild one. Measured in terms of international relations, this was '
            'high-cost, low-efficiency. Presumably, the score-settling '
            'reflected the fury of Australia’s prime minister after Macron '
            'launched his drive-by character assassination at the G20. '
            'Morrison was as angry as I have ever seen him on learning of '
            'Macron’s accusation. But if it was an impulse, a lashing out, his '
            'revenge play, once unleashed, could not be rescinded. Morrison '
            'has had plenty of opportunities to deny his office leaked the '
            'texts. He has not done so. He has also not expressed any remorse '
            'about it either. Asked on the ground at the Al Minhad air base '
            'what the threshold had been for engaging in retributive conduct '
            'entirely outside diplomatic rules of engagement – was the trigger '
            'one world leader (Macron) accusing another one (Morrison) of '
            'lying – Morrison doubled down. “Claims had been made and those '
            'claims were refuted,” the prime minister said. Implicit in this '
            'is Macron was the one who shifted the goalposts by launching a '
            'personal attack. Morrison does have a point. There was nothing '
            'diplomatic in the French president’s observation at the G20. It '
            'was an extraordinary moment. Morrison responded with an '
            'extraordinary moment of his own.\n'
            'But the rapid escalation has removed all the guard rails and '
            'conventions that normally restrain the apex predators of politics '
            'from engaging in unmasked aggression against their peers. '
            'Morrison understood he was now in uncharted territory – which is '
            'why the prime minister declared an armistice during his brief '
            'stopover in the Middle East. The prime minister thought now '
            'everybody had got various things off their chests, it was time to '
            'get past the muck. “Claims were made and claims were refuted, '
            'what is needed now is for us to move on – that is what is '
            'important the Australian people”. What’s important, according to '
            'Morrison’s telling, was he, Scott Morrison, had made the right '
            'call by replacing French diesel powered submarines with nuclear '
            'ones. He, Morrison, had “delivered an incredibly important '
            'capability to Australia to keep us safe and defend and protect '
            'Australia – that’s the most important thing, that is what is at '
            'issue here”. “That is the thing that matters most to Australians '
            '– that we do everything we can to ensure the Australian defences '
            'are the best they possibly can be and the men and women who serve '
            'get the best. That’s what I was seeking to do and if others have '
            'other motives, others have other agendas, well that’s for them”. '
            'The means justify the ends, in other words. Nothing else matters. '
            'Morrison is still a relatively new player on the global stage, '
            'but his global counterparts have learned something important '
            'about Australia’s prime minister in this episode. Morrison '
            'doesn’t need to be liked. He doesn’t need to be trusted – and in '
            'a domestic political context, Morrison is not trusted either by '
            'colleagues or by adversaries. Morrison’s confidence in his own '
            'instincts and decisions is absolute.\n'
            'He doesn’t need anyone to prop him up, or validate his choices. '
            'His emotional hinterland is outside of politics. In the prime '
            'ministership, he is an island. What’s important is the will to '
            'power, which for Morrison, takes form in a sense of relentless '
            'righteousness. What is important to Morrison is whatever it takes '
            'to win the next political battle. International relations are '
            'only important insofar as they express themselves through the '
            'prism of domestic politics. Morrison thinks he’s on a winner. '
            'Macron might be a casualty of that. Australian taxpayers might '
            'have to fork out billions to decouple from the Naval Group. But '
            'if it’s a winning play, the costs don’t matter.',

{'article': 'The French ambassador has denounced the Australian government’s '
            'release of a private text message from Emmanuel Macron as “an '
            'unprecedented new low”, arguing other world leaders would now '
            'worry their words might be “weaponised” against them. Jean-Pierre '
            'Thébault said the leaking of the text message from the French '
            'president was a setback “in terms of truth and trust”, and it '
            'would be “sad” if this was the Australian government’s answer to '
            'France’s request for concrete actions to heal the relationship. '
            'The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters in '
            'Dubai on Wednesday he would “never make any apologies” for '
            'scrapping the French contract to deliver submarines that were '
            '“not going to do the job that Australia needed [them] to do”. '
            'Morrison did not dispute a suggestion that his office had leaked '
            'the text message, simply saying: “Claims had been made and those '
            'claims were refuted … what is needed now is for us to move on.” '
            'The extraordinary rift between Australia and France flows from '
            'Macron’s accusation that Morrison lied to him over plans with the '
            'US and the UK to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines as a '
            'replacement for the $90bn French project. Morrison rejected '
            'Macron’s claim and several Australian media outlets then reported '
            'that the French president had texted the Australian prime '
            'minister two days before the Aukus announcement in mid-September '
            'to ask: “Should I expect good or bad news for our joint '
            'submarines ambitions?” Thébault said far from backing the '
            'Australian government’s position that it had been candid with '
            'France about its changing needs, the text “demonstrates that '
            'until the last minute, we didn’t know where things were heading '
            'to”. The French ambassador told the National Press Club in '
            'Canberra the leak of the text would not help build confidence to '
            'repair the relationship. “This is an unprecedented new low - in '
            'terms of how to proceed, and also, in terms of truth and trust,” '
            'Thébault said. “You don’t behave like this on personal exchanges '
            'of leaders who are allies. But maybe it’s just confirmation that '
            'we were never seen as an ally. “But doing so also sends a very '
            'worrying signal for all heads of state - beware, in Australia, '
            'there will be leaks, and what you say in confidence to your '
            'partners will be eventually used and weaponised against you one '
            'day.” Asked whether Morrison should apologise to Macron – a '
            'suggestion made by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull – the '
            'ambassador said the US had taken concrete steps to mend ties over '
            'what Joe Biden called the “clumsy” handling of the Aukus '
            'partnership. Thébault said eating “humble pie” may “sometimes be '
            'difficult” and it was “up to everyone to make his own decision”. '
            'The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, defended the release of '
            'the text message, suggesting Macron had triggered that action by '
            'claiming Morrison had lied. “It [the leak] is not as '
            'extraordinary as calling the leader of another country a liar '
            'when they’re not,” Joyce told ABC TV. The French ambassador was '
            'recalled to Paris in September after Australia scrapped a $90bn '
            'French deal in order to launch an 18-month study with the US and '
            'the UK on acquiring nuclear-propelled submarines. Having now '
            'returned to Canberra, Thébault said the Morrison government had '
            'acted in a way that was “out of this world” and not befitting of '
            'friends, and he questioned whether any other partner could now '
            'trust “the value of Australia’s signature and commitment”. '
            'Thébault also raised doubts about whether Australia’s new '
            'partnership with the US and the UK would deliver '
            'nuclear-propelled submarines quickly enough: “Magical thinking '
            'will not change the facts.”\n'
            'And he said Australia would be scrutinised by the rest of the '
            'world over its “very specific responsibilities”, arguing the deal '
            'could have implications “in terms of our common efforts to '
            'strengthen nonproliferation norms”. “France will always be a '
            'close and loyal friend of Australia,” he said. “No artificial '
            'wedge, despite attempts, can be put between our people. If there '
            'is a problem today it is with certain aspects of the ‘Canberra '
            'bubble’ and its ‘secret city’ practices.” Thébault said the '
            'defence and foreign ministers of France and Australia met just '
            'two weeks before Aukus was announced, with both sides agreeing to '
            'a joint statement that underlined the importance of the future '
            'submarine program. “Do you agree on such a joint communique when '
            'there is the slightest doubt on something so massive as the '
            'official backbone of our cooperation? Maybe on Mars. But not on '
            'this planet,” Thébault said. Thébault suggested that the reason '
            'the Australian government did not want to be explicit was '
            'explained by Morrison on 16 September, when the prime minister '
            'said there was never any certainty that the Aukus process would '
            'result in a deal. Thébault said that meant it was deemed '
            'necessary to keep open the possibility of continuing the French '
            'submarine program, “and so it was mandatory to keep us in the '
            'dark, on the backburner”. Arguing “the deceit was intentional”, '
            'Thébault said: “Because there was far more at stake than '
            'providing submarines, because it was a common agreement on '
            'sovereignty, sealed with the transmission of highly classified '
            'data, the way it was handled was a stab in the back.” He '
            'acknowledged that the Australian government would make its own '
            'decisions when it came to national security. “But the way this '
            'Australian government decided to turn its back on our solemn and '
            'far reaching partnership, without ever frankly consulting with '
            'France, when there were countless opportunities, without having '
            'shared frankly and openly its thoughts or without having looked '
            'for alternatives with France, is just out of this world,” '
            'Thébault said. “Alarm bells should have rung on the likely '
            'consequences. And if it was the case, and they were disregarded, '
            'it is even worse.”\n'
            'Thébault said the Naval Group-backed project to deliver 12 '
            'conventional submarines had not been “troubled” or suffered cost '
            'blowouts, despite an “intensive smearing campaign” about the '
            'program. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '

{'article': 'America’s recent focus on 22-year-old Gabby Petito, whose body '
            'was found last month in a remote part of Wyoming, revived '
            'criticism of “missing white woman syndrome” and the media’s '
            'failure to convey that Black lives matter too. There are few '
            'starker example than Kendrick Johnson, an African American '
            'teenager found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his high school '
            'gymnasium in 2013. How and why he lost his life remains a mystery '
            'that has never been solved.\n'
            '“Kendrick went missing: nobody searched for him,” his mother, '
            'Jacqueline Johnson, says to the Guardian by phone from Valdosta, '
            'Georgia. “Nobody called a US marshal or the FBI for him. Nobody '
            'called all those people in. They didn’t put it all over the news. '
            'They didn’t do none of it. “You see the imbalance right there. If '
            'a Black person goes missing it’s just like they don’t really '
            'care. As soon she [Gabby Petito] goes missing, because of her '
            'colour, she gets all the media, all the shows, everything. '
            'Everywhere you see Ms Petito. Nobody else matters.” Local and '
            'state authorities ruled 17-year-old Kendrick’s death a freak '
            'accident, concluding that he got stuck in the middle of the mat '
            'while reaching for a gym shoe and was unable to breathe. '
            'Jacqueline and her husband Kenneth insist that he was murdered, '
            'accuse law enforcement and school officials of a cover-up and '
            'continue to wage a campaign for the truth. The case is the '
            'subject of a new documentary, Finding Kendrick Johnson, based on '
            'a four-year undercover investigation into a tangled web of '
            'allegations, new evidence and alarming questions over '
            'authorities’ handling of the tragedy. With didactic narration by '
            'actor and activist Jenifer Lewis, the film demands that attention '
            'must be paid.\n'
            'Kendrick was a sports-loving teenager. Jacqueline, 49, recalls: '
            '“He was the baby of our family. He was just like the funniest '
            'person ever. He played three sports all the way up through high '
            'school: he played football and basketball and he ran track. '
            'Football was his passion in life. Older kids looked up to him '
            'because he would say, ‘Yeah, one day I’m going to make it in '
            'football. Y’all going to see.’” The bright shard of memory '
            'darkens. “They just took his dream away and they took our goal '
            'away because that was our goal for him. He loved football. I '
            'would say two or three years old, he was out there playing '
            'football with his dad and brothers, and then when he was old '
            'enough to get on the field, he was playing football ever since he '
            'was four years old.” When she thinks of Kendrick now, Jacqueline '
            'says, “it’s so much hurt, so much pain. We can’t even really '
            'begin to grieve or mourn because of the fight we’ve had to '
            'endure.” Fellow students found Kendrick’s body in the gymnasium '
            'at Lowndes high school in Valdosta – a town in the deep south '
            'where Confederate monuments still stand - at around 10.30am on 11 '
            'January 2013. Kendrick was 5ft 10in; the rolled up mat is 6ft '
            'tall. The mat was propped upright against a wall next to the gym '
            'bleachers. Sheriff’s investigators closed the case four months '
            'later, concluding that Kendrick died in a bizarre accident while '
            'reaching for a shoe inside one of the mats. A state medical '
            'examiner ruled the cause of death was “positional asphyxia”, '
            'meaning the teenager got stuck upside down in a position that '
            'left him unable to breathe. But Kendrick’s family were left with '
            'many unanswered questions. There were strange gaps in '
            'surveillance footage from the gym. The county coroner was not '
            'called to the scene until six hours after Johnson’s body was '
            'found; under Georgia law he should have been notified '
            'immediately.\n'
            'The family secured a judge’s order to exhume the body so that a '
            'second autopsy could be performed. A private pathologist found '
            'haemorrhaging beneath the skin of Johnson’s jaw and neck and '
            'concluded he suffered a fatal blow near his carotid artery that '
            'appeared to be “non-accidental”. The second autopsy made another '
            'shocking discovery: Kendrick’s internal organs were missing and '
            'paper had been stuffed into the cavities (the fate of the organs '
            'remains unknown). In October 2013 a federal criminal civil rights '
            'investigation was announced, leading to interviews with almost a '
            'hundred people, but the justice department closed the case in '
            'June 2016, saying investigators “found insufficient evidence to '
            'support federal criminal charges”. The Johnson family also '
            'pursued various civil lawsuits without success; they were even '
            'countersued and face potential legal costs of hundreds of '
            'thousands of dollars. “My whole family is hurt because they '
            'treated us like we’re the ones who have committed a crime and '
            'instead we’re the victims,” Jacquelyn reflects. “We’re Kendrick’s '
            'mother and father and family and friends, and they treated us '
            'like we’ve committed a crime. It’s hurtful and it’s so wrong on '
            'so many levels.” Brian and Branden Bell, white classmates of '
            'Kendrick, were reportedly considered persons of interest in the '
            'FBI investigation. The brothers were never charged and an FBI '
            'video analysis determined they were in different parts of the '
            'school when Kendrick went to the gym. (Their father, Rick Bell, '
            'was an FBI agent who resigned after his house was raided for '
            'evidence.) The brothers told investigators and the media that '
            'they did not see Kendrick on the day of his death. But the '
            'documentary dug up surveillance footage showing Kendrick standing '
            'about four feet from Brian Bell in a school hallway, as well as '
            'an unredacted FBI report that states: “Kendrick Johnson is '
            'observed in a covered walkway moving towards the camera. Bell is '
            'observed in the same location at this time.” The Bell brothers '
            'deny any wrongdoing. The film’s writer director, Jason Pollock, '
            'first met Jacquelyn when he was living in Ferguson, Missouri, '
            'during the uprising that followed the death of Michael Brown, a '
            'Black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white police officer '
            '(the subject of his film Stranger Fruit). After becoming Facebook '
            'friends with Jacquelyn, Pollock noticed graphic pictures of '
            'Kendrick’s mutilated face cropping up daily in his feed.\n'
            'As the film highlights, Jacquelyn’s willingness to share the '
            'harrowing image of her son evokes Emmett Till, a 14-year-old '
            'Black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, whose mother decided to '
            'have an open casket so the world could see what had been done to '
            'him. The killers were never brought to justice but the searing '
            'image was galvanising for the civil rights movement. Jacquelyn '
            'believes that someone first posted the image with malicious '
            'intent. “I would never have shared no photo of him looking the '
            'way he looked – as a mother, it hurts me that you would see that '
            'picture – but I began to share that and remind the people this is '
            'what they did to my child.” Moved and incensed, Pollock went on '
            'to spend four years researching Kendrick’s death, determined to '
            'show that it is a burning injustice long overdue a fresh look. '
            '“If a white kid had been rolled up in the gym that day, I '
            'wouldn’t have had to do this,” he says by phone from California. '
            '“We wouldn’t even be talking right now because the system would '
            'have done its job and the system didn’t do its job from day one. '
            'They wanted to make this look like it was an accident because '
            'they didn’t want to do an investigation.” Pollock continues: “The '
            'whole story is just Shakespearean, what they’re going through, '
            'watching the state abuse them like this. The film doesn’t come to '
            'a conclusion. We’re not trying to support any conspiracy theories '
            'but we’re just trying to show the facts that we’re giving the '
            'light of day. “I hope this piece of art puts a human face on the '
            'trauma as well as just gets the story out there. We don’t know '
            'what happened. But this is a story we should be talking about '
            'because I do believe he is our generation’s Emmett Till.” The '
            'director, who started his career working for the documentarian '
            'Michael Moore, has become a fierce advocate for the family. “We '
            'are calling on President Biden and his team to review the '
            'malpractice at the FBI and the DoJ with the Kendrick Johnson case '
            'and unless Washington DC starts looking at this case, the state '
            'of Georgia is never going to deal with this. “If you want to '
            'clean up the act of our nation, you need to clean up this case '
            'because this is a really, really, really bad one and this family '
            'deserves way more from America than they’ve gotten. If you care '
            'about Black Lives Matter issues, you need to take the Kendrick '
            'Johnson case on in Washington and deal with this.”\n'
            'Finding Kendrick Johnson opens with whistleblower Mitch Credle, a '
            '23-year veteran homicide detective with Washington police who '
            'investigated Johnson’s death with the US attorney’s office. He '
            'says by phone: “I hope the film will wake up law enforcement as '
            'far as wanting to look at it again. What bothers me at this point '
            'is: who will look into it? “No one’s going to really trust the '
            'local jurisdiction there to look into it because of, I guess, the '
            'bad feelings, the history. The federal government were recused '
            'from the situation. So I don’t know who they will get to come in '
            'and look at it and just go based on the facts. “Don’t do it with '
            'any villains involved. Just go and investigate it based on the '
            'evidence, regardless of who the suspects are. Just start from A '
            'and investigate it the proper way. All the families ask for is '
            'just do things the proper way. That’s all they want.” Earlier '
            'this year Ashley Paulk, a county sheriff in Georgia, reopened the '
            'investigation into Kendrick’s death, saying he was reviewing 17 '
            'boxes of evidence collected by federal agents that his office '
            'obtained from the US justice department. Jacqueline is sceptical '
            'of that effort but says: “I remain hopeful. I’m going to stay '
            'hopeful and I’m going to stay prayerful that one day the truth '
            'will come out.” The memory of Kendrick is with her constantly. '
            'But so is the manner of his death. If “closure”, whatever that '
            'means, is even possible, it still eludes her. “There’s no days of '
            'not thinking about him and the things that happened to him and '
            'how can people be so evil? This is eight years’ worth of pain and '
            'it is’s growing stronger and stronger every day. They say it gets '
            'easier, but it don’t.” Finding Kendrick Johnson is available to '
            'rent now in the US with a UK date to be announced',

{'article': 'Jodie Comer has said the record-breaking drama Killing Eve should '
            'end on a “good note” after the next series rather than continuing '
            'until it is “kicked out the door”. The BBC spy thriller, starring '
            'Comer as the psychopathic assassin Villanelle and Sandra Oh as '
            'British intelligence officer Eve Polastri, is approaching its '
            'fourth and final series. Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, the '
            'Liverpool-born actor, 28, admitted she tried to avoid thinking '
            'about the show’s conclusion. Comer, who received the editor’s '
            'choice award at the Harper’s Bazaar women of the year awards on '
            'Tuesday, said: “I’m trying not to think about it too much, '
            'honestly. It’s sad, you know? I’ve been with this character for a '
            'really, really long time. “I would rather we ended on a good note '
            'and kept our integrity, instead of going on and on, and being '
            'kicked out the door.” Comer said there were many layers to '
            'Villanelle : “She’s multifaceted and you can’t really pin her '
            'down. She’s instilled a sense of fearlessness in me. Through '
            'playing her, I’ve had to shed my own self-consciousness. '
            '“Villanelle’s style is loud and a little bit mismatched. She '
            'dresses for herself, which I adore. I’m happy when I’m '
            'comfortable, I want to explore fashion but ultimately, I want to '
            'feel like myself. Villanelle would probably hate me.” The actor '
            'said she hoped to appear in a science-fiction project and work '
            'with the French film director and screenwriter Julia Ducournau, '
            'who won the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes film festival. “I’d '
            'love to do some very grounded sci-fi and I really, really want to '
            'work with Julia Ducournau,” she said. “What I love about her is '
            'that she clearly has such a distinct voice and her films are so '
            'unexpected.” Killing Eve follows Oh’s Polastri as she attempts to '
            'track down and arrest Comer’s Villanelle, but as the pursuit '
            'unfolds the pair develop a mutual obsession with one another. In '
            '2018, the first season set a record for BBC iPlayer when it '
            'notched up 10.8 million requests in seven days. This record was '
            'later beaten by the television adaptation of Sally Rooney’s '
            'Normal People. Based on the Villanelle novel series by Luke '
            'Jennings, each series has been led by a different female head '
            'writer, with the first penned by the Fleabag creator, Phoebe '
            'Waller-Bridge. Emerald Fennell was head writer for season two, '
            'Suzanne Heathcote worked on season three and the fourth and final '
            'series is led by Laura Neal, who previously worked on the Netflix '
            'comedy-drama series Sex Education.',

{'article': 'Salma Hayek is dreadfully jetlagged, which is one of the perils '
            'of having homes around the world and frequently hopping between '
            'them. “Let me tell you about my craziness,” she says by video '
            'chat from her home in west London. “I’m here for less than a '
            'week, then I go back [to the US] for five days for my husband’s '
            'work, then I come back here for my work, then I go back to LA '
            'because I’m getting a star on the Hollywood Boulevard! It’s '
            'crazy,” she says. After this interview she has a fitting for '
            'dresses for various movie premieres. “We’re just making it up as '
            'we go along!” she says in exasperation at her crazy life. Despite '
            'the craziness, she looks impeccable in a Gucci dress (“As '
            'comfortable as your sweats!”), framed by the enormous mirrored '
            'painting behind her. “It’s by [Takashi] Murakami,” she says '
            'casually of one of the most expensive living artists. She blows a '
            'kiss to her husband, François-Henri Pinault, as he leaves the '
            'house. Pinault is the CEO of the fashion conglomerate Kering, '
            'which is behind labels such as Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint '
            'Laurent and many others. The Pinault family wealth is estimated '
            'at $49bn. It’s crazy. Hayek could have easily opted for the cosy, '
            'cosseted life of a mega-rich housewife. And, to be honest, there '
            'are times when she does sound a bit like one. Her favourite '
            'outfits at the moment are Balenciaga dresses: “I have four that I '
            'love,” she says. Of course, it helps that her husband owns the '
            'brand. Is she allowed to wear brands that aren’t owned by her '
            'husband? “I’m allowed to do whatever I want!” she says with mock '
            'indignation, although she adds “it’s just easier to buy the '
            '[Kering] brands. They know me there.” Yet, despite possessing a '
            'walk-in closet presumably as big as an average house, Hayek is '
            'not your average gazillionaire’s wife. By the time she met '
            'Pinault, she was 39 and a famous actor with an Oscar nomination, '
            'for 2002’s Frida. Plenty of actors before her had married wealthy '
            'men and then disappeared behind the fortress wall; Grace Kelly '
            'gave up her career to become the princess of Monaco, and Prince '
            'Rainier had a fraction of Pinault’s money. But Hayek, 55, was '
            'never going to do that. “I love what I do,” she says when I ask '
            'what motivates her to work. Plus, she says, she pays for her own '
            'expenses in her marriage: “Sometimes I struggle because I have a '
            'lot of expenses, but I like that sensation. It keeps me real,” '
            'she says solemnly. (Mind you, Hayek’s “real” is the bank balance '
            'of a Hollywood star.) This month alone, she stars in two films: '
            'the latest Marvel megamovie, Eternals, and House of Gucci, the '
            'biopic of the Gucci family. I’ve only been allowed to see '
            'Eternals, and it’s undeniably pleasing to see a female superhero '
            'older than 21 – and a deaf one, a gay one, an Asian one and a '
            'black one – among the seemingly endless Eternals heroes. That '
            'casting “feels like a miracle”, she laughs. “It has to start '
            'somewhere, and I’m glad it starts with me!” But good intentions '
            'can’t disguise that the script is a load of hooey (the Guardian '
            'gave the film two stars). I ask Hayek if she agreed to star in it '
            'because it was directed by Chloé Zhao, who won an Oscar last year '
            'for Nomadland, given she has long been a vocal supporter of '
            'female directors. “Yes, absolutely. I was in awe of her every '
            'second I was with her,” she says. “I thought, ‘Wow, I am working '
            'with a Chinese female director,’ and there’s a satisfaction in '
            'that that’s bigger than the film: it’s watching another woman be '
            'so brave, be so clever, be so inspiring.”\n'
            'Eternals is Hayek’s first superhero movie – “And I found it '
            'fascinating!” I ask why she thinks superhero movies are so '
            'popular now, but instead of making the usual economic arguments '
            '(eg they’re easier to sell to Chinese audiences than American '
            'dramas), she makes a very Hayek one: “I have a strange theory '
            'about it. It’s out there, so get ready: I think that because we '
            'only use from 3% to 10% of our brain, we know there’s a lot more '
            'to a human being that we have not discovered. So I think the '
            'superhero story makes us wonder if there’s more that we can do. '
            'That’s what they do to me anyway.” By her usual charismatic '
            'standards, Hayek is a little flat today because of the jetlag. '
            'But she warms up on subjects she cares about, so we talk a bit '
            'about Frida, her true labour of love, which she spent eight years '
            'getting made. But this, alas, leads to a subject she’s a little '
            'less fond of: Harvey Weinstein, who produced it. In 2017, Hayek '
            'wrote a blistering piece for the New York Times, detailing how he '
            'sexually harassed her for years, and how she kept saying no: “No '
            'to me taking a shower with him. No to letting him watch me take a '
            'shower. No to letting him give me a massage. No to letting a '
            'naked friend of his give me a massage. No to letting him give me '
            'oral sex. No to my getting naked with another woman. No no no no '
            'no … And with every refusal came Harvey’s Machiavellian rage.” '
            'Hayek, understandably, isn’t super-excited about rehashing this '
            'particular part of her history: “It’s so boring and old!” she '
            'groans. But when I tell her that Weinstein bullied me, got me '
            'banned from restaurants and parties and even wrote an article '
            'about me because he didn’t like things I’d written, she perks '
            'right up. “Now I want to interview you! Now, this is an '
            'interesting conversation because, if you really look at my piece, '
            'you’ll see that I really focused on the bullying [rather than the '
            'sexual harassment], and I do think women got it worse [from '
            'him].” Weinstein “is not the only man to reassure himself by '
            'knowing he can destroy women,” she says. I ask if she normalised '
            'his bullying as a way to cope with it. “To a degree. And I did '
            'feel all right [when he bullied me]. OK, I would shake '
            '[afterwards] and it did depress me, but there was a cartoon '
            'aspect about the whole thing. When he would call me up [during '
            'the making of Frida] and scream, ‘Why do you have a [monobrow] '
            'and moustache? I didn’t hire you to look ugly!’ I was like, ‘But '
            'didn’t you ever look at a picture of Frida Kahlo?’ If a man was '
            'playing Cyrano de Bergerac, he wouldn’t say, ‘What’s with the '
            'nose?’” I start to ask about her claim in the article that she '
            'thinks the reason Weinstein never assaulted her was that she was '
            'friends with Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and George '
            'Clooney, but she interrupts me. “Also I was very strong,” she '
            'says pointedly. This sounds a little like she’s suggesting some '
            'of Weinstein’s victims could be seen as weak, which seems '
            'unlikely from a woman who has done so much activism on behalf of '
            'women. So I ask if she just means she said no. “I didn’t just say '
            'no. I’m a force to be recognised,” she stresses again. “He never '
            'saw me weak. It’s not that I’m not afraid, but you’re not going '
            'to see it. I can be almost intimidating in my calm strength, you '
            'know?” When did she learn to control her fear?\n'
            '“I don’t know. Maybe animals. I have a lot of animals and I know '
            'that it’s very important they don’t smell the fear. But I don’t '
            'know.” By the way, she says, Weinstein was “not the first or last '
            'one” who treated her like that. In Hollywood or in general? “In '
            'general! We’re girls! … So you learn to be brave. It’s not easy, '
            'but you have to.” Are there men who bullied or harassed her who '
            'are still working in Hollywood? “I’m sure – it was systematic. '
            'But one of my strengths is I don’t hold a grudge,” she says, and '
            'then adds, “I also believe people can change … I’m not interested '
            'in shaming anyone. I just want it to stop.” Hayek was born and '
            'raised in Mexico, and I ask what constituted a worse problem for '
            'her in Hollywood: the harassment or the racism. “Well, it comes '
            'hand in hand. When they disrespect your background, they feel '
            'you’re weaker and they prey on weakness,” she says. A few years '
            'ago, Hayek revealed in an interview with the Guardian that the '
            'director Ivan Reitman wouldn’t even let her audition for the lead '
            'of a film because the part “wasn’t written Latin”. Which movie '
            'was that? “Ummm, the leading man was, um, Indiana Jones?” '
            'Harrison Ford? “Yes! Harrison Ford! The woman was supposed to '
            'work in the fashion business and, ironically, [Reitman] thought '
            'it wouldn’t be believable for me. It was Six Days, Seven Nights '
            'and Anne Heche got the part. And then she came out! Just before '
            'the movie was released! And they thought I wouldn’t be believable '
            '[in a romance with Ford]!” she hoots. Did she lose many parts '
            'because of her ethnicity? “So many! I’m not going to name names, '
            'but there was one part written for me, for a Mexican, and it was '
            'played by not even a Latina,” she says. And yet she was '
            'criticised for playing a Puerto Rican character on 30 Rock, I '
            'say. “Ahhh, it’s complicated because they wrote that for me. '
            'Probably if I had not done that, [that character] would not have '
            'happened. As an actress, I want to play a Puerto Rican, I want to '
            'play a Colombian, I want to play a Martian! As an actress, that '
            'is what it’s supposed to be. On the other hand, it’s good to give '
            'people opportunities. But there has to be a balance, because if '
            'we restrain people too much, everyone is going to be afraid to do '
            'anything: ‘You need a name because you need to promote the thing: '
            'oh, it’s too complicated, let’s just get a white girl.’ So we '
            'need to be realistic and to strike a balance. I’m not black and '
            'white about this, or about anything.”\n'
            'Hayek grew up in a wealthy family in Mexico, the daughter of an '
            'oil executive and an opera singer. She became hugely famous in '
            'her own country at the age of 23 when she starred in a telenovela '
            'and slowly broke into Hollywood when Rodriguez cast her in '
            'Desperado opposite Antonio Banderas. Soon after, she founded her '
            'own production company, through which she would make Ugly Betty '
            'and Frida, the film that really confirmed her as a star. From '
            'early on, she was an activist for helping women, including '
            'testifying to the US Senate to reauthorise the Violence Against '
            'Women Act and donating to women’s shelters. She also bought a '
            'ranch, which she uses as an animal sanctuary. For a long time, '
            'she assumed she would just live as a single woman with her '
            'animals, but then she met Pinault, through their mutual friend, '
            'the late designer L’Wren Scott. They have a 14-year-old daughter. '
            'Trying not to channel Mrs Merton too much, I ask what first '
            'appealed to her about mega-billionaire Pinault. “He’s like no one '
            'I ever met before,” she says, clearly relishing the subject. '
            '“He’s a fascinating man and it’s been 16 years and I’m still '
            'fascinated by him. I’d met amazing men, but I don’t know if '
            'anybody saw me as clearly as him. And I know who he is. Something '
            'about his soul, I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s pure.” '
            'During lockdown, Hayek got dangerously ill with Covid, but '
            'refused to go to hospital, preferring to stay home. “It was '
            'terrifying. But it was also kind of lovely to be in the house '
            'with him, who is my rock,” she says. She was 41 when their '
            'daughter, Valentina, was born and I ask what the upsides are to '
            'being an older mother. “You appreciate it so much more because, '
            'by the time you get there, you’ve been through the fear of maybe '
            'it might never happen. Also you know what you want to do with '
            'your life, so you don’t have the pressure of: ‘What am I going to '
            'do with my life? And I’m a mother!’ When you marry young, it’s '
            'hard because maybe you don’t know who you are yet. I was a little '
            'bit wiser,” she says. And as she heads off for more fittings for '
            'her upcoming premieres, Murakami twinkling over her shoulder, who '
            'would disagree? Eternals is in cinemas from 5 November. House of '
            'Gucci is released on 26 November.',

{'article': 'Streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, online '
            'newspapers, ebooks and items reserved online but picked up in '
            'stores could be subject to a new online sales tax if ministers '
            'give it the green light. In a long-anticipated final report on a '
            'review of business rates the Treasury said it would shortly '
            'launch a consultation on a new tax for online goods and services '
            'which was expected to conclude next year. Should an online sales '
            'tax be pursued, the report said “design choices” would need to be '
            'made on what should be taxable, including digital products, sales '
            'agreed via email or instant message, and essentials such as most '
            'foods, medicines and children’s clothes, which currently do not '
            'attract VAT. But the consultation added that it was likely any '
            'extra cost of such a tax would be passed on to consumers at a '
            'high rate, suggesting it would be “regressive” – or borne more '
            'heavily by low-income households. Publication of the detailed '
            'review comes after the government announced at the budget last '
            'week it would “explore the arguments for and against” an online '
            'sales tax that could fund a reduction in business rates for high '
            'street retailers. The report said a new tax set at 1% to 2% would '
            'not raise enough money to replace business rates, but could “help '
            'to rebalance the tax burden between bricks and mortar shops and '
            'online retail”. Despite widespread calls from the retail and '
            'hospitality industries, who partly blame hefty business rates '
            'bills for mass closures on the British high street, the report '
            'said there was no case for a fundamental revamp of the property '
            'tax which brings in £25bn a year. The government review said: '
            '“The evidence provided has not established that the business '
            'rates system is responsible for the shift to online or for '
            'broader problems on the high street. Other factors that may be '
            'relevant include changing consumer preferences, improvement in '
            'the choice and convenience available to online shoppers, and '
            'differences in the amount of stock that physical stores carry as '
            'compared with online retailers.” Store owners say they are '
            'disadvantaged by paying higher taxes than online specialists such '
            'as Amazon, Boohoo and Asos who divert shoppers away from local '
            'thoroughfares. Labour last month pledged to scrap business rates '
            'and undertake the “biggest overhaul of business taxation in a '
            'generation” if it was voted in at the next election.\n'
            'In his budget speech last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said '
            'he would help small retail and hospitality businesses with a '
            'temporary 50% cut. However, industry groups said the cut, which '
            'is capped at £110,000 per business and will last a year, would '
            'only benefit small retailers, bars and restaurants and pubs, '
            'because larger shops such as a single department store can pay '
            'more than £1m a year in rates. The cancellation of next year’s '

            '£1bn to bills, according to analysts at the real estate adviser '
            'Altus, and of which a quarter would have been paid by retailers – '

{'article': 'In some respects, preventing climate breakdown is highly '
            'complicated. But in another, it’s really simple: we need to leave '
            'fossil fuels in the ground. All the bluster and grandstanding, '
            'the extravagant promises and detailed mechanisms discussed in '
            'Glasgow this week amount to nothing if this simple and obvious '
            'thing doesn’t happen. A recent study in the scientific journal '
            'Nature suggests that to stand a 50% chance of avoiding more than '
            '1.5C of global heating, we need to retire 89% of proven coal '
            'reserves, 58% of oil reserves and 59% of fossil methane (“natural '
            'gas”) reserves. If we want better odds than 50-50, we’ll need to '
            'leave almost all of them untouched. Yet most governments with '
            'major reserves are determined to make the wrong choice. As the '
            'latest production gap report by the UN and academic researchers '
            'shows, over the next two decades, unless there’s a rapid and '
            'drastic change in policy, coal is likely to decline a little, but '
            'oil and gas production will keep growing. By 2030, governments '
            'are planning to extract 110% more fossil fuels than their Paris '
            'agreement pledge (“limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above '
            'pre-industrial levels”) would permit. Even nations that claim to '
            'be leading the transition mean to keep drilling. In the US, Joe '
            'Biden promised to pause all new leases for oil and gas on public '
            'lands and in offshore waters. His government was sued by 14 '
            'Republican states. Though climate campaigners argue that Biden '
            'has many other tools for preventing such leases from being '
            'issued, he immediately folded, and his government has now begun '
            'the process of auctioning drilling rights in Alaskan waters and '
            'the Gulf of Mexico. It’s just the kind of weakness the '
            'Republicans were hoping to exploit. Germany has promised to phase '
            'out coal production by 2038 (far too late, by the way). Yet it is '
            'still developing new deposits. For example, the village of '
            'Lützerath in North Rhine-Westphalia, which sits above a thick '
            'seam of the filthiest kind of coal – lignite – is currently being '
            'destroyed. But if Germany abides by its own rule, the mine will '
            'need to be abandoned before it reaches full production. So either '
            'homes and forests are being trashed for no reason, or the German '
            'government doesn’t intend to honour its promise. In the UK, the '
            'government still insists on what it calls “maximising economic '
            'recovery” of oil and gas. Last year, it offered 113 new licences '
            'to explore offshore reserves. It aims at least to double the '
            'amount of fossil fuels that are ready to be exploited here. Every '
            'speech and pledge and gesture at Glasgow this week is '
            'thistledown, by comparison to the hard facts of new coalmines, '
            'oil and gas fields. It’s the mining and drilling that counts: the '
            'rest is distraction. But distraction is big business. The oil '
            'corporations have spent many millions of dollars on ads, memes '
            'and films to convince us they’ve gone green. But the latest '
            'report on this issue by the International Energy Agency reveals '
            'that in 2020 “clean energy investments by the oil and gas '
            'industry accounted for only around 1% of total capital '
            'expenditure”. Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 '
            'largest banks have poured $3.8tn into fossil fuel companies. '
            'People in rich nations seek to blame climate breakdown on India '
            'and China, which continue to develop new coal plants. But an '
            'estimated 40% of the “committed emissions” for the Asian coal '
            'plants sampled by researchers can be attributed to banks and '
            'investors in Europe and the US. Even if guilt were to be '
            'apportioned by nationality – a preposterous notion in a world '
            'where money moves freely and power is wielded across borders – we '
            'could not detach ourselves from these decisions. There’s scarcely '
            'a fossil fuel project on Earth that has not been facilitated by '
            'public money. In 2020, according to the International Monetary '
            'Fund, governments spent $450bn in direct subsidies for the fossil '
            'fuel industry. The IMF accounts the other costs the industry '
            'imposes on us – pollution, destruction and climate chaos – at '
            '$5.5tn. But I find such figures meaningless: dollars can’t '
            'capture the loss of human life and the trashing of ecosystems, '
            'let alone the prospect of systemic environmental collapse. One in '
            'five of all deaths, according to a recent estimate, are now '
            'caused by fossil fuel pollution. Public finance corporations are '
            'still pouring money into coal, oil and gas: in the past three '
            'years, G20 governments and multinational development banks '
            'outrageously spent two and a half times as much money on '
            'international finance for fossil fuels as they did on renewables. '
            'On one account, 93% of the world’s coal plants are protected from '
            'market forces by special government contracts and uncompetitive '
            'tariffs. The UK has reduced its petroleum revenue tax for '
            'companies drilling for oil to zero. As a result, our oilfields '
            'are likely soon to cost the exchequer more money than it gains. '
            'What’s the point? For just $161bn – a fraction of the money '
            'governments spend on supporting fossil fuels – they could buy out '
            'and shut down every coal plant on Earth. If they did so as part '
            'of a just transition, they would create more employment than they '
            'destroy. For example, research by Oil Change International '
            'suggests the UK could generate three jobs in clean energy for '
            'every one lost from oil and gas. Everything about the '
            'relationship between nation states and the fossil fuel industry '
            'is perverse, stupid and self-destructive. For the sake of this '
            'dirty industry’s profits and dividends – overwhelmingly '
            'concentrated among a tiny number of the world’s people – '
            'governments commit us to catastrophe. All over the world, people '
            'are mobilising to change this, and their voices need to be heard '
            'in Glasgow. The campaign to create a fossil fuel '
            'non-proliferation treaty has gathered the signatures of thousands '
            'of scientists and more than 100 Nobel laureates. Europe Beyond '
            'Coal is bringing together movements across the continent to stop '
            'new mines and close existing ones. The visionary governments of '
            'Denmark and Costa Rica have founded the Beyond Oil and Gas '
            'Alliance. We should pressure our governments to join it. And yes, '
            'it really is this simple. We have the technology required to '
            'replace fossil fuels. There’s plenty of money, which is currently '
            'being squandered on the destruction of life on Earth. The '
            'transition could take place in months, if governments willed it. '
            'The only thing that stands in the way is the power of legacy '
            'industries and the people who profit from them. This is what '
            'needs to be overthrown. The handwaving, the complexity, the '
            'grandiloquent distraction in Glasgow are designed above all for '
            'one purpose: not to accelerate this transition, but to thwart it. '

            'proportions (in ballet, small head, long legs, short torso, high '
            'insteps). And also, it’s hairless. As with swimmers, athletes, '
            'gymnasts and others who wear leotards for a living, constant '
            'depilation is part of the job. That goes for men as well as '
            'women. “I choose to shave because it gives me a sense of '
            'readiness,” says dancer and choreographer Eliot Smith. “I believe '
            'it gives me better outlines of the body against the stage '
            'lights.” On ballet message boards, it’s not uncommon to find '
            'parents of teenage boys asking what to do about hairy legs '
            'showing under white tights (wear two pairs of tights, or paint '
            'over hairs with pancake are two suggestions, if shaving isn’t an '
            'option). But is there an alternative? When pole dancer Leila '
            'Davis was pictured in an Adidas campaign in March showing off '
            'armpit fuzz, as well as toned abs, there were plenty of online '
            'haters, predictably, but lots of lovers, too. And there are a few '
            '– although not many – contemporary dancers who are happy to let '
            'their body hair be seen on stage. “I want it to be normalised,” '
            'says Jessie Roberts-Smith, a performer with Scottish Dance '
            'Theatre. And independent choreographer Ellie Sikorski sees it as '
            'part of a bigger picture. “It’s not the first fight I would pick '
            'about the homogeneity of bodies on stage,” she says. “But there’s '
            'something archaic in dance – where your body is policed in '
            'certain ways. You’re taught not to have agency over your body and '
            'body hair is a tiny detail of that.”\n'
            'In ballet, land of smooth, clean lines and impossible perfection, '
            'it’s hard to imagine unkempt hairs sprouting up on stage any time '
            'soon. “In classical ballet you’re never going to see a beautiful '
            'tutu princess with loads of armpit hair,” laughs Nancy '
            'Osbaldeston, a principal with Ballet Vlaanderen in Antwerp, who '
            'fits in leg shaving and Brazilian waxes around her performance '
            'schedule. She recently danced Palmos, a ballet of bare legs and '
            'high-cut leotards by Andonis Foniadakis. “There were definitely '
            'some crotchy moments,” she recalls.\n'
            'In fact, Osbaldeston thinks hair removal is so much part of the '
            'job that dancers might be able to claim it as an expense. “I '
            'think someone did tell me that if you have a good accountant to '
            'do your taxes, you can write it off,” she says. When Osbaldeston '
            'danced with English National Ballet, she remembers a woman coming '
            'in once and waxing everyone in turn as a job lot. Begoña Cao, '
            'winner of a National Dance award, had a similar experience. “We’d '
            'put a mat down and lock the door.” Laser removal is popular as '
            'well. “I like to be tidy,” adds Cao. “The thought never crossed '
            'my mind to not take it off. If you have a tutu on, the audience '
            'from further out can’t see anything. But you’ve got your '
            'colleagues and people in the wings and those ballet fanatics that '
            'have their binoculars!”\n'
            'Outside ballet, though, there are some hairs peeking through, in '
            'line with a wider cultural shift among Gen Z-ers happy to show '
            'off their armpits au naturel on Instagram, or even dye their body '
            'hair. And then there’s the beauty brand Billie, which advertises '
            'razors with pictures of models and their proudly furry bikini '
            'lines. “I do feel like we’re getting more into a world where both '
            'are normal,” says Roberts-Smith, who is 26 and leaves her hair as '
            'it is, which is fine by Scottish Dance Theatre. “I don’t even '
            'think about it any more. I’m lucky to be in a company that '
            'embraces different shapes and sizes and hairless and hairy. It '
            'needs to be happening. For me, it is one of the most profound '
            'inequalities between men and women, that we have been removing '
            'parts of ourselves for such a long time, and that’s just deemed '
            'normal by society. It’s bonkers when you think about it, '
            'absolutely bananas.” Obviously, men do shave their faces, but '
            'it’s the sense of disgust attached to women’s hair that’s so '
            'gendered. “There’s all this deep-seated stuff about cleanliness, '
            'which just isn’t true,” says Roberts-Smith. Sikorski, 33, stopped '
            'shaving her legs at 17. “Because, I suppose, I discovered that '
            'was possible,” she says, and because shaving irritated her skin. '
            'She’s more likely to get a reaction now on the tube than on stage '
            '– she’s had people take pictures of her when she’s been holding '
            'on to an overhead support. There’s a hierarchy of hirsuteness, '
            'though. Sikorski remembers that, in one of the first pieces she '
            'made, she wore a swimming costume. “I had hairy legs, hairy '
            'armpits, but I plucked my bikini line.” “I think the bikini line '
            'is still a no-no,” says Robert-Smith, with regard to the move '
            'towards letting it all hang out – although she has a leotard '
            'piece coming up and isn’t planning to buy any Veet.\n'
            'There are plenty more hair-related issues – most seriously, the '
            'dancers with afro hair who are told flat-out that it’s not '
            'appropriate for ballet. French dancer Marie-Astrid Mence talked '
            'about this in the film Pointe Black last year. The vagaries of '
            'personal grooming may seem trifling by contrast. But the '
            'discrimination against afro hair is changing, according to '
            'Northern Ballet’s dancer Aerys Merrill, who’s heard those '
            'stories, but hasn’t experienced negative comments about her own '
            'afro hair. In the US, she danced Clara in The Nutcracker with her '
            'natural hair proudly on show. “Some companies are more accepting; '
            'some companies want it to be extremely uniform, with the same '
            'slicked-back look,” she says. Like Merrill, 17-year-old Taïs '
            'Vinolo, who appeared in Amazon’s The Show Must Go On advert last '
            'Christmas, used to straighten her hair. “I didn’t feel '
            'comfortable with my own hair until two or three years ago,” she '
            'says. Now she’s wondering if we’ll see ballet dancers with '
            'braided hair on stage. “I hope it’s going to happen. I’m pretty '
            'sure we are close to it,” she says, but adds that as a young '
            'pre-professional dancer, “I am scared to approach that subject '
            'with my teachers.”\n'
            'Some choreographers actively incorporate (head) hair into their '
            'choreography, Pina Bausch being the queen of long flowing locks, '
            'whether swooping around the dancer like an extra limb in 2006’s '
            'Vollmond or being used to whip the cruel Bluebeard in her 1977 '
            'version of the folk tale. Osbaldeston says she missed out on '
            'being cast once because she had short hair and the choreographer '
            'wanted it long and swishy. Choreographers have a vision in mind – '
            'and that includes facial hair. Sikorski knows of a male dancer '
            'who has lost jobs because he won’t shave his beard off. Smith has '
            'become more relaxed about his own facial hair, he tells me, in '
            'line with a general shift across the industry that includes '
            'dancers having visible tattoos. As an artistic director he has an '
            'open mind, he says, but expects the dancers to look “presentable” '
            'and be open to what’s needed for a particular character. “I guess '
            'it’s a question of whether ballet is a personal expression or '
            'whether a choreographer has the final say over how you look,” '
            'says dancer James Forbat who, incidentally, shaves his chest and '
            'leg hair out of choice for performances, but has never explicitly '
            'been asked to.\n'
            'Sikorski raises a similar point. Do you see a body as an abstract '
            'tool to create visual art, or a person who can’t be separated '
            'from what they’re doing? “People think you can abstract a body, '
            'and I fundamentally think you can’t, and shouldn’t,” she says. '
            '“That’s where I differ with a lot of people in the dance world.” '
            'All these dancers agree on one thing, though: each to their own, '
            'everyone’s personal choice should be respected. But the decision '
            'to shave and wax, or wear your hair straightened or natural, '
            'inevitably reflects the values of their art forms as well as the '
            'wider culture at large. Osbaldeston doesn’t think any of her '
            'female colleagues will stop shaving their armpits soon. “I would '
            'feel bad for partnering, if a boy was holding you under your '
            'arms,” she says. “But they have hair there too,” she muses, “so I '
            'don’t know the difference really.”',

{'article': 'What happens if you reverse engineer the raw materials of '
            'everyday objects such as an iPhone, a Starbucks cup or a bicycle? '
            'Lonneke Gordijn and Ralph Nauta of the Dutch art collective '
            'Studio Drift attempted to find out by stripping back the elements '
            'and depicting them proportionately in cubes and prisms. Titled '
            'Materialism, their show at the New York event space the Shed asks '
            'viewers to put aside culturally constructed ideas of various '
            'chemicals and view the objects with a renewed sense of wonder. '
            'Materialism is presented within another show, Fragile Future, '
            'that is equally enamored with the material world, finding a '
            'certain grace in enormous blocks of concrete. Fragile Future’s '
            'five minivan-sized concrete blocks (“Drifters”) appear to float '
            'through the air, rotating and performing feats of choreography '
            'that start out free-form before tracing specific shapes around '
            'the viewer. It’s set to music composed by Anohni, an artist long '
            'preoccupied by questions of human ecology. Nauta describes the '
            'pieces in Materialism as “deconstructions of everyday objects '
            'that we find interesting”. By nudging us to remember that iPhones '
            'contain elements like nickel that are environmentally destructive '
            'to mine – along with trace quantities of cobalt and tungsten, '
            'which have been linked to conflict mining – Studio Drift wants us '
            'to realize the connections between consumer goods and the '
            'societies that create them. In a less world-historical sense, '
            'phones themselves have changed a great deal. Comparing the '
            'components of an iPhone 4S with those in a now obsolete Nokia '
            '3210, Nauta observes that the shift has been enormous in barely '
            '20 years. The Nokia’s main component is the circuitry of an '
            'actual telephone, whereas with iPhones, the biggest chunk is '
            'specially developed glass.\n'
            'The iPhone 4S is made of specially developed glass along with '
            'steel, polycarbonate, graphite, copper, nickel, and a range of '
            'other materials.\n'
            'The Nokia 3210 includes polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene '
            'styrene, nylon and aluminum. Its main component is the circuitry '
            'of an actual telephone. “At first, the function was more '
            'important,” Nauta says of early-aughts phones. “The screen was '
            'minimal. The connection was more important, but now it’s the '
            'visual connection. There are a lot of details: the cobalt, the '
            'mercury, the nickel, which comes from certain mines. We’re going '
            'deeper into that for our next project, putting in an augmented '
            'layer where you can actually dive into the object and find more '
            'about the materials.”\n'
            'A Nokia 3210. Apple claims to have phased out mercury in its '
            'products in 2009, but in Materialism’s breakdown of a Nokia – a '
            'company that once attempted to manufacture a tablet called '
            'Mercury – a spongy, kelly-green prism jumps out from the mostly '
            'transparent or grayscale. In this context, it looks eerie, almost '
            'radioactive. The show’s spookiest piece might be the Internet, a '
            'single, dark-gray block. It’s silicon, Nauta says. Using the '
            'time-honored principle of E = MC2, he calculated the weight of '
            'all the electrons running through the internet on a specific date '
            'in 2020. The total? About 60kg, up from 25 grams not so long '
            'before. Many of these prisms are representations of the '
            'materials, not the materials themselves. This owes less to '
            'toxicity than to the fussy properties of some materials at room '
            'temperature, or their cost.\n'
            'The internet of 2020 is represented by a large block indicating '
            'the weight of all the electrons running through it, with a much '
            'smaller block showing how it appeared in 2000. Nauta says the '
            'ratios on display are more important. Take the Big Mac Menu, for '
            'example. “We kept it recognizable,” he says. “We could have gone '
            'to a molecular level, but with this, we thought you can still '
            'point out the fries, the sugar, the salt, the saturated fats, the '
            'pickle, the straw. It’s interesting, because people do recognize '
            'it and get all of the blocks correct. So we have a logic in our '
            'minds that sees this hamburger and understands the size of the '
            'block that should be for the pickle, which I find fascinating.”\n'
            'The Big Mac Menu features water, bread, fries, Coke, fat, meat '
            'and other ingredients that ‘people do recognize’, Nauta says. '
            'Like the human body itself, the Starbucks Cup is mostly water. '
            'Nauta says that when he pays $5 for a cup of tea, he feels like '
            'someone screwed him over, but when he gets coffee with milk in '
            'it, he feels like it’s worth it. (“But it’s the same amount of '
            'water you’re buying!” he says.)\n'
            'The Starbucks Cup is mostly water, but also contains paper, '
            'coffee, wood and polystyrene. Once deconstructed, this poses all '
            'sorts of questions about how arbitrary human economics can be, '
            'from quirks of the human palate to the fact that the global '
            'coffee industry appears consumed with questions of fair-labor '
            'practices far more than tea is. The more processed an item is, '
            'the harder it becomes for our minds to process.\n'
            'An AK-47. Geopolitics shows up in several pieces, namely the M16 '
            'and the AK-47. The AK-47, one of the best-known Soviet exports, '
            'has become a totem of rightwing American ideas of liberty – it’s '
            'a sort of cold war narrative in miniature. This humble '
            'Kalashnikov, Nauta says, is a $500 tool whose bullets are steel. '
            'By contrast, the M16 is practically a luxury good.\n'
            'The AK-47 consists of birch wood, steel, paint and other '
            'materials, while the bullet contains steel, smokeless powder, '
            'lead and more – as compared with the high-grade polymer and '
            'nickel bullets of the M16, Nauta says. “The AK is made with wood, '
            'but in the States, it’s this high-grade polymer that’s '
            'specifically developed for the M16 that makes these weapons tens '
            'of thousands of dollars, and the bullets are made out of nickel,” '
            'he says. “These different war machines – why do they function in '
            'a certain way?” Then there’s the Bike, as much a symbol of the '
            'Netherlands as the tulip. Unlike the smartphone, it’s something '
            'most people can dismantle and fix in their garage. And yet even '
            'an analog technology can, when reduced to its essence, renew a '
            'sense of wonder.\n'
            'The bike, which, unlike the smartphone, is something people can '
            'dismantle themselves, is made of rubber, polyurethane foam, '
            'steel, aluminum and other materials. “When it rains here, or it’s '
            '-15C here, everyone’s still on their bike,” Nauta says. '
            '“Everybody knows how to repair their tire or put a chain back on '
            'their bike. In Amsterdam, you go through three a year, and it '
            'becomes this piece of mechanics that’s just a part of your life. '
            'Still, all these things that you collect, it’s impossible to '
            'process. We live in a very strange world.” Fragile Future is at '
            'the Shed until 19 December',

{'article': 'NHS mobile test-and-trace units run by Mitie are cutting the '
            'guaranteed pay of workers by a third after winning a new contract '
            'from the government. The outsourcing firm, which employs about '
            '1,000 people at mobile testing sites, has told workers that from '
            '8 November they will be guaranteed pay for an eight-hour shift '
            'each day, rather than 12 hours, slashing secure pay to £80 a day '
            'from £120. Workers previously received the £120 no matter how '
            'many hours they worked, they will now receive extra pay only if '
            'they work more than eight hours. Workers said the pay change came '
            'amid a surge in demand for their services with some sites dealing '
            'with more than 600 people in a day. One worker said some '
            'supervisors were so busy they did not have time for the '
            'regulation half-hour break.\n'
            'Another said the mobile test-and-trace workers had suffered “a '
            'huge blow to morale” because of the pay changes that are hitting '
            'shortly before Christmas. “Personally, I feel betrayed and seen '
            'as disposable by Mitie. The changes mean that everyone will be '
            'losing hundreds of pounds in earnings each month, with those who '
            'live the closest to and furthest from our sites losing '
            'significantly more with the new mileage proposals. “The bumbling '
            'way Mitie have handed this and their poor communication to '

            'of some workers by up to 5% in the light of a new government '
            'contract that specifies they should receive the real living wage. '
            'Some G4S workers were told their hourly pay rate would drop from '

{'article': 'The disruption from the climate emergency being experienced by '
            'marine wildlife reached a new high in the first week of Cop26, '
            'when a female walrus was discovered sleeping on a submarine in a '
            'naval base in North Holland. Walruses normally live in the polar '
            'regions – several hundred miles north. This particular animal is '
            'one of at least two of the species that have been seen far from '
            'their Arctic habitat. Another wandering walrus, seen off the '
            'Scilly Islands, France, Spain and West Cork, Ireland, has since '
            'been sighted back in Icelandic waters. Freya, as the animal has '
            'been named, is the first of her species to visit the Netherlands '
            'in 23 years. She was spotted snoozing on a submarine in the naval '
            'port of Den Helder by Jeroen Hoekendijk, a Dutch scientist '
            'specialising in marine mammals.\n'
            'She appears to be in good health, although Hoekendijk – who '
            'observed the animal feeding on razor clams earlier – noted a raw '
            'wound in her front flippers. She is thought to have swum south, '
            'following the Danish and German coasts. (Suggestions that she or '
            'the ‘Irish’ walrus might have been cast adrift on a broken ice '
            'floe were widely ridiculed by marine scientists.) Hoekendijk was '
            'instructed that he wasn’t allowed to board the vessel to '
            'photograph the animal, only to be told; ‘But you can walk on it.’ '
            'He also noted that the vessel happens to be a ‘Walrus-class '
            'submarine’ – and is named Zr. Ms. Dolfijn. Social media users '
            'quipped that the Arctic mammal showed an “excellent example of '
            'animal-initiated civil resistance”, and that “considering '
            'military are huge contributors to carbon emissions, the walrus is '
            'probably protesting climate justice”. Others, however, thought it '
            'was very nice of the Dutch navy not to kick the walrus off their '
            'boat.\n'
            'But walruses are not just recent visitors to these southern '
            'waters. In 1456, William Caxton, the medieval chronicler and '
            'printer, recorded a walrus in the Thames (along with a swordfish '
            'and 20 whales). Caxton warned that the beast’s appearance was a '
            'sign of trouble to come. Although that might have been for the '
            'walruses themselves, since they were slaughtered for their thick '
            'hide, which was made into ropes, and for their tusks, which were '
            'carved into ivory objects such as the famous Lewis chess pieces. '
            'And five hundred years ago this year, in 1521, the Renaissance '
            'artist Albrecht Dürer, a great chronicler of the natural world, '
            'drew perhaps the first modern image of a walrus, said to have '
            'been stranded in ‘Netherlandish waters’. The sepia drawing goes '
            'on show in a major exhibition of Dürer’s work at the National '
            'Gallery in London later this month.',

{'article': 'As world leaders inside the Cop26 conference centre in Glasgow '
            'boasted about pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions and end '
            'deforestation, indigenous delegates gathered across the river '
            'Clyde to commemorate activists killed for trying to protect the '
            'planet from corporate greed and government inaction. At least '
            '1,005 environmental and land rights defenders have been murdered '
            'since the Paris accords were signed six years ago, according to '
            'the international non-profit Global Witness. One in three of '
            'those killed were indigenous people. The dead include Berta '
            'Cáceres, winner of the prestigious Goldman prize for '
            'environmental defenders, who was shot dead at her home in '
            'Honduras in March 2016 for opposing the construction of an '
            'internationally financed dam on a river considered sacred by her '
            'Lenca people. As the names of the murdered defenders were '
            'projected on a large outdoor screen, indigenous activists from '
            'Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and the Philippines implored political '
            'leaders to listen to their struggles. “The Cop is a big business, '
            'a continuation of colonialism where people come not to listen to '
            'us, but to make money from our land and natural resources,” said '
            'Ita Mendoza, 46, an indigenous land defender from the Mixteca '
            'region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, attending Cop for the first '
            'time. “What benefits does the Cop bring when more than a thousand '
            'people fighting to keep the planet alive have been killed [since '
            'Paris]?” Mendoza is part of the Futuros Indigenas (Indigenous '
            'Futures) collective from Mexico, who spent months crowdfunding to '
            'be able to attend Cop26 so their communities’ struggles and '
            'vision for protecting the planet might be heard. The collective '
            'did not get accreditation for the full two weeks, and as Cop '
            'first-timers are struggling to navigate the bureaucracy and '
            'structural barriers to their participation.\n'
            'Still, at least they made it. About two-thirds of civil society '
            'organizations who usually attend Cop could not come to Glasgow '
            'due to a combination of visa and accreditation problems, lack of '
            'access to Covid-19 vaccines and changing travel rules. Mostly '
            'absent are those from the global south – poorer, less '
            'industrialized nations who have contributed least to greenhouse '
            'gas emissions but are disproportionately harmed by increasingly '
            'intense extreme weather events linked to global heating such as '
            'drought, storms and floods. Their voices will be missed during '
            'the negotiations, but the problems run much deeper, according to '
            'multiple veteran Cop participants. In the 50 years since Cop '
            'began, international climate policies have mostly ignored or '
            'violated the cultural and territorial rights of indigenous '
            'peoples – despite them being recognized in 2001 as a formal '
            'constituency, one of nine broad thematic clusters (that also '
            'include business groups, environmental NGOs, women and youth '
            'groups and trade unions) permitted to observe and lobby '
            'negotiators.\n'
            'Then in 2015, the Paris accords legally recognized the crucial '
            'role of traditional knowledge and innovations by local '
            'communities and indigenous peoples in understanding and tackling '
            'the climate crisis. The move was meant to ensure they could '
            'participate and influence international climate policies in a '
            'more meaningful and equal way. But six years on, indigenous '
            'people interviewed by the Guardian say little has changed inside '
            'the UN-led negotiations, while outside environmental destruction '
            'continues unchecked in their communities and the impact of the '
            'climate crisis is getting worse. “Indigenous people are more '
            'visible but we’re not taken any more seriously; we’re '
            'romanticized and tokenized,” said Eriel Deranger, executive '
            'director of Indigenous Climate Action and member of the '
            'facilitated working group for North America, part of the new UN '
            'structures established after Paris. “They’re trying to collect '
            'and preserve indigenous knowledge while continuing to leave us '
            'out of the actual decision-making and positions of power. It’s '
            'the only lever we have to hold states and governments '
            'accountable, but it’s the same paternalistic system as ever. '
            'We’re set up to fail, so that’s where civil society must come '
            'in.”\n'
            'Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the North American '
            'Indigenous Environmental Network, who’s attended every Cop since '
            '1998, said indigenous knowledge holders were being “co-opted and '
            'manipulated by the Eurocentric UN system”. This week, it was '
            'announced that $1.7bn will be given to indigenous peoples and '
            'local communities in recognition of their key role in protecting '
            'the planet’s lands and forests. Net-zero targets, the central '
            'theme of Cop26, revolve around incentivizing carbon capture '
            'markets through mass reforestation, biofuels and new technologies '
            '– which many indigenous leaders see as false climate solutions '
            'that will lead to further land grabs and environmental and '
            'cultural destruction. For them, keeping fossil fuels and minerals '
            'in the ground is the only way to curtail global heating and its '
            'devastating impacts. Chief Ninawa Inu Huni Kui, president of the '
            'Huni Kui People’s Federation of the Brazilian Amazon, added: “Our '
            'vision is very different to those who make the decisions at Cop. '
            'We have ancestral connections to the environment and Mother '
            'Earth. These are spiritual spaces that we would never negotiate '
            'or offset for money, but the working groups don’t represent the '
            'views of our communities or explain what these carbon markets '
            'actually mean.”\n'
            'As the climate crisis intensifies with record floods, fires and '
            'heatwaves across the world, so does the violence against '
            'defenders. 2020 was the deadliest year on record for '
            'environmental and land defenders, with indigenous people '
            'accounting for half of the total 227 killed. Many, like Cáceres, '
            'had been resisting environmentally destructive extractive '
            'industries and energy projects including pipelines, dams, '
            'industrial wind and solar farms, and African palm plantations. '
            'Still, indigenous peoples have survived against the odds, and '
            'they are not giving up. “It’s a testament of our resilience that '
            'even after hundreds of years of colonization and betrayal that we '
            'indigenous communities are still willing to sacrifice our lives, '
            'health and energy for this last-ditch attempt to save the '

            'built on colonialism and repression. It’s up to them if they '

{'article': 'It is a sign of the confusion surrounding the Bank of England’s '
            'interest rate decision on Thursday that investors are unusually '
            'divided over which direction the central bank will go. Financial '
            'markets show that more than six in 10 investors are anticipating '
            'a hike in the cost of borrowing while a majority of City '
            'economists take the opposite view, telling a Reuters survey they '
            'expect rates will remain at historic lows, at least for the time '
            'being.\n'
            'In a big week for central banks, America’s Federal Reserve will '
            'today make its much more clearly signposted announcement on '
            'tapering the scale of its monthly stimulus package, though '
            'interest rates are expected to remain unchanged. Which way the '
            'BoE will swing, even at the 11th hour, is anyone’s guess. Ahead '
            'of one of the most finely balanced monetary policy (MPC) meetings '
            'in a decade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s gauge of interest '
            'rate futures, known as BoE Watch, has stated there is a 100% '
            'likelihood of a rate rise in the UK this week. The views of City '
            'economists chime with MPC members Silvana Tenreyro and Catherine '
            'Mann, who have aired fears that an interest rate rise now could '
            'threaten a recovery that is already weakening. Governor Andrew '
            'Bailey, his chief economist Huw Pill and Michael Saunders, the '
            'former Citibank economist, have argued in speeches and comments '
            'that swift action could be needed to quell rising prices, swaying '
            'opinion in financial markets in favour of the BoE being the first '
            'major central bank to tighten policy. Bailey’s remark that the '
            'bank “will have to act and must do so if we see a risk, '
            'particularly to medium-term inflation” caught the eye of many '
            'investment funds seeking to hedge against rates going up. Deputy '
            'governor Sir Dave Ramsden is also believed to be in favour of '
            'Threadneedle Street pushing rates from historic lows after he '
            'voted with Saunders at the last MPC meeting to stop quantitative '
            'easing (QE) in its tracks ahead of a planned cut off date in '
            'December. QE is the second strand of the BoE’s stimulus programme '
            'and was ramped up by £250bn to £895bn after the pandemic hit. If '
            'four members of the committee have signed up to higher rates, it '
            'only takes one more to tip the scales. That puts another deputy '
            'governor, Ben Broadbent, in the frame, since the former Goldman '
            'Sachs economist has never voted against the governor in his seven '
            'years on the MPC. Deutsche bank economists Sanjay Raja and Panos '
            'Giannopoulos said after Bailey’s intervention that they were '
            'changing their view and that the BoE would “deliver its first '
            'post-pandemic rate hike of 0.15%”, adding: “We also expect the '
            'MPC to end its current QE programme – one month earlier than '
            'expected, trimming £20bn from QE.” Pride will be the deciding '
            'factor, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities. '
            '“Disappointing [markets] now, we think, would be Bailey’s least '
            'preferred option,” they said, though they conceded a rate rise '
            'was not a done deal. The confusion surrounding the outcome of '
            'Thursday’s meeting stems from the wide range of often '
            'contradictory data that has emerged in recent months. After '
            'Britain suffered its worst slump in the postwar era in March '
            '2020, it has bounced back strongly this year. Job vacancy rates '
            'have spiralled higher and wages, which fell sharply last year, '
            'have recovered. Inflation, after dropping to almost zero earlier '
            'this year, has climbed since the spring above the BoE’s target '
            'level of 2% to 3.1%. At the MPC’s last meeting, it said rates '
            'would most likely need to rise by 0.5% next year to help bring '
            'down inflation to 2% over the next three years, though the '
            'minutes show it cautioned against early action. “All members '
            'agreed the outlook for the labour market, and hence underlying '
            'inflationary pressures, was particularly uncertain.” David '
            'Blanchflower, the Ivy League economics professor and former MPC '
            'member, said the committee should ask itself how much of the '
            'pandemic dust had cleared. “The furlough scheme has only just '
            'ended, consumer confidence is sliding backwards and businesses '
            'are nervous about the future. How can they say the economy is '
            'strong enough to cope with more expensive credit? If anything the '
            'indicators show the economy is weakening, which means that an '
            'interest rate rise would be a colossal mistake.” The other major '
            'central banks are a long way from raising rates. The Federal '
            'Reserve has held rates at near zero since the start of the '
            'pandemic and plans to continue adding to a $8.5tn QE programme, '
            'albeit at a slower pace.\n'
            'The European central bank has pledged to maintain its policy of '
            'negative interest rates and boost QE for the foreseeable future '
            'while the Bank of Japan said last week that it plans to redouble '
            'its efforts to stimulate a lacklustre recovery in the world’s '
            'third-largest economy. Ana Boata, head of economic research at '
            'credit insurer Euler Hermes, said Bailey’s comments “have pushed '
            'the BoE into a corner”. She believes a rate rise now could push '
            'the UK into recession, such is the pressure on household finances '
            'from higher prices, only moderate wage rises and significant tax '
            'rises due next spring. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to '
            'the EY Item Club, said while some MPC members might argue the '
            'government was pouring fuel on the inflationary fire, this view '
            'was misguided. “Tightening policy when other major central banks '
            'are still in loosening mode would seem incongruous, particularly '
            'when the UK economy was more affected by the pandemic than the US '
            'and the eurozone,” he said.',

{'article': 'I have come on an annual pilgrimage, this autumn afternoon, along '
            'a muddy track under a tunnel of trees, in search of two '
            'toadstools that fire the imagination. One is almost '
            'extraterrestrial in appearance, the other a Halloween horror '
            'story from the underworld. Until two years ago, in a lifetime of '
            'looking, I had never seen an earthstar. But then a naturalist '
            'told me about a colony of these most charismatic toadstools, rare '
            'in our region, growing on a bank beside this path. And here they '
            'are again today, collared earthstars, Geastrum triplex, half '
            'hidden among ivy, looking like invaders from another planet. Each '
            'began when barely visible underground hyphae coalesced into an '
            'egg-shaped object on the soil surface. Now the outer rind has '
            'split into segments that are folded back, like spacecraft '
            'landing-module ramps, revealing a sphere with a pore in the top, '
            'ready to puff clouds of spores whenever a raindrop splashes '
            'against its paper-thin walls.\n'
            'As the autumn days grow shorter, the fleshy rays will curl back '
            'further, eventually levering the whole toadstool from the ground. '
            'Then it will be free for the wind to carry away across the '
            'landscape, like tumbleweed, shedding more spores as it bounds. If '
            'evolution’s twin forces of chance and necessity hadn’t already '
            'crafted this unlikely fungus, then HG Wells might surely have '
            'invented it for a role in The War of the Worlds. Further down the '
            'path, another toadstool, this one worthy of a gruesome Edgar '
            'Allan Poe horror story: dead moll’s fingers, Xylaria longipes. '
            'Miniature hands of slender, spongy fingers attached to skeletal '
            'wrists, reaching up from the shallow grave of a decaying sycamore '
            'branch. This species has an explosive method for finding new '
            'hosts, shooting spores from microscopic flasks clustered in pits '
            'on its surface: fungal artillery, silent, unseen, performing its '
            'seasonal bombardment. The sun is setting, daylight has begun to '
            'fade. A chill has settled over the wood. Time for a final deep '
            'breath of glorious autumnal scent before heading home, lungs '
            'filled with the aroma of damp earth, decaying leaves and, no '
            'doubt, some spores of earthstar and dead moll’s fingers. • '

{'article': 'Joe Biden exuded confidence. “We’re going to win,” the US '
            'president told reporters before departing Cop26 in Glasgow. “I '
            'think we’re going to win in Virginia.” But as Biden returns to '
            'Washington, he faces questions about why his prediction was so '
            'wrong – and whether Democrats’ loss in the most important '
            'election of the year will send his presidency into a downward '
            'spiral.\n'
            'The Republican Glenn Youngkin’s surprise victory over the '
            'Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the race for governor of Virginia is '
            'a brutal rebuke for Biden, who had personally invested in the '
            'race, twice making the short trip from Washington to campaign for '
            'McAuliffe at rallies. It will particularly sting because Donald '
            'Trump, whom he defeated in Virginia by 10 percentage points in '
            'last year’s presidential election, will doubtless seek to claim '
            'credit for the result and savor his revenge. But the truth is '
            'that this election was more about the current president than the '
            'spectre of the last one. Biden’s ambitious agenda has stalled in '
            'Congress. By his own admission, the inertia has sucked oxygen '
            'away from priorities such as a police reform and voting rights, '
            'disillusioning the activists who fuel Democratic turnout. '
            'Inflation and gasoline prices are up. Global supply chains are '
            'buckling. And Biden’s sunny predictions for post-withdrawal '
            'Afghanistan were as off the mark as his predictions for '
            'Virginia.\n'
            'The president’s sagging approval rating of 42% combined with '
            'historical headwinds to drag McAuliffe down. Nothing energizes a '
            'political movement like opposition: the president’s party has '
            'lost every election for governor of Virginia over almost half a '
            'century – the exception was McAuliffe himself in 2013. But this '
            'time McAuliffe failed to inspire. The chairman of Hillary '
            'Clinton’s 2008 presidential primary campaign had a distinct whiff '
            'of Clinton 2016: a career politician imbued with a sense of '
            'entitlement who constantly found himself on the defensive against '
            'an upstart candidate drawing bigger crowds. Like Hillary '
            'Clinton’s reference to “deplorables”, McAuliffe made a perceived '
            'gaffe – “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what '
            'they should teach” – which was replayed endlessly in Youngkin '
            'attack ads. McAuliffe’s central argument – that Youngkin is an '
            'acolyte of Trump – was about the past. Youngkin’s central '
            'argument – that schools are under attack from culture warriors on '
            'race and gender – was about the future, even if it was riddled '
            'with falsehoods. To many voters, the future tends to be more '
            'persuasive. Enough of them did not seem to know or care that '
            'Youngkin’s arguments on schools were based on a lie. He stoked '
            'fears about critical race theory being taught in schools – it '
            'isn’t – with a caricature of Black children learning to think '
            'they are victims and white children learning to self-hate. It cut '
            'through and proved effective in a febrile, pandemic-era '
            'atmosphere where parents shout and even turn violent at school '
            'board meetings debating issues such as gender identity and mask '
            'mandates. Whereas McAuliffe wanted to nationalize the election, '
            'Youngkin managed to keep it local, albeit by tapping into Fox '
            'News talking points following last year’s Black Lives Matter '
            'protests. Expect this incendiary mix of children and racism to be '
            'chapter one of the Republican playbook in next year’s midterm '
            'elections for Congress. Expect chapter two to be How to Deal with '
            'a Problem Called Donald Trump.\n'
            'The 45th president will still be welcome in the safe districts of '
            'the Make America Great Again nation, sure to draw fanatical '
            'crowds and turn out the vote. But in swing states, Youngkin has '
            'shown Republicans the way to have their cake and eat it too. In '
            'the Republican primary, he praised Trump and fanned his false '
            'claims of voter fraud by raising concerns about “election '
            'integrity”. In the general election, he was willing to tacitly '
            'pat Trump on the back without ever embracing him – he eschewed '
            'mentions of the former president in campaign speeches and must '
            'have been tremendously relieved that Trump never turned up in '
            'person. Youngkin squared the circle that many Republicans have '
            'struggled with, creating a template for how to win over moderates '
            'and independents without alienating the Trump base, or vice '
            'versa. Call it the Goldilocks principle of strategic ambiguity: '
            'neither too hot nor too cold, but just the right temperature. '
            'Democrats knew exactly what he was doing. McAuliffe relentlessly '
            'tried to conflate Youngkin with Trump. At a rally last week, '
            'Biden warned: “Extremism can come in many forms. It can come in '
            'the rage of a mob driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a '
            'smile and a fleece vest. Either way, the big lie is still a big '
            'lie.” But it was all in vain. Youngkin, like Trump, might have '
            'emphasized his status as a businessman and political outsider but '
            'otherwise came over as a suburban dad, more polished and less '
            'profane: the acceptable face of Trumpism. Yet his tactics were '
            'just as dark, dishonest and divisive. Democrats will now need to '
            'find a counter-strategy fast. Some commentators have suggested '
            'that members of the House and Senate could desert Biden and rush '
            'to the exits, retiring rather than facing a bloodbath in the '
            'midterms, so weakening the president’s hand at a crucial moment '
            'for his agenda. Virginia is a warning cry that the party needs '
            'strong leadership to get it done before things fall apart. '
            'Wednesday marks the first anniversary of Biden’s defeat of Trump '
            'in a presidential election like no other. But the pandemic of '
            'Trumpism rages in new and unexpected ways – and the Youngkin '
            'variant may prove among the most dangerous.',

{'article': 'An Italian woman who investigated what she thought was a burglar '
            'on her balcony, has described a petrifying encounter with a rare '
            'brown bear. The Marsican bear had climbed on to her bedroom '
            'balcony in Pescosolido, a village in the Lazio province of '
            'Frosinone, just days after a bear was spotted bathing in the '
            'fountain of a neighbouring village. Annalisa Castagna and her '
            'husband, Claudio Parravano, came face-to-face with the bear on '
            'Sunday night. The Marsican is a critically endangered subspecies '
            'of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle '
            'Italy’s Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions. The couple initially '
            'thought there was a burglar on their first-floor balcony after '
            'hearing noises shortly after midnight, and stepped outside to '
            'investigate, using the light of their mobile phones. “I '
            'practically screamed in the face of the bear,” Castagna wrote in '
            'a Facebook post shared with the online community group Sei di '
            'Pescosolido se. “The bear snarled back at me and tried to reach '
            'me with its paw. In the dim light of the mobile phone, I was able '
            'to count all its teeth and see its red tongue.” Castagna leapt '
            'back inside, while Parravano threw himself over the balcony to '
            'escape the animal, causing minor injuries. The bear fled, leaving '
            'its faeces on the balcony. “The bear was certainly frightened, '
            'possibly even more than we were,” said Castagna. “The fear was '
            'great and we thank God [nothing happened]. We ask our fellow '
            'Pescosolido citizens to be careful … and we hope those in charge '
            'will ensure that the bear returns to its natural habitat without '
            'being harmed.” The encounter came a few days after a Marsican '
            'brown bear took a dip in the fountain of the main square in San '
            'Donato Val di Comino, a nearby village of about 1,200 residents '
            'where bears have occasionally been sighted on the streets. A '

            'the manager of the bar right by the square,” Tramontozzi told '
            'Kodami, a website for news about animals. “Seeing the bear so '
            'quiet and relaxed in the fountain, at about 7.45pm, when there '
            'were some people around, was very emotional.” Both villages are '
            'close to the vast national park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise, '
            'home to the endangered Marsican bears, of which only an estimated '
            '50 are left. The animals tend to venture into inhabited areas '
            'more between September and November, but are not known to be '
            'aggressive towards humans. A spokesperson for the national park, '
            'Daniela D’Amico, said: “Experts from the national park went to '
            'Pescosolido today to better understand what happened on Sunday '
            'night, but it is a little strange to hear that the bear managed '
            'to climb on to the balcony.” Marsican bears that gravitate '
            'towards towns in search of food during the autumn are either '
            'females with cubs or young bears, she said. “Bears are '
            'opportunistic and follow their stomachs … in this period they '
            'need to eat a lot in order to face the winter.” She added: “It’s '
            'not that they’re malnourished. There is abundant food in the '
            'mountains. But staying in the mountains is risky for the young, '
            'who will have to share their territory and food with adult bears, '
            'and for female bears, who are at risk of male bears killing their '
            'cubs, forcing the female back into heat.” In 2019, the Italian '
            'branch of the World Wildlife Fund warned that the Marsican brown '
            'bear faced extinction. The population has dwindled during the '
            'past 25 years, with 63% of bear deaths attributed to illegal '
            'hunting or being hit by vehicles.',

{'article': 'Joe Biden suffered a bitter political blow early on Wednesday '
            'when Democrats went down in a shock defeat in the election for '
            'governor of Virginia. The Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, '
            'had campaigned with Biden and Barack Obama but it was not enough '
            'to prevent the Republican Glenn Youngkin pulling off an upset. '
            'The AP called the race for Youngkin in the early hours of '
            'Wednesday morning. The Republican took an early lead after polls '
            'closed that he maintained throughout the evening, while McAuliffe '
            'lagged in key counties that Biden swept in 2020. Clenching his '
            'fists then clapping his hands, Youngkin addressed jubilant '
            'supporters in Chantilly just after 1am. “All righty, Virginia, we '
            'won this thing!” he exclaimed. “How much fun!” The 54-year-old '
            'political neophyte described it as “a defining moment” for '
            'millions of Virginians “sharing dreams and hopes”. Youngkin '
            'promised: “Together, we will change the trajectory of this '
            'commonwealth and friends, we are going to start that '
            'transformation on day one. There is no time to waste.” In a nod '
            'to what became his defining campaign issue, the Republican said: '
            '“We are going to restore excellence in our schools... We are '
            'going to introduce choice in our public school system... Friends, '
            'we’re going to embrace our parents, not ignore them. We’re gonna '
            'press forward with a curriculum that includes listening to '
            'parents’ input.” As on the campaign trail, Youngkin did not utter '
            'the name “Trump”. The battle in Virginia has been seen as a '
            'litmus test of Biden’s presidency one year after he won the White '
            'House, and it coincided with his agenda stalling in Congress and '
            'his approval rating sinking to 42%. “The fight continues,” said '
            'McAuliffe in a speech on Tuesday night, thanking his campaign '
            'staff for a hard-fought race, but stopping short of a concession. '
            '“We’ve got to make sure we protect women’s right to choose here '
            'in the commonwealth of Virginia. We’ve got to make sure everyone '
            'gets quality, affordable healthcare here in the commonwealth of '
            'Virginia. Everybody’s entitled to a world-class education here in '
            'the commonwealth of Virginia and we are going to continue that '
            'fight tonight, and every day going forward.” McAuliffe’s all-out '
            'effort to portray Youngkin as an acolyte of Donald Trump proved '
            'less effective than the Republican’s laser-like focus on whipping '
            'up parents’ fear and anger about culture war issues in Virginia’s '
            'schools. Youngkin made false claims that critical race theory – '
            'an analytic framework through which academics examine the ways '
            'that racial disparities are reproduced by the law – is rampant in '
            'the state’s education system (in fact it is not taught). His '
            'campaign zeroed in on a perceived gaffe by McAuliffe at one of '
            'their debates: “I don’t think parents should be telling schools '
            'what they should teach.”\n'
            'Importantly, Youngkin was also successful walking a political '
            'tightrope in which he accepted Trump’s endorsement but never '
            'mentioned him in stump speeches or invited him to campaign with '
            'him in person. He cultivated sufficient ambiguity to appeal to '
            'moderate Republicans without alienating the Trump base. History '
            'was on Youngkin’s side in that the party that loses the White '
            'House tends to be energised and usually wins the Virginia’s '
            'governor’s race a year later. But McAuliffe himself had bucked '
            'that rule when he became governor in 2014 (he was limited to one '
            'term). However, no Republican had won statewide office since '
            '2009, and Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points, '
            'meaning that a Democratic loss here would reverberate across the '
            'nation. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a similar story was unfolding '
            'as the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, fought to win '
            're-election against his Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli. '
            'That race was too close to call, with Ciattarelli narrowly ahead. '
            'If Murphy holds his office, he would be the first Democrat '
            're-elected as the state’s governor in 44 years, while a defeat '
            'would bode ill for national Democrats. At McAuliffe’s election '
            'night event at a hotel in Tysons, Virginia, giant TVs that had '
            'been showing cable news coverage were switched off long before '
            'any result was finalized. Stunned supporters trailed out into the '
            'chilly night.\n'
            'Manisha Singh, 48, an analyst, said: “It’s extremely '
            'disappointing. I can’t imagine all the lies that were spread to '
            'influence voters. I was knocking on doors and people were saying '
            'take the porn out of public schools, which is a lie. They were '
            'just repeating what they had seen on Fox News.” Singh added: '
            '“This might be a huge wake-up call to Democrats. We always play '
            'nice when the other party spreads lies. We need to be more '
            'aggressive. “ Argument quickly broke out among national Democrats '
            'over what had gone wrong. The Progressive Change Campaign '
            'Committee said in a statement: “Terry McAuliffe sadly can blame '
            'his loss on a few corporate-aligned obstructionist Democrats who '
            'blocked bold action in Congress, plus his own reliance on '
            'backward-looking Trump messaging. It added: “Democrats won’t win '
            'simply by branding one opponent after another as a Trump clone, '
            'and then hoping to squeak out a razor-thin win. When Democrats '
            'fail to run on big ideas or fulfill bold campaign promises, we '
            'depress our base while allowing Republicans to use culture wars '
            'to hide their real agenda.” McAuliffe, a career politician and '
            'establishment Democrat, is likely to point to Biden’s falling '
            'popularity and Washington gridlock as factors in his defeat. '
            'Youngkin, a former executive at the private-equity firm the '
            'Carlyle Group, sold himself as a political outsider challenging '
            'the liberal elite. His strategy – a delicate balancing act of '
            'stoking culture wars in education and winking at Trump without '
            'fully embracing him – is seen as a potential blueprint for '
            'Republican candidates in next year’s congressional elections. '
            'Trump said in a statement: “All McAuliffe did was talk Trump, '
            'Trump, Trump and he lost! What does that tell you, Fake News? I '
            'guess people running for office as Democrats won’t be doing that '
            'too much longer. I didn’t even have to go rally for Youngkin, '
            'because McAuliffe did it for me.” Dan Conston, president of the '
            'Congressional Leadership Fund, a super political action committee '
            'dedicated to electing Republicans to the House of '
            'Representatives, said: “Tonight’s results put every Democrat in '
            'Congress on notice. “Virginia was once ground zero for suburban '
            'decline but has now become the epicenter of a Republican comeback '
            'in 2022. If Republicans can win even in a state so blue that Joe '
            'Biden won by 10 points, then far more Democrats are in peril next '
            'year than they want to admit.” The battles in Virginia and New '
            'Jersey came as voters in states across the US headed to the polls '
            'on Tuesday, an off-year election day, to cast their ballots for '
            'local governors, mayors and public measures. In New York, the '
            'former police officer Eric Adams easily won his race to become '
            'the next mayor of New York City. In Boston, Michelle Wu made '
            'history when she defeated Annissa Essaibi-George to become the '
            'first woman of color and Asian American elected as the city’s '
            'mayor. History was also made in Durham, North Carolina, where '
            'Elaine O’Neal became the city’s first Black female mayor after '
            'campaigning on neighborhood safety, housing and economic relief '
            'in the aftermath of the pandemic, while Abdullah Hammoud won the '
            'mayoral race in Dearborn, Michigan, making him the city’s first '
            'Arab American leader. In Minneapolis, voters rejected an '
            'initiative that would have replaced the police department with a '
            'new department of public safety, nearly a year and a half after '
            'the police killing of George Floyd inspired nationwide protests '
            'against police brutality. Maanvi Singh and the Associated Press '

{'article': 'Facebook has announced it is deleting about 1bn “faceprints” it '
            'used as part of a facial recognition system for photo tagging, '
            'citing concerns with the technology. Meta, the company formally '
            'known as Facebook, announced on Tuesday it would end its use of '
            'facial recognition technology in the coming weeks. A third of '
            'Facebook’s users, or about 1 billion people, had opted into the '
            'service, Meta’s vice-president of artificial intelligence Jerome '
            'Pesenti said. So is the company really concerned about people’s '
            'privacy, or is it just a public relations move? How was Facebook '
            'using facial recognition technology? When people opted in to '
            'allowing the use of facial recognition, Facebook scanned a '
            '“faceprint” of that user and used it to find photos and videos of '
            'them on the platform, and suggested tagging them.\n'
            'It was also used to identify if someone else was impersonating '
            'that user on Facebook, and helped with accessibility for people '
            'with visual impairments by telling them who was in a photo. Why '
            'is Facebook stopping it? Pesenti said while facial recognition '
            'technology is a powerful tool to verify identity, it needs strong '
            'privacy and transparency controls to let people limit how their '
            'faces are used. He noted there were “many concerns” about the '
            'place of facial recognition technology in society, with '
            'regulators still playing catch up. “Amid this ongoing '
            'uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial '
            'recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate,” he '
            'said. Pesenti said facial recognition was most valuable when '
            'operating on a person’s device only – such as for unlocking '
            'iPhones – rather than communicating with an external server, as '
            'Facebook’s technology had operated. It comes at a time when '
            'Facebook has faced widespread criticism over its attitude towards '
            'user privacy and safety, after the release of tens of thousands '
            'of internal documents from Facebook whistleblower Frances '
            'Haugen.\n'
            'What will happen to tagged photos? A spokesperson for Facebook '
            'said there would be no change to existing tagged photos or videos '
            'that were tagged using the technology, just that there will not '
            'be a suggested tag in the future. What will it mean for assisting '
            'people with visual impairments? People will still be able to add '
            'text and tags to their photos and videos, but Facebook won’t '
            'automatically suggest them. What will happen to my faceprint? '
            'Facebook says it will be deleted. If you opted out of the service '
            'before this, or never opted in, or deleted your account, Facebook '
            'has said the faceprint would not be retained.\n'
            'Had there been any data breach or sale of faceprint information? '
            'Facebook has previously said that the only person who could '
            'access the faceprint was the account user, and a spokesperson '
            'confirmed there had been no other access to the faceprint '
            'information. Will it be replaced with something else? The '
            'spokesperson said Meta believes there are “a number of '
            'potentially positive use cases for facial recognition in the '
            'future” and it’s something the company will explore, but privacy, '
            'control and transparency will be front of mind. “For each '
            'potential future application, we’ll continue to be public about '
            'its intended use, how people can have control over these systems '
            'and their personal data, and how we’re ensuring the technology '
            'lives up to our responsible innovation framework,” he said. Meta '
            'is shifting its focus to creating the metaverse, and trying a '
            'whole bunch of new things at the same time as it battles against '

{'article': 'The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ordered a '
            'review of grants funding in the state but denied the move was an '
            'admission that two grants at the centre of an anti-corruption '
            'investigation were improperly awarded. On Wednesday, Perrottet '
            'announced he had ordered the department of premier and cabinet to '
            'conduct a review of grant procedures to “ensure the fairness and '
            'probity of current grant systems”. But the state opposition says '
            'it is concerned the review may not go far enough. Labor said it '
            'would adopt recommendations made by the Independent Commission '
            'Against Corruption (Icac) to improve transparency over grant '
            'funding, as well as introducing rules requiring ministers to '
            'explain when they diverged from department advice. Perrottet’s '
            'announcement followed evidence by his predecessor, Gladys '
            'Berejiklian, to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog that the '
            'government “threw money at seats to keep them” and grants were '
            'made to help win votes. This week, Icac concluded 11 days of '
            'public hearings into Berejiklian’s conduct, a probe which centred '
            'around two multi-million dollar grants in the seat held by her '
            'then-secret boyfriend, the Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. The '
            'investigation heard evidence that Maguire had consistently '
            'lobbied for the grants over several years, and that they were '
            'ultimately signed off by Berejiklian despite concerns from within '
            'the public sector. The former premier used her appearance before '
            'Icac to defend the grants, saying they had been awarded in part '
            'to shore up support for the Coalition government following the '
            'loss of the Orange by-election to the Shooters, Fishers and '
            'Farmers party. Since her resignation, Perrottet has been critical '
            'of the practice of pork barrelling in government, saying he '
            'disagreed with the “concept”. On Wednesday, he said he had asked '
            'both the department and the productivity commissioner, Peter '
            'Achterstraat, to conduct a review of grant funding.\n'
            '“Taxpayers expect the distribution of funds will be fair, I share '
            'that expectation,” Perrottet said. “Every dollar from NSW '
            'taxpayers is important. I am committed to making sure grant '
            'programs are fair, robust and follow best practice when those '
            'dollars are put to work in the community.” But during a press '
            'conference, Perrottet denied the review was an admission proper '
            'process had not been followed in relation to the two Wagga Wagga '
            'grants, saying it was “important there is public confidence in '
            'relation to the expenditure of taxpayer funds”. Perrottet also '
            'said the report, due in April, may not lead to any concrete '
            'changes in grant funding processes. “These guidelines haven’t '
            'been looked at since 2010, I think it is incredibly important we '
            'look at it. Perhaps nothing will change, it’s really a matter for '
            'the government to look at a better way of doing things,” he '
            'said.\n'
            'The opposition seized on those comments, criticising Perrottet '
            'for refusing to commit to an overhaul of grant funding. On '
            'Wednesday, NSW Labor said in government it would require '
            'ministers to explain “in writing and provide reasons” if they '
            'went against a department recommendation on grant funding. The '
            'party would also introduce recommendations made by Icac last year '
            'as part of its submission to an inquiry into the integrity of '
            'grant funding. The inquiry, prompted by the government’s $252m '
            'Stronger Communities Fund, found money was overwhelmingly spent '
            'in Coalition-held seats and led to an admission from Berejiklian '
            'that it did amount to pork barrelling but was “not an illegal '
            'practice”. In its submission to the inquiry, Icac recommended '
            'changes to the government’s 2010 “good practice guide” to include '
            'obligations for ministers to “act ethically and in accordance '
            'with general probity principals such as transparency, '
            'accountability and fairness”. “The growing culture of '
            'pork-barrelling by this Liberal National government must be '
            'broken,” Labor leader Chris Minns said. Perrottet’s announcement '
            'came at the same time it was revealed more than 90% of schools '
            'selected as part of a $20m pilot to fund solar power systems were '
            'in Coalition-held seats. The Daily Telegraph reported 92% of the '
            '25 schools selected as part of the pilot program came from '
            'Coalition seats, including two in the ultra-marginal seat of '
            'Penrith in western Sydney which is held by deputy Liberal party '
            'leader Stuart Ayres. Three of the schools were from Dubbo, which '
            'is held by the Nationals with a margin of just over 2%. Only two '
            'of the 25 schools were from non-government seats, including one '
            'held by the rival Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. Sign up to '

            'The NSW opposition leader Chris Minns accused the government of '
            'prioritising “their own interests ahead of what’s best for the '
            'people of this state”. “Many schools who are eligible and '
            'deserving of the schools renewables grant will be rightly asking '
            'why they have not been successful. Dominic Perrottet owes them an '
            'explanation,” he said. But the government has defended the '
            'grants. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the schools '
            'chosen for the pilot program were selected by the department of '
            'education based on areas where the “electricity grid is '
            'constrained” – and that the program had been targeted at regional '
            'areas. Her office released correspondence which it said showed '
            'the schools chosen for the pilot had been recommended by the '
            'department. An email chain from June shows the minister’s office '
            'had requested the department provide it with the list of schools, '
            'and that almost all of the schools selected came from its initial '
            'recommendation. Two of the recommended schools were not selected '
            'because one was in recess and the other did not require the '
            'project.\n'
            '“They are located in areas where the electricity grid is '
            'constrained and, in order to deliver commitments made through the '
            'cooler classrooms program, require an electrical upgrade which '
            'would have involved a costly upgrade to electrical '
            'infrastructure,” a spokesperson for the minister said.',

{'article': 'An injunction to stop Victoria’s largest public health service '
            'from firing nurses who are refusing the Covid-19 vaccination or '
            'refusing to disclose their vaccination status has been thrown out '
            'by the federal court ahead of a trial challenging the vaccine '
            'mandate. Nick Ferrett QC is representing about 90 nurses at '
            'Monash Health, and told the court on Wednesday that under '
            'Victoria’s Occupational Health and Safety Act, the nurses should '
            'be consulted before any disciplinary action is taken against '
            'them. “There’s no suggestion that any of the … relevant employees '
            '… is dogmatic about vaccines, and unwilling in all circumstances '
            'to get vaccinated,” Ferrett said. “So consultation has value in '
            'those circumstances.”\n'
            'A directive from Victoria’s chief health officer under the Public '
            'Health Act makes it clear that health workers must be fully '
            'vaccinated, having received at least their first Covid-19 vaccine '
            'dose by 29 October, in order to work in a healthcare setting. '
            'They must provide evidence of vaccination to their employer. But '
            'Justice John Snaden said there was “no evidence” that Monash '
            'Health was trying to prevent nurses from exercising their '
            'workplace rights by commencing disciplinary action to fire them. '
            '“On the contrary, the evidence that there is very much suggests '
            'that the course that has been plotted has been plotted because '
            'Monash Health has formed the view that under the public health '
            'directions by which it is bound, they’re not permitted to do '
            'anything else [other than terminate employment],” he said. '
            'Ferrett argued whether Monash Health had commenced the '
            'disciplinary action because workers were asserting their rights '
            'and pushing to be consulted should be explored at trial. But '
            'Snaden said the nurses “… can’t point to anything in the way of '
            'evidence that substantiates their contention”. Sign up to receive '
            'an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every '
            'morning\n'
            '“The relevant employees maintain that they ought to have been '
            'consulted about the vaccination direction and that the '
            'disciplinary action to which they are imminently to be subjected '
            'will be visited upon them because they possessed, and or, sought '
            'to exercise that right to be consulted,” he said. “It appears '
            'very unlikely, perhaps even impossible on the material that has '
            'been filed to date, that the applicants will be able to succeed '
            'in their claim that they have been or will soon be the victims of '
            'adverse action because or for reasons that include that they have '
            'possessed or exercised workplace rights, or because Monash Health '
            'wishes to prevent them from exercising any such right. “That of '
            'course presupposes that they in fact do possess such a right or '
            'rights. That will be a live question at trial.”\n'
            'Chris O’Grady QC, representing Monash Health, said the employer '
            'had simply been following the chief health officer’s directions. '
            '“In light of the CHO directions it goes without saying that '
            'anyone working in the health sector is going to have difficulty '
            'working in that sector absent their willingness to either be '
            'vaccinated or disclose their vaccination status,” he said. Monash '
            'Health also denied it was obliged to consult with employees '
            'before terminating them, and that it would, in any case, not '
            'change its requirement to abide by the CHO directions. Snaden '
            'said when the matter goes to trial, if the court finds the '
            'vaccine mandate was unlawful, then the nurses would likely have '
            'their employment reinstated and receive back pay. Therefore, the '
            'court had no reason to block disciplinary action including Monash '
            'Health firing the nurses in the meantime, he said, adding that '
            'the case had been “at best, weak”. Monash Health had given '
            'undertakings not to take action against the relevant nurses until '
            'the matter was determined. In light of Snaden’s decision on '
            'Wednesday, Monash Health was now free to terminate the staff. The '
            'substantive proceeding will now be allocated to a judge, to be '
            'heard at a later date.',

            'October: No restrictions on travel around the state. No masks '
            'outside. People can return to work if fully vaccinated. Outdoor '
            'public gatherings of 30 people allowed. Gyms and retail reopen, '

{'article': 'Creating an international price for carbon emissions could reduce '
            'global greenhouse gases by 12% at a cost of less than 1% of '
            'global GDP, according to a new report from the World Economic '
            'Forum (WEF) and PwC. The report found that if global governments '
            'agreed together to set a price for pollution to help cut carbon '
            'emissions the cost would be less than the economic losses '
            'triggered by the fallout of a runaway climate crisis. The “carbon '
            'revenues” raked in to government coffers from the world’s '
            'most-polluting companies could also be used to help hard-pressed '
            'households or ploughed back into green industries which help '
            'reduce emissions while creating jobs and economic growth, the '
            'report found. Bob Moritz, the global chair of auditing giant PwC, '
            'said setting a global carbon price could make a “significant '
            'contribution to tackling global warming by accelerating emissions '
            'reductions”. The report analysed a scheme proposed by the '
            'International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this year to help '
            'accelerate the world’s carbon emissions cuts by 2030 in a bid to '
            'stay within 1.5C to 2C of global heating compared with '
            'pre-industrialised levels, as set out under the Paris agreement '
            'in 2015. “We found this could be done without severe economic '
            'damage to livelihoods and business, although the effects would be '
            'somewhat uneven across the world. The costs to society and '
            'business of failing to act are far greater,” Mortiz added. Under '
            'the IMF scheme companies with high greenhouse gas emissions, in '
            'high-income countries, would be subject to a carbon price of $75 '
            'for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. This would fall to $50 '
            'a tonne for polluters in middle-income countries, and $25 a tonne '
            'for low-income countries. Currently, the price of carbon is set '
            'at anywhere from $0 to more than $130 per tonne of CO2 equivalent '
            'across different global regions. In some cases this has created '
            'an uneven playing field by making it cheaper for international '
            'companies to move high-carbon activities, such as manufacturing, '
            'to countries without carbon schemes to avoid paying a price for '
            'pollution. But WEF and PwC found widespread participation in '
            'carbon price set across the global economy, even at reduced price '
            'floors for low and middle-income countries, would lead to very '
            'little “carbon leakage” from companies moving their manufacturing '
            'to countries where carbon prices are lower. Børge Brende, the '
            'president of WEF, said although the findings of the report are '
            '“extremely positive”, a huge amount of cooperation between '
            'governments and private sector companies would be key for carbon '
            'pricing to move ahead and accelerate efforts for a more '
            'sustainable and inclusive recovery. The political and technical '
            'challenges behind creating a global carbon price have stalled '
            'plans, leaving a patchwork of different international schemes to '
            'reduce carbon emissions which include mandatory emissions trading '
            'and carbon taxes, and voluntary carbon offset schemes. In the UK, '
            'a carbon price floor was introduced in 2013 at a rate of only £16 '
            'per tonne, and rose to £18.08 (€20.40), which has managed to '
            'drive almost all of the UK’s coal plants out of the electricity '
            'market in recent years. Coal power made up about 2% of '
            'electricity last year compared with around half of all power '
            'generation a decade ago.',

            'water after the fact … and we’re not keeping pace with these '
            'chemicals.” The list includes some substances that have been in '
            'production and used for years, but are only now being monitored '
            'by regulators as their links to health problems become clear. '
            'Other contaminants include those that industry is only beginning '
            'to use in larger quantities. Many of the substances were '
            'identified as part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s '
            'unregulated contaminant monitoring rule (UMCR), which is one of '
            'the first steps in the regulation process. It tracks chemicals’ '
            'presence in some water systems and its aim is to provide the EPA '
            'with a picture of how widespread a chemical’s contamination is '
            'before new limits are established. Among other substances '
            'detected is HAA-9, a byproduct of the drinking water disinfection '
            'process. Regulators previously set limits for HAA-5, a '
            'contaminant in the same family that was found to cause health '
            'problems. Industry claimed HAA-9 was safe, but recent studies '
            'linked it to low birthrate, so the EPA is beginning to track it. '
            'However, setting limits can be a lengthy process, and the EPA has '
            'failed to set a new limit under the UMCR in the 20 years since '
            'the rule was implemented. The agency found what Stoiber '
            'characterized as “eye-opening” levels of PFAS compounds in 2013 '
            'yet is aiming to set water limits for just two kinds by next '
            'year. Other contaminants in the new list were detected by states '
            'that are moving to put stricter regulations in place for '
            'chemicals, like PFAS. In the meantime, there’s little that people '
            'can do beyond educating themselves about which contaminants are '
            'in their water system, buying filters and advocating for stronger '
            'regulations. EWG’s database allows users to search for '
            'contaminants in water systems by zip code, and it provides a '
            'guide on which chemicals water filters can remove. “Everyone can '
            'be educated,” Stoiber said. “Contact the local utility, ask them '
            'questions about what they’re doing … and push for stronger '
            'regulations that protect people’s health.”',

{'article': 'Rains and storms are expected to lash central and eastern '
            'Australia in the coming days, bringing another sodden end to the '
            'week as tropical moisture flows down from the north. South '
            'Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, western Victoria, '
            'western New South Wales and western Queensland will see falls of '
            'up to 100mm in hard-hit areas as Australia edges closer to '
            'declaring an official La Niña.\n'
            'Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Jonathan Howe said '
            'it would be “one of the wettest weeks” coming into summer for '
            'every mainland state and territory as a trough extended from the '
            'Great Australian Bight to the tropics. “Across central and '
            'eastern Australia it will be muggy, rainy and stormy,” he said. '
            '“Every state and territory will be hit by thunderstorms and rain '
            'over the next week, with showers coming past before the storms '
            'arrive.”\n'
            'Howe said Western Australia, western Queensland and New South '
            'Wales, northern Victoria and much of the Northern Territory would '
            'be hit the hardest on Thursday and Friday, before storms '
            'gradually shifted to the east coming into the weekend. The '
            'heaviest rain – between 50mm and 100mm –is expected across remote '
            'Western Australia, the Kimberley and the Top End, while parts of '
            'north-east Victoria and south-east New South Wales were predicted '
            'to see rain of up to 50mm. “It depends on where the thunderstorms '
            'fall, but there are heavy rain warnings in place in northern '
            'Victoria and western New South Wales and there’s already the risk '
            'of flash flooding in remote areas,” Howe said. “Some places are '
            'soaked already, so there is a risk of some marine flooding.” Howe '
            'said an active tropical moisture front was causing the storms, '
            'with steamy waters in the north of Australia sitting at '
            'temperatures between one and three degrees hotter than normal. '
            '“It’s generally in the high 20s but water is getting to 33 '
            'degrees, like a warm bath,” he said. “That’s causing evaporation, '
            'and the tropical moisture is dragged across continent, leading to '
            'humid days and instability.”\n'
            'While La Niña hadn’t been officially declared, Howe said '
            'forecasters were “on the cusp” of doing so in the coming days or '
            'weeks, and predicted the continuation of above-average rainfall '
            'lasting into summer. “You need an above-average temperature over '
            'a consecutive period, and we’re almost meeting all criteria. It’s '
            'the warm waters that would lead us to declare it,” he said. '
            '“Usually you see weather like this at the start of the active '
            'rain and cyclone period, but what is unusual is the timing. You '
            'see this in summer, at peak warmth, but it’s quite early in the '
            'season which was unexpected.” Howe said one silver lining may be '
            'the lowered risk of severe bushfires like those seen during Black '
            'Summer in 2019. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories '
            'from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            '“It was getting really hot [in 2019] but because we’re seeing so '
            'much rain across western and central Australia, it’s not giving '
            'the heat a good chance to build and we’re unlikely to see big '
            'heatwaves over the next few weeks,” he said. “It’s looking to be '
            'an average season coming into summer, but that doesn’t mean we '
            'won’t get any bushfires as all you need is a few hot days. '
            '“There’s an above normal chance of bushfires in south-east '
            'Queensland and northern New South Wales because of how dry it’s '
            'been, but across eastern Victoria and New South Wales it’s below '
            'normal, which comes back to the wet weather.”',

{'article': 'Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith says he will not resign from '
            'politics but is taking some time to “reflect on his career” after '
            'crashing his car into a family home, narrowly avoiding a child’s '

            'friend’s house before deciding to drive home on Saturday night '
            'but he returned a blood-alcohol reading of more than twice the '
            'legal limit after crashing into a Hawthorn house in Melbourne’s '
            'east. Speaking to reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday, Smith said '
            'it was the “worst decision of his life” and he had spoken to his '
            'doctor. “I’m not (mentally) unwell. I’m an idiot,” he said.\n'
            '“I’m incredible regretful of what’s occurred.” The MP for Kew '
            'returned a breath test reading of 0.131, prompting the immediate '
            'suspension of his licence for 12 months. Once touted as a future '
            'premier, Smith resigned as shadow attorney general after the '
            'crash. Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has asked the '
            '38-year-old to resign before the next election. Smith is also '
            'expected to be fined by police. Smith dodged questions that he '
            'has been asked to directly not to re-contest the next election, '
            'saying Guy only asked him to “reflect on my career”. “Matthew has '
            'made it very clear, as he has done on several occasions, that I '
            'should reflect on my career,” he said. “I’m not going to go into '
            'private conversations with a very good friend of mine.” Smith '
            'said he was not aware of how intoxicated he was because he had '
            'not eaten much that day. “As a consequence, I blew much more than '
            'I ever thought I had consumed. I’m not offering any excuses,” he '
            'said. He claimed he had only drunk “a few glasses” of wine at the '
            'dinner with friends. “It’s selfish, it’s stupid, I’ve been fined, '
            'I’ve lost my licence for a year. I profoundly messed up in a '
            'life-altering way. I can’t take that back and I’m not trying to. '
            '“It was an appalling lapse of judgment.”\n'
            'Smith said he has spoken to his GP about his alcohol consumption '
            'and has vowed not to drink again while he remains in public life. '
            '“I’m never touching a drop again,” he said.\n'
            'When asked if he had a drinking problem, Smith said he had drunk '
            'too much over the course of the pandemic. “I think like a lot of '
            'blokes my age – and please don’t construe this as an excuse – who '
            'live on their own over the last 18 months have drunk too much,” '
            'he said.\n'
            'On Tuesday, Guy said he had told Smith he would not be '
            're-appointed to the frontbench and urged him not to contest the '
            '2022 state election. “I made it very clear to Tim that he '
            'wouldn’t find his way on to the frontbench of any parliamentary '
            'Liberal party that I lead,” Guy told reporters. “And I made it '
            'clear that I didn’t want him to nominate at the next election and '
            'that I didn’t believe he should nominate for the seat of Kew. '
            '“Tim has, and will, reflect on my advice to him. He will then '
            'make a statement in his own time. I hope sooner rather than '
            'later.” Smith has been one of Guy’s closest political allies and '

{'article': 'Seven New Zealand gang leaders, representing four of the '
            'countries most well-known street gangs, have joined forces in a '
            'video urging their communities to get vaccinated, in a concept '
            'that was conjured up by a government minister. The video was '
            'commissioned by the minister for Maori development, Willie '
            'Jackson, after a discussion with gang leaders, who then provided '
            'footage that was edited by Jackson’s son, Hikurangi, the Herald '
            'reported. In the four-minute video, Denis O’Reilly, who joined '
            'the Black Power gang aged 19, says he had “taken a few shots” in '
            'his time, including the two shots against Covid-19, and he is '
            'asking his community “to do the same”. “This is not all about '
            'gangs, this is all about our whānau (family),” says Harry Tam of '
            'the Mongrel Mob. “One thing we need to be clear about is that '
            'this is not about the government telling us, it is about the '
            'experts telling the government, that is getting us to vaccinate '
            'to protect ourselves.” Fellow member Dennis Makalio says it was a '
            '“no-brainer” for him.\n'
            'New Zealand’s outbreak now stands at a total of 3,634 cases and '
            'has established itself along stark ethnic lines: about 70% of '
            'infections in the current outbreak are Māori and Pacific New '
            'Zealanders, who make up about 27% of the total population '
            'combined. About 72% of eligible Māori have had one dose of the '
            'Pfizer vaccine, compared with 85% of Pasifika and 88% of all '
            'people aged 12 and over. The virus has been detected in at least '
            'three gangs, prompting health officials to some grant some '
            'leaders essential worker status, in order to engage hard to reach '
            'communities. Tam is among those given that status, saying “we are '
            'all vulnerable” but children and elders are most at risk.\n'
            'Stephen Daley of the Head Hunters, says he was vaccinated because '
            'he cares about his children and wishes to protect his whakapapa '
            '(genealogy). While he does not want to push the vaccine on '
            'people, he does want everyone to make “an informed decision”. '
            'Paula Ormsby of Mongrel Mob Waikato Kingdom urged people to seek '
            'out Indigenous doctors who are experts on Covid-19, if they are '

{'article': 'Former police officer Eric Adams will be the next mayor of New '
            'York City, after the Democrat defeated Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday’s '
            'election. Adams was on course to easily beat Sliwa, the founder '
            'of the Guardian Angels, with a lead of 66% to 29% after more than '
            'half of projected votes were counted. Adams will now take charge '
            'of the largest city in the US in January, when he will be faced '
            'with overseeing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has '
            'killed more than 34,500 New Yorkers. Adams, 61, becomes only the '
            'second Black person to be elected New York mayor, after David '
            'Dinkins, who led the city from 1990 to 1993. Adams, who defeated '
            'several progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, has '
            'pledged to cut government inefficiency and made public safety a '
            'central part of his campaign. In a speech, Adams urged unity and '
            'told his story as a working-class child who grew up to become '
            'mayor. “Tonight, New Yorkers have chosen one of their own,” '
            'Adams, said in a victory speech. “I am you.” Adams urged unity. '
            '“Today, we take off the intramural jersey and we put on one '
            'jersey, Team New York,” he told supporters at a celebration at '
            'the New York Marriott. “Tonight is not just a victory over '
            'adversity, it is a vindication of faith. It is the proof that the '
            'forgotten can be the future.” The centrist politician has been a '
            'disappointing choice for many progressives who hoped to see '
            'radical reforms in the criminal justice system. Adams has '
            'promised to strike a balance between fighting crime and ending '
            'racial injustice in law enforcement. After winning a contentious '
            'primary, Adams was always the favorite to defeat Sliwa, a '
            'Republican, in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans seven '
            'to one. He will replace Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat who is '
            'limited to two terms as mayor, in January. Adams was born in '
            'Brownsville, Brooklyn, in 1960, and spoke during the campaign '
            'about his impoverished upbringing. He decided to join the New '
            'York City police department in an effort to change the force from '
            'within, Adams said, after being beaten by officers when he was 15 '
            'years old. He joined the police in 1984 and became a captain '
            'before leaving in 2006 to run – successfully – for state senate. '
            'During his time in the state legislature he was criticized by the '
            'New York inspector general for his role in attempting to bring a '
            'casino to a racetrack in Queens, New York City. Adams had '
            'accepted campaign contributions from a politically connected '
            'group bidding for the gambling franchise. In 2013 Adams was '
            'elected to Brooklyn borough president, a power-light position '
            'that chiefly involves championing the borough, but one which also '
            'boosted Adams’s profile as he weighed a run for mayor. Adams '
            'trailed Andrew Yang, a 2020 presidential candidate, in the early '
            'months of the Democratic primary, but came through New York’s '
            'ranked choice voting to edge out Kathryn Garcia, a former New '
            'York City sanitation commissioner, in July. His campaign raised '
            'eyebrows over the summer when Adams was forced to answer '
            'questions about whether he actually lives in the city he was '
            'bidding to lead, given he owns a home in New Jersey and was '
            'rarely spotted at the address in Brooklyn where he claims to '
            'reside. Adams has insisted he lives in New York City. Sliwa, a '
            'talk radio host best known for founding the Guardian Angels, a '
            'volunteer crime prevention group, in the 1970s, proved a '
            'charismatic if ultimately flawed candidate. He had been a regular '
            'presence on New York City’s streets, frequently standing on top '
            'of a car-pulled float and spreading his message through a '
            'microphone and speaker. Sliwa wore his red beret throughout the '
            'campaign, including during the mayoral debates, but struggled to '
            'gain much attention in a race where Adams had long been the '
            'presumptive winner.',

{'article': 'Voters in Minneapolis have rejected the idea of replacing their '
            'police department with a new department of public safety, more '
            'than a year after the murder of George Floyd by a white police '
            'officer launched a national movement to defund or abolish police. '
            'Floyd’s murder in the summer of 2020 sparked outrage and '
            'international protests on police brutality and racial injustice. '
            'In Minneapolis and elsewhere, calls for major changes to law '
            'enforcement, including defunding police departments, soon '
            'followed. If the “yes” vote had won, the Minneapolis police '
            'department would have been replaced with a department run by a '
            'nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council. '
            'The projected department would have used a “comprehensive public '
            'health approach” outlined by the mayor and city council via '
            'ordinances. Mandatory minimum police staffing would also be '
            'erased from the city charter.\n'
            'Supporters argued it was a chance to reimagine what public safety '
            'could be and how money was spent. Among other changes, supporters '
            'said, funding would have gone toward programs that did not send '
            'armed officers to call on people in crisis. The idea won wide '
            'support among many progressive groups who pointed out that it '
            'would have changed the nature of policing in the city – not '
            'gotten rid of law enforcement. “It’s a vote for us to all '
            'reimagine public safety and to move away from the type of systems '
            'that have not produced safety for all communities,” said Rashad '
            'Robinson, a spokesperson for Color of Change Pac, which organized '
            'support for the referendum. Opponents said the proposal contained '
            'no concrete plan for how to move forward and warned it would '
            'leave some communities already affected by violence more '
            'vulnerable as crime was on the rise. “Tonight Minneapolis voters '
            'have made clear that we want a planful approach to transforming '
            'policing and public safety in our city that needs to include '
            'meaningful consultation with the communities that are most '
            'impacted by both violent crime and by over-policing,” said Leili '
            'Fatehi, manager of the All of Mpls campaign, which advocated for '
            'a “no” vote on the measure. The policing amendment earned the '
            'support of several prominent progressive Democrats, including the '
            'US congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents the Minneapolis area, '
            'and the state attorney general, Keith Ellison. But other '
            'prominent figures, including the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, '
            'and the US senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, opposed it and '
            'feared the backlash could lead to Democratic losses across the '
            'country in 2022. Rishi Khanna, 31, a tech worker, voted “yes” on '
            'replacing the police department, saying he didn’t believe police '
            'officers were qualified to deal with many situations, such as '
            'mental health crises. He said he thought having professionals '
            'equipped to deal with a range of public safety issues in the same '
            'department as law enforcement would benefit both residents and '
            'police officers. “I understand that law enforcement will have to '
            'have a seat at the table, but I think both in our community and '
            'in communities around the country, too often law enforcement is '
            'the only seat at the table,” he said. “I don’t think that’s the '
            'right solution.” Askari Lyons, 61, voted against the ballot '
            'initiative. A resident of the city’s largely Black north side, he '
            'said he believed Minneapolis police officers “may have learned a '
            'lesson after George Floyd’s death and what happened to the cop '
            'that killed him”. Lyons called it “unwise” to replace the '
            'department and said he believed change within the department was '
            'imminent. “People are so frustrated, so angry, so disappointed” '
            'with the violence occurring citywide as much as they are with the '
            'city’s law enforcement, he said. Minister JaNaé Bates, a '
            'spokeswoman for the pro-amendment campaign, told reporters Monday '
            'that even if the proposal failed, the activists behind it had '
            'changed the conversation about public safety. “No matter what '
            'happens, the city of Minneapolis is going to have to move forward '
            'and really wrestle with what we cannot un-know: that the '
            'Minneapolis police department has been able to operate with '
            'impunity and has done quite a bit of harm and the city has to '
            'take some serious steps to rectify that,” Bates said. The '
            'Associated Press contributed to this report',

{'article': 'A British backpacker who worked as a waiter in Sydney has won a '
            'long-running legal dispute against Australia’s “backpacker tax” '
            'in its highest court. On Wednesday the high court ruled in favour '
            'of Catherine Addy, finding the tax which slugged working '
            'holiday-makers thousands of dollars more than Australians '
            'discriminated against her on the basis of her nationality and '
            'infringed a treaty Australia signed with the UK. The decision '
            'likely means the Australian Taxation Office will have to pay back '
            'taxes collected from up to 75,000 backpackers who worked in '
            'Australia, which has similar treaties with Chile, Finland, Japan, '
            'Norway, Turkey, Germany and Israel.\n'
            'In December 2016 Australia legislated the backpacker tax charging '
            'working holiday-makers 15% on the first $37,000 they earn a year, '
            'a maximum liability of $5,550. Australians are entitled to a '
            'tax-free threshold for the first $18,200 they earn and are only '
            'liable to pay up to $3,572 if they earn $37,000. Addy spent '
            'nearly two years in Australia between August 2015 and May 2017, '
            'earning $26,576 as a food and beverage waiter in Sydney in the '
            '2017 tax year. In October 2019 Addy won a challenge in the '
            'federal court arguing the tax discriminated against her on the '
            'basis of nationality and breached the Australia-UK treaty on '
            'avoidance of double taxation. In August 2020 the full federal '
            'court overturned the decision. Addy appealed to the high court, '
            'arguing that if the backpacker tax had applied for the full year '
            'she earned $26,576, she would have been slugged $3,986 compared '
            'with an Australian who would pay just $1,591. On Wednesday five '
            'justices of the high court unanimously allowed Addy’s appeal, '
            'finding that “more burdensome taxation” had been imposed on her '
            'due to her nationality. “When the position of Ms Addy is compared '
            'with that of an Australian national, as it must be, that is the '
            'only conclusion which may be drawn,” they said. “She did the same '
            'kind of work and earned the same amount of income from the same '
            'source; yet an Australian national was required … to pay less '
            'tax.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '
            'Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'The ATO said the decision was “only relevant” to holiday-makers '
            'who were “both an Australian resident for tax purposes” and from '
            'one of the eight countries with similar tax treaties. “Most '
            'working holiday makers will be non-residents as they are in '
            'Australia to have a holiday and working to support that holiday,” '
            'it said in a statement. “This decision will not change the tax '
            'rates for the majority of working holiday makers.” The ATO '
            'advised employers to continue using existing withholding rates '
            'until they are updated and working holiday-makers to wait for '
            'guidance “prior to lodging or amending a return or lodging an '
            'objection”. Joanna Murphy, the chief executive of Taxback.com, an '
            'international tax accounting and advisory firm that helped Addy '
            'bring the case, welcomed the high court decision.\n'
            '“The court has reaffirmed important protections for foreign '
            'citizens choosing to work while holidaying in Australia,” Murphy '
            'said in a statement. “It was always clear to us when this tax was '
            'introduced in 2016, against the wishes of the agricultural '
            'sector, that it breached a number of international tax '
            'agreements. “It also damaged Australia’s reputation as a working '
            'holiday destination.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said “the '
            'government is aware of the high court decision and the ATO is '
            'currently considering the implications of this decision and will '
            'provide guidance to taxpayers as soon as possible”. In a '
            'statement, Labor shadow ministers labelled the backpacker tax '
            '“ill-conceived and rushed”, arguing it had contributed to “huge '
            'workforce shortage challenges which the Morrison-Joyce government '
            'is still yet to fix”.',

{'article': 'When the DVD came back shattered, it felt like a sign. The '
            'creators of Hong Kong protest documentary, Inside the Red Brick '
            'Wall, had sent it to regulators for a screening approval, as '
            'they’d done numerous times before without issue. But this time '
            'the returning envelope was filled with silver shards. “We didn’t '
            'understand why, but it was intentional,” one of the anonymous '
            'creators says. “They said it was broken by the DVD machine but it '
            'was intentional – it came back in pieces. It felt intentional, '
            'like they were sending a message.” The screening was approved, '
            'but with a higher rating restricting audiences to people aged 18 '
            'and over. But the moment marked a significant shift.\n'
            'A few months later, in March, the theatre hosting the first '
            'commercial screening of the protest film cancelled on the day. '
            'Then the government-backed funding body, the Arts Development '
            'Council of Hong Kong, reportedly withdrew a major grant from the '
            'independent film collective that had released it. The incidents '
            'underline the growing intolerance from authorities to anything '
            'related to the pro-democracy movement, which wracked the city for '
            'much of 2019. In June 2020, Beijing imposed its national security '
            'law which vaguely criminalised acts as foreign collusion, '
            'sedition, secession or terrorism. Since then police have used it '
            'to arrest hundreds of journalists, politicians, campaigners and '
            'activists, and make risky the selling of particular books, '
            'artworks, and films. ‘Clear political censorship’ On Wednesday '
            'last week, Hong Kong’s parliament criminalised politically '
            'sensitive film-making, with a law allowing broad censorship under '
            'the guise of national security. The new law bans any films the '
            'government deems could “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and '
            'incite activities that might endanger national security”, and '
            'allows officials to stop productions and screenings. Any '
            'unauthorised screening of a banned film can incur three years in '
            'jail for those responsible, or a $1m fine. “The goal is very '
            'clear: it’s to improve the film censorship system, to prevent any '
            'act endangering the national security,” commerce secretary Edward '
            'Yau told the Legislative Council. Kenny Ng, associate professor '
            'at the Academy of Film at Hong Kong Baptist University told '
            'Reuters the bill was “heavy-handed”. “Adding national security '
            'clauses to the bill is clear political censorship,” he said. '
            'Obvious targets of the law are the rush of protest documentaries '
            'released in the past 12 months. The documentaries show some of '
            'the protest movement’s most violent moments and follow '
            'individuals including some who were later arrested. Many were '
            'made by anonymous teams of likeminded people who met while '
            'filming on the frontlines of protests, and were inspired to tell '
            'a deeper story than international media.\n'
            '“I think that was the moment I personally felt like this is the '
            'time we should start doing what a documentary film-maker should '
            'do,” says Iris Kwong, one of seven directors behind When A City '
            'Rises, which screened at the Brisbane International Film Festival '
            'over the weekend. “[Before then] I wasn’t going to make any films '
            'about the movement because it was something I felt like the whole '
            'world was already coming in to, so maybe I didn’t need to do it. '
            'It was a moment where I just wanted to be together with the rest '
            'of the city in this social movement.” Several film-makers tell '
            'the Guardian the new law doesn’t affect them much more than the '
            'national security law already did. Some have already gone to '
            'ground, working anonymously, while others have fled Hong Kong. '
            '‘Risks to everybody involved’ The biggest impact of the new '
            'censorship law, several say, will be on Hong Kong’s status as an '
            'international film hub and the city’s rich catalogue of lauded, '
            'thoughtful and often political films. Last week’s law allows Hong '
            'Kong’s security chief, John Lee Ka-chiu, to ban the screening of '
            'existing films if he determines they threaten national security. '
            'The one most often cited as a likely target is the 2015 film 10 '
            'Years, a dystopian and rather prophetic imagining of Hong Kong’s '
            'future, but there are many others. “We have so many films '
            'critical of governments, especially from before 1997 when we were '
            'still a colony of Britain,” says the Inside the Red Brick Wall '
            'film-maker. “It was OK to criticise the Chinese government at '
            'that time and many of our famous and iconic films are from before '
            'or around that time. So it would be a huge thing if they decided '
            'to ban those films too, because they’re very culturally '
            'significant.” Many local productions were already partnering '
            'commercially with mainland Chinese companies, and there had been '
            'a trend towards complying with mainland sensitivities, some of '
            'the film-makers note. But what was once an issue of resources is '
            'now a matter of law.\n'
            '“With Hong Kong being a hub for film-making, and most of which '
            'are really expensive to make, if your movie gets pulled that’s '
            'really bad,” says Kwong. “So I think what will happen is the '
            'impact of this law will mean more self-censorship for '
            'non-political films.” The Inside the Red Brick Wall film-maker '
            'says even in hindsight she and her team still would have made '
            'their film. When A City Rises won’t screen in Hong Kong because '
            '“there are risks to everybody involved”, says Kwong, but it will '
            'be shown in Australia and several European countries over coming '
            'months. Kwong hopes the film will help global audiences '
            'understand what happened in Hong Kong. “I think with any social '
            'movements around the world, there often isn’t a tonne that people '
            'can do, but what is worse is when people don’t know that it’s '
            'happening.”',

{'article': 'Unai Emery is close to returning to the Premier League as '
            'Newcastle’s new manager after the club’s Saudi Arabian-led owners '
            'identified the Villarreal coach as their preferred choice to '

            'proposed salary are ongoing, there is cautious optimism at St '
            'James’ Park that the former Sevilla, Arsenal and Paris '
            'Saint-Germain coach will be in place for the trip to Brighton on '
            'Saturday.\n'
            'Emery, who turns 50 on Wednesday, is due to take charge of '
            'Villlarreal at home against Young Boys in the Champions League on '
            'Tuesday night. With Newcastle happy to pay his employers about '
            '£6m in compensation, he and his advisers have been talking to '
            'Amanda Staveley and her fellow directors via Zoom since the '
            'weekend. Staveley, who runs the club on a day-to-day basis, '
            'interviewed a number of candidates but, along with her Saudi '
            'overlords and fellow director Jamie Reuben, has been left most '
            'impressed by Emery and his track record. Should he sign, his '
            'arrival on an anticipated three-year contract with a salary in '
            'the region of the £7m a year he commanded at Arsenal will be '
            'regarded as a coup for Staveley. The Spaniard not only lifted the '
            'Europa League with Villarreal last season after beating '
            'Manchester United on penalties in the final but won the '
            'competition three years in a row with Sevilla from 2014 to 2016. '
            'He subsequently won the French league with PSG before struggling '
            'as Arsène Wenger’s successor during a short spell at Arsenal when '
            'the team finished fifth in the Premier League and lost the Europa '
            'League final against Chelsea in 2019.\n'
            'At Newcastle, the man who led a Villarreal side, now sitting a '
            'modest 13th in La Liga, to their first major trophy would face a '
            'very different challenge. Newcastle are still to win a match and '
            'sit 19th after 10 Premier League games. Following Villarreal’s '
            '2-0 win against Young Boys, Emery said: “The only thing that is '
            'true is that I have been told of their [Newcastle’s] interest and '
            'I pretty much don’t have more news than that. There is no offer, '
            'which in any case would have to come via the club. So there’s no '
            'more beyond that [which would make] me say I’m going.” He added: '
            '“I do not open or close the door. I am waiting and I would talk '
            'to Fernando [Roig, the Villarreal president] and the club, for '
            'whom I have respect. My dedication is where I am.” When asked on '
            'Tuesday about a Newcastle approach for Emery, Roig said: “I have '
            'absolutely no idea. What I do know is that he has a contract with '
            'us and contracts are there to be fulfilled. I expect Unai’s '
            'professionalism and I have no doubt about that.” Roig, pressed on '
            'his calm response, said: “The important thing is that fans can’t '
            'be bought. They don’t go to Newcastle or Man United. Loads and '
            'loads of players and coaches have been and gone … you’re always '

            'window Bruce’s successor faces a tricky, fairly high-risk '
            'challenge. Should the Emery deal founder, the indications are the '
            'club would turn to Eddie Howe after the former Bournemouth '
            'manager impressed in interviews. Although the Saudis have plenty '
            'of money to spend – including scope to invest almost £200m on '
            'players in January – the short-term priority is to avoid '
            'relegation. After the 3-0 home defeat by Chelsea last Saturday '
            'the Newcastle caretaker Graeme Jones, who is set to remain on the '
            'staff, conceded the team were in a relegation fight. Emery will '
            'appreciate that joining Newcastle will involve not only turning '
            'his back on European football but working with a limited squad '
            'alarmingly over-reliant on Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin '
            'for goals and inspiration. It is the sort of role as capable of '
            'breaking a manager’s reputation as making it but Emery, seemingly '
            'still stung by his sacking from Arsenal in November 2019, is said '
            'to believe he has unfinished business in England’s top tier. He '
            'will, though, be keen to know the identity of the director of '
            'football Staveley is also seeking and plans for building the '
            'training ground that is urgently required. Newcastle’s owners '
            'must trust that Emery’s profile and contacts will help them '
            'recruit the type of player capable of leading the team out of the '

            'accelerate its drivers’ take-up of zero-emissions vehicles to '
            'meet its environmental targets. Uber pledged last year that 50% '
            'of miles driven in seven European capitals by the end of 2025 '
            'will be in battery electric cars. The vehicles produce zero '
            'exhaust emissions, helping to address the impacts on health and '
            'the climate caused by urban transport. There were stark '
            'divergences among different European capitals. The usage of '
            'electric cars ranged from 9% of miles driven in Lisbon, to 6% in '
            'London and Amsterdam, and only 0.01% in Brussels, according to '
            'internal Uber data shared with Transport & Environment (T&E), a '
            'thinktank. The other laggards were Madrid, at only 0.15% of '
            'miles, Berlin at 0.55% and Paris at 1%. However, Uber’s data '
            'showed rapid increases in electric miles in some cities. In '
            'London only 1.6% of miles driven were electric in the first half '
            'of 2020, meaning the share more than tripled in the year since. '
            'In Berlin the share of electric miles fell during the same '
            'period. Uber faces a difficult task in electrifying quickly '
            'because the cars are bought by drivers. On Wednesday it announced '
            'that London Uber drivers could put money raised via the app’s '
            'clean air fee towards buying Tesla electric cars, adding to '
            'similar programmes giving discounts on Nissan, Kia and Hyundai '
            'electric cars.\n'
            'T&E said the divergent paths taken by different cities '
            'highlighted the need for local and national regulations to '
            'promote electric cars. Saul Lopez, electric fleets programme '
            'manager at T&E, said: “Uber should be doing more but so should '
            'governments. In Amsterdam and London it’s cleaning up its fleet '
            'faster because the authorities have set up electrification '
            'mandates and effective ultra-low emissions zones.” Uber, '
            'headquartered in San Francisco, introduced its 2025 target '
            'following criticism of its environmental credentials, along with '
            'rivals such as Bolt and Lyft. Uber is aiming for 100% electric '
            'cars worldwide by 2040. A taxi ride generally uses more energy '
            'than the same trip via public transport, although Uber and other '
            'ride-hailing companies argue they will contribute to lowering '
            'emissions through a more efficient transport system. Anabel Diaz, '
            'a regional general manager for Uber, backed the call for '
            'government action to promote the use of electric vehicles. She '
            'added: “These first steps towards our ambitious electrification '
            'commitments were always going to be the most challenging given '
            'the pandemic, but drivers in Europe are switching to EVs well '

{'article': 'The Ministry of Defence’s system of procurement is “broken” and '
            'is repeatedly wasting billions in taxpayers’ money, according to '
            'a scathing assessment by a watchdog committee of MPs. The Public '
            'Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the oversight in the '
            'department was so poor that it was unable to spell out what '
            'additional capability the country will get from an extra £16.5bn '
            'which was allocated by Boris Johnson last year. Of the current 20 '
            'largest projects, 13 were running behind, by a cumulative total '
            'of 21 years – including the £4bn-plus Ajax armoured vehicle, '
            'delayed due to excessive noise and vibration. There is “no '
            'timescale” when it will be ready for service. No firm figure was '
            'put on the amount of money lost, but the MPs said there had been '
            '“wastage of taxpayers’ money running into the billions” and that '
            'the MoD at times “lacks the skilled personnel” to manage its '
            'suppliers. “The department’s system for delivering major '
            'equipment capabilities is broken,” the committee added. Dame Meg '
            'Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “This committee '
            'is determined that this state of affairs cannot, and will not, '
            'continue” – and demanded that the Treasury conduct an emergency '
            'review of MoD project management. The senior MP said that PAC '
            'members feared that “last year’s lauded and substantial uplift” '
            'of £16.5bn over four years would “simply be used to plug '
            'financial holes across its programmes” because the MoD could not '
            'give assurances to the contrary. The prime minister announced the '
            'extra capital spending nearly a year ago, promising it would lead '
            'to “a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces” – '
            'including the introduction of laser weapons. But at the time the '
            'MoD also faced a £13bn shortfall in its equipment budget, '
            'stemming from historic overspending, which had forced it to '
            'reduce the numbers of new Challenger 3 tanks, P-8 submarine '
            'hunting maritime patrol aircraft and Type 26 frigates. A total of '
            '£4bn had already been spent on the heavily delayed Ajax out of '
            '“whole life costs of £5.5bn,” the committee noted, yet only 14 '
            'vehicles – 2% of the total requirement – had been delivered by '
            'contractor General Dynamics for testing. One year ago, the MoD '
            'thought Ajax would initially enter service in the summer of 2021 '
            '– but this date was not met and the issues over vibration and '
            'noise are so serious that 310 service personnel were undergoing '
            'tests to see if their hearing had been permanently damaged. The '
            'noise and vibration problems dated back to December 2018 but the '
            'MPs voiced concern that the MoD was still in the dark about the '
            'cause. “Despite the length of time the department has known about '
            'this issue, there is still no definitive information on the '
            'source of the noise and vibration,” the PAC said. Eight '
            'programmes were rated either “amber/red or red” by senior '
            'officials responsible for delivering them on a traffic light '
            'scheme used across government for rating the progress of major '
            'procurement projects. Of broader concern, the PAC said, was the '
            'MoD’s apparent inability to learn from its mistakes despite 13 '
            'formal reviews of defence procurement over 35 years. “We were '
            'therefore shocked to learn that the department had only '
            'established a central register of learning from experience (LFE) '
            'in December 2020,” the MPs added. “Experience shows that there is '
            'a need for reflection and openness earlier in the process to '
            'avoid further catastrophes like Ajax.” The MoD frequently cited '
            'the complexity of the programmes to explain why they had fallen '
            'behind, but sceptical MPs said this was not the case. Such '
            'arguments aimed to “excuse the fact” that the MoD and its '
            'suppliers “failed to produce more realistic costings and '
            'schedules”, the committee concluded. An MoD spokesperson said: '
            '“This report reflects the complex challenges of delivering '
            'defence capability for our armed forces, but also the commitment '
            'and professionalism required to keep our people and the UK’s '
            'interests safe, by purchasing world-class equipment such as '
            'Lightning II stealth fighter jets, and the Queen Elizabeth '
            'aircraft carriers.”',

{'article': 'Women diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 35 face a '
            'higher risk of it spreading, according to the first global study '
            'of its kind. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer, '
            'with 2.3 million people diagnosed every year. Survival rates are '
            'generally good, which is largely because of screening, early '
            'diagnosis and improved treatment. However, until now, little has '
            'been known about the risk of secondary breast cancer, where the '
            'disease spreads to other parts of the body and becomes incurable. '
            'A meta analysis of more than 400 studies has found the risk of '
            'breast cancer spreading to another part of the body ranges from '
            '6% to 22%. The results of the study are being presented at the '
            'sixth International Consensus Conference for Advanced Breast '
            'Cancer . The findings also suggest certain women face a higher '
            'risk, including those diagnosed with breast cancer under the age '
            'of 35, those with larger tumours when initially diagnosed and '
            'those with specific types of the disease, for example luminal B. '
            'Kotryna Temcinaite, senior research communications manager at the '
            'charity Breast Cancer Now, said the analysis “provides helpful '
            'insight into who is most at risk”. “About 1,000 women in the UK '
            'die each month from incurable secondary breast cancer,” she said. '
            '“We desperately need to learn more about this devastating disease '
            'so that we can find new ways to improve treatment, care and '
            'support for people living with it, and for those living in fear '
            'of a diagnosis. “The data shows that people diagnosed with '
            'primary breast cancer aged 35 years or younger have the greatest '
            'chance of developing secondary breast cancer. The study also '
            'highlights that the size of the tumour, the type of breast cancer '
            'and the length of time since primary diagnosis can impact a '
            'person’s risk. “Secondary breast cancer can develop many years '
            'after an initial cancer diagnosis, so it’s vital that we '
            'understand it better and find new ways to prevent it.” For the '
            'study, researchers analysed data on tens of thousands of women '
            'across more than 400 studies from North and South America, '
            'Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The analysis suggests the '
            'overall risk of metastasis for most breast cancer patients is '
            'between 6% and 22%. Researchers say the range is broad because '
            'the risk varies significantly depending on a whole range of '
            'different factors. For example, women first diagnosed under the '
            'age of 35 have a 12.7% to 38% risk of their breast cancer coming '
            'back and spreading to other parts of the body, while women aged '
            '50 years or older have a risk of 3.7% to 28.6%. “This may be '
            'because younger women have a more aggressive form of breast '
            'cancer or because they are being diagnosed at a later stage,” '
            'said the presenter of the study, Dr Eileen Morgan, of the '
            'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). “Breast '
            'cancer is the most common form of cancer in the world,” she said. '
            '“Most women are diagnosed when their cancer is confined to the '
            'breast or has only spread to nearby tissue. But in some women, '
            'the cancer will grow and spread to other parts of the body or '
            'come back in a different part of the body several years after the '
            'end of their initial treatment. “At this point the cancer becomes '
            'much harder to treat and the risk of dying is higher. However, we '
            'don’t really know how many people develop metastatic breast '
            'cancer because cancer registries have not been routinely '
            'collecting this data.” The study also found women with specific '
            'types of breast cancer appeared to have a higher risk of it '
            'spreading, for example those with a type of cancer called luminal '
            'B. Those with this form had a 4.2% to 35.5% risk of it spreading '
            'compared with 2.3% to 11.8% risk in women diagnosed with luminal '
            'A cancer. Dr Shani Paluch-Shimon, a member of the conference’s '

{'article': 'She admits that, to the human eye at least, her new installation '
            'may turn out a little garish – clashing colours, odd shapes, '
            'curious juxtapositions – but the artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg '
            'doesn’t mind that at all. Ginsberg’s 55-metre long piece, which '
            'is taking shape at the eco-visitor attraction the Eden Project in '
            'Cornwall, is not designed, like most art, to please humans, but '
            'rather to appeal to bees, butterflies, moths, wasps and other '
            'endangered pollinators. “It means that I’ve ended up with this '
            'mad-looking design,” said Ginsberg in a break from the chilly, '
            'muddy business of autumn planting. “There are strange '
            'juxtapositions of shapes and patterns and colours that no '
            'gardener would think of planting. It is designed to be of '
            'greatest benefit to pollinators, suiting their tastes rather than '
            'ours.” The piece, Pollinator Pathmaker, should be in full bloom '
            'by late spring or early summer and new editions of the work are '
            'to be planted in London and Berlin. Ginsberg was originally '
            'trying to dream up a piece on pollinators when the thought struck '
            'her: “Why not create a sculpture for the pollinators rather than '
            'about them?” At Eden, Ginsberg has worked with professional '
            'gardeners, experts in pollination and a master beekeeper, Rodger '
            'Dewhurst, but a surprising team member is the string theory '
            'physicist Przemek Witaszczyk, of Jagiellonian University, Kraków, '
            'who helped create an algorithm for the piece. Witaszczyk factored '
            'in elements such as the shape and style of journeys taken by '
            'different pollinators and when individual flowers come into bloom '
            'to make sure conditions are good for as long as possible. “We '
            'want to serve the greatest number of pollinators,” said '
            'Ginsberg.\n'
            'Horticulturists, students, apprentices and volunteers have braved '
            'dismal conditions to plant thousands of plants, which will erupt '
            'into crazy colours at the Eden Project’s Wild Edge Zone, '
            'stretching around the perimeter slopes of the gardens and visible '
            'from across the site. Another crucial element of the project is '
            'the launch on Wednesday of a website allowing people to use the '
            'algorithm to design their own unique version of her work. Users '
            'can input the size of the patch they want to plant, the position '
            'of their garden and soil conditions, then see a 3D visualisation '
            'of their unique garden bloom on their screen. The images that '
            'emerge are in themselves a work of art, each plant hand-painted '
            'by Ginsberg. Some of the specimens included on the site are as '
            'extraordinary as the pollinators that will benefit from them, '
            'such as Echium pininana, a rare example of a plant that produces '
            'nectar across the whole day, and Cynara cardunculus, the '
            'artichoke thistle, which is a valuable source of nectar for '
            'bumblebees. Ginsberg sees this as “an international cultural '
            'campaign” and an “interspecies art experiment” to help save '
            'endangered species of pollinating insects. She hopes people will '
            'grow these in whatever space they have available – at home, in '
            'fields, community gardens, even in a window box if this is all '
            'the space they have. The artist admits the gardens could be '
            'expensive if they covered a large, intensively planted area, but '
            'the cost could be kept down in more modest schemes. “I hope we '
            'can create the largest ever climate-positive artwork together by '
            'planting living artworks for pollinators around the world.” The '
            'Pollinator Pathmaker project is part of Create a Buzz, a '
            'three-year programme for the Eden Project that includes new '
            'plantings of fields of wild flowers and a range of community and '
            'education projects. Misha Curson, senior curator at the Eden '
            'Project, described Pollinator Pathmaker as a “mould-breaking '
            'commission”, combining technology, conservation, horticulture and '
            'visual arts. “It’s a really powerful way of helping us as human '
            'beings think beyond our own needs and wants and consider the '
            'impact of our actions,” she said.',

{'article': 'Ministers have launched a three-week TV advertising blitz to '
            'recruit care workers, as a new mandatory Covid vaccination law '
            'takes effect that some operators warn could force out a quarter '
            'of their staff. The campaign will run from Wednesday on ITV, '
            'Channel 4 and Sky to help fill 105,000 vacancies with people who '
            'embody “kindness, compassion and resilience”, said Sajid Javid, '
            'the health secretary.\n'
            'The launch comes amid a staffing crisis in social care, with '
            'burnout, Brexit and low pay fuelling the exodus of staff and '
            'forcing care operators to cut their bed capacity. Frontline care '
            'home staff will be required to have two Covid jabs from 11 '
            'November or face redundancy. A similar policy is being considered '
            'for homecarers and on Tuesday the Homecare Association said some '
            'members have warned it would reduce their staff rosters by over '
            '25%. Of 150 homecare providers surveyed, 90% thought recruitment '
            'would become harder and over 80% thought they would need to '
            'dismiss staff as a result. A quarter of homecare workers have '
            'still not had two doses of vaccine. “This creates a serious risk '
            'that homecare will not be available for tens of thousands of '
            'older and disabled people who are wholly reliant on support,” '
            'said Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of the industry body. With '
            'the hospitality industry and retailers including Amazon luring '
            'care workers with better wages, unions have argued a pay increase '
            'from the current £9.01 median hourly wage is needed to boost '
            'recruitment. Many care managers have also seen staff switch to '
            'the NHS. The advertising campaign uses the slogan “made with '
            'care” and shows care workers taking people on trips to the '
            'seaside, exercising, swimming and getting dressed. A voiceover '
            'says: “There’s no better time to become a care worker”. '
            'Recruitment is not just a short-term problem. An ageing '
            'population means 500,000 further new care staff will be needed by '
            '2035. “We are investing record amounts into social care making '
            'this an exciting time to join the workforce and play an important '
            'role in helping to develop a world-leading social care system as '
            'we bring forward our plans for reform later this year,” said care '
            'minister Gillian Keegan.\n'
            'But the shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said: “In the face of '
            'overwhelming staff shortages, social care needs a detailed plan '
            'to transform staff pay, training and terms and conditions more '
            'than this TV advertising drive. There will be no new money for '
            'social care from the government’s so-called levy for at least '
            'three years, and nothing in the budget except confirmation of a '
            'national insurance hike on the very frontline workers we need to '
            'recruit.” Gavin Edwards, national officer for care at the trade '
            'union Unison, said: “If the government is serious about '
            'recruitment, its first move should be to ensure care workers get '
            'a decent pay rise. Any ad campaign pushing a job without sick '
            'pay, where poor treatment and exploitation are rife, will '
            'struggle to succeed.”',

{'article': 'Hundreds of the world’s biggest banks and pension funds with '
            'assets worth $130tn have committed themselves to a key goal in '
            'limiting greenhouse gas emissions, the UK government will '
            'announce on Wednesday. The pledge by more than 450 financial '
            'institutions in 45 countries is intended to be one of the top '
            'achievements by the UK hosts of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, and '
            'comes as some of the other aims of the summit – chiefly, setting '
            'the world on a path to limit global heating to 1.5C – are looking '
            'hard to reach. Finance is key to the massive economic '
            'transformation required to move away from fossil fuels and reach '
            'net zero so the global economy can be run without damaging the '
            'climate. But experts and campaigners cast doubt on the '
            'government’s finance claims, pointing out that the banks making '
            'the pledge are still free to pour cash into fossil fuels, and '
            'need only divert a small slice of their funding to low-carbon '
            'ends in the next decade. News of the pledge came at the end of '
            'the second full day of the Cop26 conference in Glasgow as world '
            'leaders finished their addresses and negotiators were preparing '
            'to thrash out details that could form the basis of a final '
            'communique next weekend. On another frantic day of announcements, '
            'the key developments included: UK prime minister Boris Johnson '
            'said he was “cautiously optimistic” about reaching a deal to keep '
            'the 1.5C target on track. Returning to a football analogy in '
            'which he had said the world was the equivalent of 5-1 down, he '
            'declared on Monday evening that the score was now “more like 5-2 '
            'or 5-3”. US president Joe Biden announced a plan by 90 countries '
            'to control methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Under the '
            'agreement, which does not include major emitters Russia and '
            'China, emissions of methane would fall 30% by the end of the '
            'decade. In another multinational deal, more than 40 countries '
            'including the UK, US, EU, India, China and Australia signed up to '
            'a plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies '
            'around the world. By collaborating on things like hydrogen '
            'production and electric vehicles, the members of the Breakthrough '
            'Alliance hope to bring forward the “tipping point” at which green '
            'technology is more affordable than fossil-fuel technology. The '
            'group of countries with the most ambitious climate targets, known '
            'as the High Ambition Coalition, were boosted by the announcement '
            'that the US would be rejoining their ranks after withdrawing from '
            'the Paris agreement entirely under former president Donald Trump. '
            'Observers said the move would strengthen efforts to stay on track '
            'for the target of 1.5C of heating. On Tuesday night, Rishi Sunak, '
            'the chancellor of the exchequer, said the City of London would '
            'become the world’s first “net zero finance centre”, and set out '
            'new rules forcing public companies to report on their plans to '
            'achieve net zero emissions. He said: “I’m proud that under the '
            'UK’s leadership, the number of financial firms committed to net '
            'zero plans has tripled, with the assets now covered totalling '
            '$130tn. Harnessing the trillions of dollars controlled by these '
            'companies in the fight against climate change is crucial. So I’ve '
            'announced new requirements for firms to publish their net zero '
            'transition plans. Together we can provide the cash the world '
            'needs to stop catastrophic climate change.” The finance pledge, '
            'known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), '
            'will mean that by 2050 all of the assets under management by the '
            'institutions involved will be aligned with net zero emissions. '
            'Economists have estimated that about $100tn in investment is '
            'likely to be needed in the next three decades to meet the net '
            'zero goal, so in theory GFANZ will provide more than enough cash '
            'to meet the goal. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of '
            'England, now a UK and UN climate envoy, said: “The architecture '
            'of the global financial system has been transformed to deliver '
            'net zero. We now have the essential plumbing in place to move '
            'climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so '
            'that every financial decision takes climate change into account … '
            '[This] rapid, and large-scale, increase in capital commitment to '
            'net zero, through GFANZ, makes the transition to a 1.5C world '
            'possible.” But experts told the Guardian the claims were '
            'overblown. The $130tn figure refers to the assets the firms have '
            'under management, only a small proportion of which – about a '
            'third – will be devoted to low-carbon investments in the crucial '
            'next decade, when emissions must be halved to keep temperatures '
            'from rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Simon '
            'Youel of the Positive Money campaign group said: “Banks may be '
            'preparing to scale up investment in ‘green’ activities, but this '
            'announcement says nothing about financial firms’ investments in '
            'new fossil fuel projects. States must introduce restrictions '
            'against new fossil fuel investments if we are to have a chance of '
            'keeping 1C alive.” Sunak has been accused of blocking green '
            'measures and is said to oppose the net zero agenda within '
            'government. He barely mentioned the climate in his recent '
            'comprehensive spending review, his budgets have contained few '
            'green measures and many high-carbon policies, and his speech in '
            'Glasgow is virtually the first time he has acknowledged Cop26. '
            'Sam Alvis, head of economy at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: '
            '“It is definite progress that the chancellor has got the Treasury '
            'on the pitch at Cop26. But trillions of dollars are still flowing '
            'to fossil fuels every day and voluntary measures have not got us '
            'far enough. To keep the 1.5C target alive, governments will need '
            'to regulate companies not just to publish transition plans but '
            'have strict criteria with legal bite on their credibility and '
            'pace.” Given the failure of wealthy nations to live up to their '
            'finance promises, diplomats from other parts of the world have '
            'turned the credibility tables on the donors. The foreign '
            'secretary of India, Harsh Vardhan Shringla said it was time for '
            'rich nations to face the same credibility checks on finance that '
            'developing countries are expected to accept on emissions cuts. '
            '“There are a lot of commitments that are made, but not seen '
            'through,” he said. “The pressure on climate action should be '
            'equal to the pressure on climate finance. It is not enough just '
            'to set the targets, there also needs to be a means to deliver. '
            'There should be tangible timelines, tangible monitoring.”',

            'scrapped the upgrade had a planned in-service date of 2024 – '
            'seven years late. The programme was described as an “abject '
            'failure” by the Commons defence select committee in March – which '
            'was “symptomatic of the extremely weak management of army '
            'equipment programmes … in recent years”. HMS Queen Elizabeth and '
            'HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carriers – £2.5bn overspend The cost '
            'of building two largest ships in the history of the Royal Navy '
            'soared from an initial estimate of £3.9bn – when the project was '
            'commissioned under Labour in 2007 – to £6.4bn. A “pain sharing” '
            'agreement had to be signed by the MoD in 2013 with contractors – '
            'BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales – in which the total budget was '
            'first increased to £6bn, before ending up at £6.4bn. But in '
            'procuring the carriers – both of which have now been accepted '
            'into service – the MoD had to make cuts. The original plan was to '
            'equip both vessels with catapult launchers for aircraft, but they '
            'were abandoned on grounds of cost, leaving the new UK ships '
            'lagging behind capabilities boasted by the US and China. A '
            'further £10.5bn has been set aside to equip the carriers with F35 '
            'Lightning II jets from Lockheed Martin, although approved budget '
            'has increased four times since 2017, by a total of £1.4bn. '
            'Meanwhile, a related Crowsnest radar system for the carriers and '
            'allied ships is 29 months late because, the National Audit Office '
            'said, “neither the department nor industry understood the '

            'submarines – seven years delay Britain’s £31bn replacement for '
            'its ageing Vanguard class Trident nuclear submarines has been '
            'plagued by delay since first approved in 2007. The first '
            'submarine was initially due to come into service in 2024, then '
            '2028, and now the “early 2030s” according to the MoD. The four '
            'existing Vanguard submarines, each carrying Britain’s independent '
            'nuclear submarines, were originally built to last 25 years, '
            'meaning they would have been out of service between 2017 and '
            '2024. Their life has been guaranteed by a series of extensions, '
            'but they will have to last well over 30 years. Poor management of '

{'article': 'The heatwaves and wildfires that caused devastation in Europe '
            'this summer would not have happened without global heating, new '
            'analysis shows. The summer of 2021 was the hottest on record in '
            'the continent, with average temperatures about 1C above normal. '
            'The elevated heat caused wildfires and premature deaths. '
            'Researchers have calculated how much more likely the climate '
            'crisis made the high temperatures. For almost all of the past 150 '
            'years, the expected frequency of a European summer as hot as 2021 '
            'was no higher than once every 10,000 years. But since the 1990s, '
            'as carbon emissions continued to soar, the expected frequency has '
            'rocketed to reach once every three years. The analysis is a stark '
            'reminder to the leaders meeting at the Cop26 climate summit in '
            'Glasgow that global heating is causing terrible damage to lives '
            'and livelihoods. If countries do not achieve drastic reductions '
            'in carbon emissions by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050, the record '
            'heat of 2021 will strike every year by the end of the century, '
            'the scientists say. Despite the extraordinary increase in '
            'likelihood of record heat in recent years, Nikos Christidis at '
            'the Met Office, who led the analysis, said: “These kinds of '
            'results are no longer surprising. Climate change is already '
            'making our weather extremes more severe.” “Extreme events are the '
            'new norm,” said Prof Petteri Taalas, the head of the UN World '
            'Meteorological Organization. A European temperature record of '
            '48.8C was set in Sicily in August. “Cop26 is a make-or-break '
            'opportunity to put us back on track,” Taalas said.\n'
            'The analysis used 14 climate models and scores of model runs to '
            'calculate how frequently the record summer of 2021 is expected to '
            'occur in today’s human-influenced climate, compared with a '
            'climate with no human influence. The research analysed the period '
            'from June to August and covered all of Europe, as far east as '
            'Yekaterinburg in Russia. For large stretches of the 20th century, '
            'the estimated frequency of such a hot summer in a world without '
            'climate change was more than one in 10,000 years. “This event was '
            'so rare, it was nearly impossible to calculate a probability,” '
            'Christidis said. The same scientific approach has shown clear '
            'links between global heating and other severe weather. The '
            'record-breaking heatwave in the Siberian Arctic in January and '
            'February 2020 was made at least 600 times more likely, while the '
            'terrible floods in Germany and Belgium in July were made up to '
            'nine times more likely. Prof Peter Stott, also at the Met Office, '
            'said: “We can be more confident than we have ever been about '
            'linking extreme weather events to climate change. The science is '
            'clear that the faster we reduce our emissions of greenhouse '
            'gases, the more we can avoid the most severe impacts.” “The new '
            'study is another stark reminder of just what 1.2C [of global '
            'heating to date] means,” said Friederike Otto, at Imperial '
            'College London, who conducted the Siberian study. “I really do '
            'not want to imagine the summers we’d have at 2.7C.” She said '
            'looking at large regions gives a stronger climate change signal '
            'than smaller areas. Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham '
            'Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of '
            'Economics, said: “The study shows clearly that the severe '
            'intensity of this summer’s heatwave was due to man-made climate '
            'change resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and other human '
            'activities. “The cost to humans and wildlife was substantial, '
            'with heatwave conditions killing people across the continent, and '
            'the enhanced evaporation of higher temperatures turning forests '
            'into fuel for devastating wildfires. “These extreme temperature '
            'events in Europe will continue to increase in severity and '
            'frequency for at least the next 30 years, until the world reaches '
            'net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.” Other previous studies '
            'have shown an extreme heatwave in 2017 that saw deadly forest '
            'fires blazing in Portugal and Spain was made 10 times more likely '
            'by global warming. In Portugal, 64 people died. Previous work has '
            'also demonstrated floods in England and France – as far back as '
            '2000 – were made significantly more likely by global heating.',

            'Hayman’s early onset dementia and probable chronic traumatic '
            'encephalopathy (CTE) diagnosis at the age of 41. Hayman played 45 '
            'Tests for the All Blacks between 2001-07, during which time he '
            'was considered the best tighthead prop in the game. He became one '

            'Newcastle and Toulon, winning three European titles with the '
            'French team, before retiring in 2015.\n'
            'Hayman revealed to Dylan Cleaver’s The Bounce the near- 450 '
            'professional games he played have taken an irreversible toll on '
            'his brain. “I spent several years thinking I was going crazy. At '
            'one stage that’s genuinely what I thought. It was the constant '
            'headaches and all these things going on that I couldn’t '
            'understand,” Hayman said. “At the time I felt indestructible. I '
            'never got injured, I trained bloody hard... but if I knew then '
            'what I know now, I don’t think I would have played post the '
            '[2007] World Cup. I think I would have stopped playing.” Hayman’s '
            'harrowing account of the effects of his early-onset dementia '
            'detailed alcohol abuse, suicidal thoughts and erratic behaviour; '
            'the latter leading to a suspended prison sentence in France after '
            'he admitted to charges of domestic violence. Since extensive '
            'testing in England revealed his diagnosis, Hayman has joined the '
            'landmark lawsuit being prepared for 150 former professional rugby '
            'players that claims rugby’s governing bodies, including World '
            'Rugby, failed to protect players from the risks caused by '
            'concussions and sub-concussions. All Blacks assistant coach John '
            'Plumtree, speaking from Rome ahead of Saturday’s Test against '
            'Italy, expressed his regret at Hayman’s situation. “It’s really '
            'sad,” Plumtree said. “Carl is a 45-Test All Black and he’s done a '
            'lot for New Zealand rugby. It’s a real sad situation if he’s '
            'struggling with dementia at such an early age. We’ve got a lot of '
            'empathy for that. He’s been a popular person in this environment '
            'so it’s not nice to hear about those stories.” Despite Hayman '
            'being the latest modern-day athlete to reveal extensive brain '
            'damage from contact sport, Plumtree believes rugby, and the All '
            'Blacks, have taken major strides in attempting to mitigate the '
            'effects of repeated head knocks. “We look at our laws now they '
            'really protect the head,” Plumtree said. “It has changed a lot. '
            'There’s greater awareness around it in all parts of the '
            'organisation from the top level down to us as coaches. We’re '
            'trying to minimise the accidents around the head as much as we '
            'can and we know the game is under pressure to do that. “We’ve got '
            'a responsibility as coaches to make sure the game is safe so '
            'parents want their kids to play. “If you look at the forwards, '
            'defence, backs, attack coach we all try and coach perfect '
            'technique whether it’s the high ball, tackle situation or the '
            'breakdown. The head is a protected area. “We know it’s not good '
            'for our game and we know we have to protect our players whether '
            'that’s at training or during a game. I hate seeing the head '
            'injuries. If you look at this tour we’ve been on we’ve had a '
            'couple of injuries but we haven’t had a concussion. “I think '
            'we’re going on the right path with the way we’re looking after '
            'our athletes. If you look at the stats now hopefully they’d say '
            'there’s less of it. “I feel sorry for Carl or any other players '
            'that are affected in this regard. I know he’s a good Taranaki '
            'farming boy and that’s my roots as well so it wasn’t a nice '
            'article to read.”\n'
            'World Rugby recently adopted independent concussion consultants '
            'to support the graduated return to play process in the elite '
            'game, and in September issued guidelines around reducing contact '
            'in training. These include limiting full contact to 15 minutes '
            'per week; 40 minutes of controlled contact utilising tackle '
            'shields and pads, and 30 minutes of live set piece training with '
            'lineouts, scrums and mauls at a high intensity. The '
            'recommendations could soon be mandated, with Test teams '
            'potentially obliged to follow guidelines in order to compete at '
            'the 2023 World Cup. Plumtree explained training measures the All '
            'Blacks adopt to minimise contact such as using tackle shields '
            'rather than players to practise cleanout drills, and closing the '
            'distance between contacts to reduce impact. “We’re minimising the '
            'risk,” he said. “The players can train cleanout work on pads that '
            'are designed like a jackler so we’re not using a body for that '
            'type of training. It’s all designed to look after the players and '
            'train the perfect technique. As professional coaches we’ve got '
            'that responsibility. “The head is a protected place and those '
            'types of conversations are talked about all the time in the All '
            'Blacks.”',

            'the defender injured a hamstring in Manchester United’s 2-2 draw '
            'at Atalanta. The centre-back only returned for the 3-0 win at '

            'want to take a risk. On the first assessment it doesn’t look good '
            'but we will assess him again tomorrow.”\n'
            'As United’s defence was again a problem against Gian Piero '
            'Gasperini’s side the loss of Varane, for what might be a number '
            'of weeks, would be a setback. Solskjær, though, praised the '
            '“incredible” Cristiano Ronaldo after he was again United’s '
            'saviour when equalising twice – in added time of the first and '
            'second half – to earn what might prove an invaluable draw. It '
            'means United head Group F with seven points on goal difference '
            'from Villarreal with the Spanish club and Young Boys left to '
            'play. Ronaldo’s fourth and fifth strikes of the phase cancelled '
            'out Josip Illicic’s opener and Duván Zapata’s second, which had '
            'each given Atalanta the lead. Solskjær brushed off any concern '

            'have our roles and responsibilities,” the Norwegian said. '
            '“Cristiano is a leader in the group, he scores goals. I’m sure '

{'article': 'The Australian government has been criticised for prominently '
            'hosting a fossil fuel company at its pavilion at the Cop26 '
            'climate summit in Glasgow. The condemnation came as the Morrison '
            'government confirmed it would not join about 90 countries in '
            'backing the official launch of a global pledge to reduce '
            'emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas leaked during gas '
            'and coal extraction and released by livestock – by 30% by 2030.\n'
            'The Australian pavilion in the Scottish Event Campus exhibition '
            'centre has been a hub of activity during the first two days of '
            'the summit. With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, '
            'Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison’s address to '
            'the conference on Monday. Space in the pavilion has been '
            'dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest’s '
            'green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, '
            'which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern '
            'Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. '
            'Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos. At the front of '
            'the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba '
            'carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. '
            'Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go '
            'ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon '
            'credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction '
            'fund. Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus '
            'Taylor, joined Santos’ chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the '
            'pavilion to trumpet the announcement.\n'
            'The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as '
            'the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was “a '
            'pity” Australia had not signed up to the pledge and “a joke” that '
            'Santos had been given prime placement. “Look at the Australian '
            'stand – you’ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the '
            'insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy '
            'policy should be all about burning gas,” Turnbull told reporters. '
            '“The whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels. “We’ve got to '
            'cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. '
            'We can’t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push '
            'out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global '
            'warming now.” Taylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos '
            'chief while launching the government’s latest low-emissions '
            'technology statement – an annual update of its technology-driven '
            'approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority '
            'technologies chosen to get government support. The minister said '
            'Santos’ CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will '
            'capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a '
            '“very elegant project” that would allow it to produce gas while '
            'reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types '
            'of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production '
            'sites and in the development of “blue” hydrogen using gas. “We '
            'can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the '
            'production of hydrogen,” he said. “This is not new, it’s very, '
            'very important, it’s going to be particularly important for the '
            'gas industry.” Asked about the global methane pledge, he said '
            'Australia’s focus was “whole of economy, all gasses”. “We’re not '
            'setting sector-specific targets and we’re not setting '
            'gas-specific targets,” he said. Taylor last week claimed signing '
            'up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and '
            'the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to '
            'meet it would be to “start shooting your cattle”. Bill Hare, the '
            'chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was '
            'not correct. The government’s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has '
            'been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new '
            'technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its '
            'support for CCS technology – both burying greenhouse gases from '
            'industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using '
            'captured carbon dioxide to make products – includes $250m for a '
            '“CCS technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have '
            'committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet '
            'to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one '
            'operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in '
            'Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures '
            'only a portion of the emissions at the site. The Greens’ '
            'environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in '

            'hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for '
            'the gas industry”. The Australian Conservation Foundation said '
            'Australia was acting “shamelessly”. “Make no mistake, the '

            'backing renewable energy by adding “ultra low-cost solar” as a '
            'priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week '
            'when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions '
            'by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to '
            'producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said. '
            '“We welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production – green, blue '
            '– they are important,” he said. “You will see green growing '

{'article': 'Boris Johnson will back an unprecedented bid to overthrow an '
            'independent inquiry that found the former cabinet minister Owen '
            'Paterson committed an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules. Tory '
            'MPs will be instructed by party whips on Wednesday to avoid '
            'imposing an immediate 30-day suspension on their colleague by '
            'backing a motion that argues the initial probe by the '
            'parliamentary standards commissioner was flawed. Instead, a new '
            'committee would be set up to review the evidence.\n'
            'The body would be chaired by the Conservative backbencher John '
            'Whittingdale and consist of four other Tories, three Labour MPs '
            'and one from the Scottish National party tasked with examining '
            'ways of overhauling the standards process, including giving those '
            'accused the power of appeal and making it more consistent with '
            'the “principles of natural justice”. Andrea Leadsom, the former '
            'Commons leader, will propose the amendment during a debate on '
            'Wednesday about Paterson’s conduct and it is understood the chief '
            'whip, Mark Spencer, will tell other Tory MPs to support it. Last '
            'week an investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for '
            'standards, Kathryn Stone, concluded Paterson “repeatedly” used '
            'his position as an MP to benefit two firms who paid him as a '
            'consultant. Her report said he worked for Randox and Lynn’s '
            'Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards '
            'Agency and Department for International Development ministers '
            'about the companies. Paterson said he was not guilty and “a fair '
            'process would exonerate me”. He described the process as “a major '
            'contributory factor” in the death of his wife, Rose, who killed '
            'herself last year. A number of MPs are supporting Paterson and '
            'trying to overturn or dilute the standards committee '
            'recommendation of a 30-day suspension from parliament. The '
            'amendment set to be proposed by Leadsom tomorrow will say that a '
            'new committee should report its findings by the start of February '
            '2022, with a motion proposing changes to the standards committee '
            'system presented to the Commons within five days.\n'
            'Other bids will also be launched to spare Paterson a long ban '
            'from parliament that could trigger a byelection. Tory MPs Dr '
            'Julian Lewis, William Wragg and Peter Bone have proposed he face '
            'no sanction “on compassionate grounds” related to his wife’s '
            'death. Whether the amendments are selected will be a matter for '
            'the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. He will announce on Wednesday '
            'afternoon which – if any – will be voted on when MPs begin a '
            '90-minute debate on the report into Paterson released last week. '
            'Bernard Jenkin, one of four Tory MPs who sits on the standards '
            'committee, recused himself from discussions during the '
            'investigation as he is a close friend of Paterson’s. Jenkin was '
            'said to have played a role in mobilising MPs to vote to prevent '
            'his suspension. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party '
            'leader, has also tried to drum up support for Paterson among the '
            '2019 intake of Tory MPs. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and chair of '
            'the standards committee, said Leadsom’s amendment would be '
            'unjust. He told the Guardian: “The definition of injustice is you '
            'change the rules in the midst of the process. This would create a '
            'special system for one person and is completely unfair.” His '
            'committee found Paterson broke multiple rules when he lobbied the '
            'government on behalf of Randox, a clinical diagnostics company, '
            'and Lynn’s Country Foods, a processor and distributor of meat '
            'products. The committee’s report said: “No previous case of paid '
            'advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of '
            'behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests.” '
            'Paterson claimed he was acting as a whistleblower when he raised '
            'concerns about bacon and milk standards with the Food Standards '
            'Agency and Department for International Development but the '
            'commissioner said his mitigation “did not meet the conditions for '
            'this exemption”. On only two occasions since the second world war '
            'have suspensions been contested in the Commons, it is thought, '
            'but never has one been downgraded or removed. A senior Tory MP '
            'said: “It’s a question of tempering justice with mercy. I do '
            'wonder – in the context of what he’s been through – if triggering '
            'a recall petition is an appropriate sanction.” Thangham '
            'Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, said if Leadsom’s '
            'amendment passed, it would signal a “return to the worst of the '
            '1990s Tory sleaze culture”. She added: “The Tories want to '
            'jettison the systems that has served us well and which has been a '
            'vital part of rebuilding public trust after the dark days of Tory '
            'sleaze this government seems determined to return to.”',

{'article': 'Neil Warnock’s historic night turned sour as his Middlesbrough '
            'side were beaten 3-1 by Luton at Kenilworth Road. Warnock took '
            'charge of his 1,602nd game, an English football record, and Josh '
            'Coburn’s 15th-minute goal put Boro ahead. But Luton turned the '
            'game on its head in the second half with three goals in five '
            'minutes from Sonny Bradley, Elijah Adebayo and Harry Cornick.\n'
            '“That’s football, isn’t it,” Warnock said afterwards. “I can’t '
            'fault them for effort, it’s just that determination to keep your '
            'goal intact really that we haven’t got enough of at the minute, '
            'with the lads that we’ve got missing. “We’ve lost the game, three '
            'simple goals we’ve given away and yet it’s a game I think we '
            'should have won, so it’s disappointing for me on two fronts.” The '
            '72-year-old manager added: “[Kenilworth Road] is a good football '
            'ground. Places like QPR, this – I love the atmosphere like that. '
            'I think [Luton fans] respect me, they’ve always given me stick '
            'here, and I always give it back if I can – there’s not enough '
            'good humour like that.” Luton’s manager, Nathan Jones, was keen '
            'to pay tribute to Warnock after the game. “You only have respect '
            'for him,” he said. “If you get to 100 games you’ve been a decent '
            'manager … if you get to 1,602, you have to do something very, '
            'very well. Fair play, he’s had a wonderful career. You look back '
            'in awe and say that’s the career you want to carve out.” Coventry '
            'missed the chance to move into the top three, going down 2-1 at '
            'home against Swansea. The away side were two up inside 12 minutes '
            'through Jamie Paterson and Joel Piroe and, although Kyle '
            'McFadzean pulled one back in the 28th minute, they could not find '
            'an equaliser and lost their first home game this season. The '
            'Swansea manager, Russell Martin, was full of praise for his two '
            'goalscorers after his side’s fourth win in five games. “Joel and '
            'Jamie have been incredible for us,” he said. “Forget all the '
            'goals, the defensive job Joel does for the team is really '
            'appreciated. Jamie, you run out of superlatives to describe '
            'him.”\n'
            'Birmingham were 3-0 winners against Bristol City, with Riley '
            'McGree scoring the opener on his birthday. Scott Hogan and Gary '
            'Gardner made sure of the points in the second half at St '
            'Andrew’s. After the game the Birmingham manager, Lee Bowyer, said '
            'that McGree, who is on loan from the MLS side Charlotte FC, will '

            'time for the Blades but Lewis Grabban levelled matters five '
            'minutes later. Fifth-placed Huddersfield looked like they would '

{'article': 'The genius of the modern Manchester United is that for all the '
            'attention lavished upon them, for all the granular analysis they '
            'attract, they remain a largely unknown quantity. When they take '
            'the field, you genuinely have no idea what to expect from them. '
            'And not just in terms of results, either: tactics, personnel, '
            'effort and mood are all equally unforeseeable. They are the '
            'hyperactive toddlers of English football, equally capable of '
            'moments of startling insight and unfettered joy as they are of '
            'throwing valuable household ornaments into the toilet. Naturally, '
            'this is a quality greatly prized by Ed Woodward and the Glazer '
            'family, whose entire strategy has seemed to revolve around '
            'reimagining this working-class football club as a brandable '
            'entertainment product.\n'
            'Even the fans still seem to be on board for the time being, '
            'recognising – correctly – that the virtues of a watertight '
            'five-year plan and a coherent backroom infrastructure must '
            'occasionally take a back seat to the haptic thrill of watching '
            'your clump of highly paid frauds pull off yet another sensational '
            'comeback. And lo, on a chilly Lombardian night United again went '
            'behind, again came back, again changed formations before '
            'half-time, again went behind, again came back, again kept the '
            'United content machine well and truly in business. For Ole Gunnar '
            'Solskjær, who has been in the last chance saloon so many times he '
            'knows the bar staff by name and has long since memorised all the '
            'questions on the quiz machine, it was another night that felt '
            'like it might settle everything and yet seemed to settle nothing. '
            'His teamsheet offered us a handy window into the confusion. Four '
            'of the back five that had served United so well against Tottenham '
            'on Saturday were in operation again. So was Paul Pogba, but in a '
            'porous midfield three alongside the wandering Bruno Fernandes and '
            'the overloaded Scott McTominay. Up front Marcus Rashford played '
            'off Cristiano Ronaldo, an appropriate role for someone so used to '
            'feeding children. And so it was a system set up for defensive '
            'cover. But also dominating possession. But also playing the ball '
            'through midfield. But also the counterattack. An injury to '
            'Raphaël Varane forced Solskjær to switch to a 4-3-3 shortly '
            'before the break and, true to form, by the closing minutes United '
            'had reverted to their default of simply flinging four forwards on '
            'to the pitch and letting them get on with it. It worked. It will '
            'work most weeks; individually United are that good. Yet there is '
            'a basic irony in the fact that a squad assembled for domination '
            'is so poor without the ball that they condemn themselves to long '
            'periods of being dominated.\n'
            'Both Atalanta goals were good examples of this. At first glance '
            'Josip Ilicic’s goal was crafted by the fumbling limbs of David de '
            'Gea, who let the ball squirm through him like a tired fielder at '
            'deep square leg. But really the situation was created when Remo '
            'Freuler was allowed to advance from midfield and play a simple '
            'unpressured pass into the channel for Duván Zapata to cross. '
            'Zapata’s goal came from an elementary long ball over the top from '
            'José Luis Palomino. And against a team as quick and fluid as '
            'Atalanta, United’s approach did occasionally smack of: go on, you '
            'do something and as soon as we work out what it is, we’ll try and '
            'defend it. The problem here wasn’t effort: United’s three '
            'midfielders ran more than anyone else on the pitch in the first '
            'half. Much has been written and said in recent weeks about '
            'United’s reluctance to press from the front, but the real issue '
            'here isn’t so much that United don’t press, it’s that some of '
            'them do, and some of them don’t, and almost never all of them at '
            'the same time. Fernandes is an enthusiastic presser, although – '
            'arrestingly – often the only one. Rashford wants to press but '
            'isn’t really very good at it.\n'
            'Ronaldo, meanwhile, presses with all the enthusiasm of the guy '
            'who fumbles for his wallet when the bill arrives, but has no '
            'intention of actually getting it out. And when you have scored as '
            'many goals as he has, decided as many games, it’s probably a '
            'little late in the day to start quibbling about his defensive '
            'output. He’s here now, he’s going to play, and very often he’s '
            'going to rescue a game with two goals out of absolutely nothing '
            'and keep your Champions League campaign on track single-handedly. '
            'This is the Faustian pact you willingly enter when you turn your '
            'team into a Ronaldo-pleasure machine. The studio pundit sees a '
            'defence in chaos and a midfield overrun and a star striker simply '
            'strolling around waiting for someone to give him the ball. But '
            'the chaos isn’t the flaw in the system; it is the system. It’s '
            'baked in, priced in, hardwired. Ronaldo will solve the problems '
            'that Ronaldo creates. Ronaldo will restore the supremacy that '
            'Ronaldo has helped to surrender. And if that sounds like a recipe '
            'for a team powered by chance, vibes and pure, blind circumstance: '
            'well, that’s just the genius in action.',

{'article': 'Barcelona’s fate remains in their own hands, which may not have '

            'on to Fati’s 69th-minute strike. Two 1-0 wins, both of them '
            'against Dynamo, have given them six points. “It’s hard to see '
            'Barcelona qualifying for the next round,” Mircea Lucescu, the '
            'Dynamo coach, had said before this game, warning: “Benfica '

            'be true and certainly was not disproved here, but for now '
            'Barcelona have done enough to occupy second place in Group E. '
            'Just. For all that the situation was dramatic, hope lay in what '
            'had been seen a fortnight ago at the Camp Nou and was quickly '
            'apparent again inside the Olympic Stadium: Barcelona may not be '
            'that good, but Dynamo are the team that they should be best '
            'equipped to defeat. The only team, indeed, that they had even '
            'scored against. Here they did so again, getting the vital goal at '
            'the point in which the doubts most took hold. Not that they '
            'entirely went away, even then.\n'
            'Sergi Barjuan, the interim coach, had insisted his side would '
            'press high and to begin with they did so, almost taking the lead '
            'after just three minutes when Memphis Depay bundled through '
            'challenges inside the Dynamo area and fired off a shot from '
            'barely five yards that Ilya Zabarnyi blocked. A quick clipped '
            'ball into the area from Sergio Busquets nearly brought another '
            'opportunity five minutes after and then Fati had a shot closed '
            'down. He too was a long way into the area, as was Jordi Alba when '
            'he swiped at Gavi’s cross on 15 minutes. That early momentum '
            'though faded and soon Dynamo were able to find a way out, '
            'reminding Barcelona of their fragility with a sudden dash up the '
            'right wing from Viktor Tsygankov. Released into the space behind '
            'Alba, he pulled a superb ball back for Mykola Shaparenko right by '
            'the penalty spot. The shot was scuffed horribly but it was enough '
            'to scare Barcelona and a new game started, Marc André ter Stegen '
            'having to save sharply from Carlos de Pena not long after.\n'
            'That was a relief: eight times this season, Barcelona had '
            'conceded from the first shot on target they had faced and there '
            'was more good news almost immediately when Robert Lewandowski '
            'scored the opener for Bayern Munich, putting them on course for a '
            'victory that would keep Benfica within Barcelona’s reach and '
            'ensure that the German champions would be already through as '
            'group leaders by the time Barcelona face them. Just as well, as '
            'control was slipping from them here. Emboldened, Dynamo pressed '
            'more insistently. Tsygankov slipped in Shaparenko whose low '
            'effort evaded Ter Stegen’s hand and went just wide of the near '
            'post. At the other end, Clément Lenglet’s diving header against '
            'the post was ruled out for offside anyway and Nico’s header hit '
            'his teammate Depay almost on the line. Barcelona’s productivity, '
            'though, was limited and their vulnerability concerning. Crosses '
            'continued to be the weapon to which they turned most often and '
            'the best chance of the opening 15 minutes of the second half came '
            'when Dynamo opened up Barcelona on the left and the ball came '
            'back to Oleksandr Karavaev to bend just past the far post.\n'
            'Then, an Oscar Mingueza ball fell to Fati and he turned, swung '
            'and sent the ball into the net for a goal that he dedicated to '
            'Sergio Agüero. Ter Stegen had to save from Serhi Sydorchuk then '
            'from Tsygankov, before Zabarnyi’s effort drifted just past the '
            'post, leaving Barcelona in second place.',

{'article': 'This was the same tired story of Manchester United’s season. A '
            'powder-puff rearguard, an errant midfield, an overreliance on '
            'Cristiano Ronaldo to somehow pull the result their way. And he '
            'did it: yet again. For the third time in Group F the Portuguese '
            'levelled at the last, his fifth strike of the group stage a low '
            'volley that avoided the amateurish United being consigned to '
            'their second defeat. Before Ronaldo’s intervention, the night’s '
            'chief culprits were the dismal Harry Maguire and Paul Pogba, the '
            '(supposed) leader of the defence and engine room, who were '
            'liabilities and, despite the late escape, the questions will '
            'continue regarding Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s position in the buildup '
            'to Saturday’s derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford.\n'
            'United’s shape and plan continues to be executed only '
            'intermittently – on Saturday Tottenham were convincingly beaten '
            '3-0; this time Solskjær’s side required a 91st-minute strike from '
            'their only consistent player to save them. United may head the '
            'standings on goal difference from Villarreal but they go to Spain '
            'next and it would be no surprise if they come unstuck there, and '
            'in the last match at home to Young Boys, and are eliminated, as '
            'they were last season. Control is a prime element of what United '
            'have lacked so far this season. So when Luke Shaw, Marcus '
            'Rashford and Ronaldo tapped the ball about and the latter bounced '
            'a shot at Juan Musso and, a little later, Scott McTominay’s '
            'effort deflected on to a post, it was an apt start. Pogba '
            'dispossessed Josip Ilicic near halfway to further suggest '
            'Solskjær’s men were switched on: this proved inaccurate as Ilicic '
            'began to display his craft, a neat reverse pass into Mario '
            'Pasalic wrong-footing United’s players for a the second time. '
            'After failing to heed these warnings, Ilicic struck. Loose '
            'defending allowed a Duván Zapata raid along the left to go '
            'unchecked and when he crossed the Slovenian beat David de Gea, '
            'the finish squirming under the goalkeeper’s body. Yet again those '
            'in red had placed themselves needlessly behind the eight ball, '
            'and raised the volume of a raucous home faithful. A mis-hit Shaw '
            'volley, Ronaldo barging Musso, and the Portuguese fluffing a '
            'header were the response but each time Atalanta broke United '
            'shuddered.\n'
            'On one occasion a high ball caught Maguire out, Zapata '
            'controlled, and United escaped only because his finished went '
            'sky-high. Only Eric Bailly’s flying intervention stopped Zapata '
            'doubling the lead, the opening arriving due to Pogba dawdling in '
            'possession. The Frenchman produced an unwanted replica of the '
            'error by leaving a pass too short for Rashford and suddenly '
            'Atalanta galloped forward. Solskjær, standing in the technical '
            'area, must have cursed inwardly, too, when Raphaël Varane was '
            'forced off injured a few minutes before the break. This caused a '
            'rejig: from the three-man defence to a back four, as Mason '
            'Greenwood entered to add an attacker. And, somehow, United '
            'fashioned an equaliser. Having appeared a bunch of players '
            'wondering if they might ever form a unified team, they clicked. '
            'It was impressive. Ronaldo found Greenwood who found Bruno '
            'Fernandes, whose slick backheel picked out Ronaldo again. He was '
            'never going to miss.\n'
            'How Solskjær’s side would perform in the second half was a '
            'conundrum, so erratic are they. If this is a team whose attack '
            'has to constantly bail out the defence, the chance that Fernandes '
            'failed to convert – from a Ronaldo delivery – seemed like it '
            'might be costly. As, too, Greenwood’s shot hammered against '
            'Musso’s left post on the angle. United’s tackles were clumsy, '
            'they could not escape their own territory, and the midfield and '
            'defence often went AWOL, as when Zapata was allowed to race clear '
            'at De Gea to retake the lead for Atalanta. Maguire flailed – as '
            'he has too often of late – and the Colombian striker finished '
            'well. The goal was flagged offside before VAR correctly overruled '
            'the decision. United had just over half an hour to rescue the '
            'contest – and their manager from the next round of criticism and '
            'doubt from his many naysayers. Yet unless Ronaldo and company '
            'were to work their magic for a countless time the prospects of '
            'this occurring felt bleak.\n'
            'But the remarkable 36-year-old did not disappoint. First, on came '
            'Nemanja Matic and Edinson Cavani as Solskjær hoped to somehow '
            'conjure a goal. His prayers were answered, as United’s talisman '
            'once again stepped up to be the hero. How much longer Ronaldo can '
            'continue the rescue act is fascinating to ponder. For United, '
            'though, it is all just not good enough.',

{'article': 'The mother of Cleo Smith has declared her “family is whole '

            'more than two weeks after she went missing from a campsite in '
            'remote Western Australia. Western Australia police said they had '
            'found Cleo alone in a house in Carnarvon, about 900km north of '
            'Perth, at 1am on Wednesday. They arrested a man a short time '
            'later. The WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson, told the ABC '
            'that police had a 36-year-old man in custody. He said there was '
            '“no family connection”. The house she was found in was declared a '
            'forensic scene with police officers combing through it, looking '
            'for extra evidence that will help piece together how she was '
            'taken. “To find a little girl, a vulnerable little girl, after 18 '
            'days, you know, obviously people think the worst, but '
            'importantly, hope was never lost,” Dawson said. “The fact she’s '
            'been found alive … I think Australia is rejoicing, you know, it '
            'is such a wonderful outcome.” Dawson said the community in WA, '
            'and particularly in Carnarvon, deserved credit for helping with '
            'the investigation after police received information about a car '
            'connected to her disappearance. Cleo’s mother, Ellie Smith, '
            'posted on Instagram at about 6am local time about her daughter’s '
            'discovery with the caption “our family is whole again”. The '
            'police deputy commissioner, Col Blanch, said police had broken '
            'into the locked house and found the girl in one of the rooms. '
            '“It’s my privilege to announce that in the early hours of this '
            'morning, the Western Australia police force rescued Cleo Smith,” '
            'he said. “Cleo is alive and well. One of the officers picked her '
            'up into his arms and asked her, ‘What’s your name?’ She said, ‘My '
            'name is Cleo’.”\n'
            'Cleo was reunited with her parents a short time later. The '
            'four-year-old vanished from the Blowholes campsite near Carnarvon '
            'on 16 October. Her mother was the last known person to see her. '
            'Smith said her daughter had woken up about 1.30am asking for '
            'water before going back to bed. In the morning Cleo and her '
            'sleeping bag were gone from the family’s tent. “This is the '
            'outcome we all hoped and prayed for,” Blanch said. The Carnarvon '
            'shire president, Eddie Smith, told 2GB radio he had realised '
            'something was going on when his phone started ringing on '
            'Wednesday. “My phone started to ring flat out and I knew there '
            'was something going on here,” he said. “Cleo Smith had been '
            'found. I rang the police and they told me it was correct.” '
            'Australia’s leaders were quick to express their joy at the news '
            'and to thank the police and others who had searched for Cleo over '
            'two harrowing weeks. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, called '
            'Cleo’s discovery “wonderful, relieving news”. “The fact that that '
            'nightmare has come to an end and our worst fears were not '
            'realised, is just a huge relief and a moment for great joy,” '
            'Morrison said during a press conference in Dubai on Wednesday. '
            'Morrison said Cleo’s disappearance had “captured the hearts of '
            'Australians as we felt such terrible sorrow for the family”. “I '
            'want to thank, particularly, all of the police and all of those '
            'who were involved in making sure that Cleo is safe and we are so '
            'thankful…I just thank God that Cleo is home and that she is '
            'safe,” Morrison said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it '
            'was “such happy news”. “To all those who tirelessly searched for '
            'this little girl, you deserve our thanks.” Blanch said the '
            'outcome was down to “some incredible police work”. Sign up to '
            'receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia '
            'every morning\n'
            '“I want to thank Cleo’s parents, the Western Australian community '
            'and the many volunteers. And of course, I want to thank my '
            'colleagues in the Western Australia police force.” The NSW police '
            'commissioner, Mick Fuller, told 2GB his WA counterpart, Dawson, '
            'told him he had broken down and cried at the news. Fuller said he '
            'had thought the chances of finding Cleo alive were “so slim”. '
            '“West Australian police never gave up on Cleo: it was good '
            'old-fashioned police work that resulted in her being found '
            'alive,” Fuller said. Blanch said the man in custody was being '
            'questioned by detectives. “We’ll have more to say on the rescue '
            'of Cleo as the day unfolds,” Blanch said. “For now – welcome home '
            'Cleo.” A press conference was expected to be held mid-morning '
            'Perth time. Det Insp Jon Rouse, the manager of victim '
            'identification at the Australian Centre to Counter Child '
            'Exploitation, said he had emailed colleagues in WA early on '
            'Wednesday morning to congratulate them. Rouse said he had seen '
            'the heartbreak when children could not be recovered, including '
            'the tragic case of the Queensland boy Daniel Morcombe, who was '
            'abducted from a bus stop in 2003. A taskforce of 100 police '
            'officers, led by Det Supt Rod Wilde, had been based out of '
            'Carnarvon for 18 days looking for clues into Cleo’s '
            'disappearance. They used reconnaissance planes to carry out '
            'real-time surveillance. The position of the zipper on the tent '
            'flap – too high for Cleo to reach – suggested she had not opened '
            'the tent herself. “The positioning of that zipper for the flap is '
            'one of the circumstances that has caused us to have grave '
            'concerns for Cleo’s safety,” Insp John Munday said five days into '
            'the search. That prompted police to pursue the “nightmare '
            'scenario” that she had been abducted. Cleo’s mother maintained '
            'throughout the ordeal that Cleo would never have left the tent on '
            'her own.',

{'article': 'Joe Biden launched a stinging attack on China on Tuesday for the '
            'failure of the country’s president, Xi Jinping, to show up to the '
            'Cop26 UN climate summit, and failing to show leadership on the '
            'climate crisis. The US president said it was a “big mistake” that '
            'his Chinese counterpart had chosen not to attend the summit, '
            'where more than 120 world leaders have spent the last two days '
            'discussing ways to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.\n'
            '“We showed up,” Biden told a press conference, speaking before '
            'world leaders departed, to leave the floor to their ministers and '
            'officials for two weeks of tense negotiations. “They didn’t show '
            'up … It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away,” he said, '
            'also criticising Russia and Vladimir Putin. “How do you do that '
            'and claim to have any leadership mantle?” China delivered a plan '
            'for emissions reductions on the eve of the conference that many '
            'analysts found disappointing. Under the plan, the world’s biggest '
            'emitter would cause emissions to peak by 2030 and reach net zero '
            'by 2060, targets it had already set more than a year ago and '
            'which if not improved will make it difficult for the world to '
            'stay within 1.5C, the threshold beyond which scientists warn some '
            'of the impacts of climate breakdown will become irreversible. '
            'Earlier in the day, Biden made a point of rejoining the “high '
            'ambition coalition” of developed and developing countries that '
            'ensured the 1.5C limit was included in the 2015 Paris climate '
            'agreement, reinforcing calls for big emitters to do more to cut '
            'carbon this decade. Biden added, however, that he did not seek '
            'conflict with China and indicated he could take a softer stance '
            'if China stepped up with more measures on the climate. “This is '
            'competition, not conflict,” he said. “[Tackling the climate '
            'crisis] is an economic opportunity.” Biden’s words at his final '
            'press conference reflect a hardening stance towards China more '
            'generally at the talks, from developed countries who want the '
            'world’s second biggest economy to go further, especially on '
            'phasing out coal, and developing countries who fear the 1.5C goal '
            'will slip out of reach without action to halve emissions this '
            'decade. China’s head of delegation at Glasgow, the veteran '
            'official Xie Zhenhua, was also in a forthright mood earlier in '
            'the day, accusing developed countries of having failed the rest '
            'of the world, by failing to cut emissions fast enough and by '
            'failing to provide the developing world with $100bn a year in '
            'climate finance, which has long been promised, to help poor '
            'countries cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme '
            'weather. China does not receive climate finance but sees itself '
            'as a champion of developing country interests. He defended '
            'China’s use of coal, saying building a limited number of new '
            'plants was necessary to bridge the gap while China updated its '
            'energy grid for more renewables, adding that the new plants were '
            'highly efficient and replaced old, inefficient plants that were '
            'being decommissioned. But he said that he had spoken extensively '
            'to John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, and to the UK’s Alok '
            'Sharma, who is president of the talks. He said those '
            'conversations had been “highly constructive”. Jean Su, energy '
            'justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: '
            '“At Biden’s press conference we saw the whiplash of his rhetoric '
            'on climate in action. First he asks Opec to pump more oil, then '
            'describes his worry about the horrors of climate change. “To set '
            'his climate ambition straight, it would be profound and '
            'game-changing for him to return to Washington and declare a '
            'national climate emergency to halt crude oil exports. That’s just '
            'one of the tools Biden has to take transformative action on '
            'climate without Congress. Biden sounds just as worried as the '
            'rest of us, but he has power unlike anyone else’s. For the sake '
            'of us and the planet, he has to use it.” Boris Johnson, the UK '
            'prime minister, delivered an upbeat assessment of the prospects '
            'for a deal at the conference that would keep the 1.5C goal within '
            'reach, despite having warned at the weekend that the chances were '
            'slim.',

{'article': 'Make sense of it if you can. Yesterday morning the time was one '
            'minute to midnight and humanity was 5-1 down to climate change. '
            'Today the time must be at least 50 seconds to midnight and we '
            'have clawed back a goal. Or possibly two. Presumably the second '
            'one is still being checked by VAR. So the score is either 5-2 or '
            '5-3. Boris Johnson didn’t seem to know which as he prepared to '
            'leave Cop26 in Glasgow. Though he did think we were probably '
            'heading into extra time. At least that seemed to be the gist of '
            'what Johnson had to say, though it was hard to tell as he gives '
            'no sign of knowing how football works. In the clash of metaphors, '
            'the first casualty is clarity.\n'
            'There again it wasn’t entirely obvious why the prime minister had '
            'called a press conference in the first place as he didn’t really '
            'have anything much to say. The only logical conclusion was that '
            'he had got a bit carried away. He had clearly come to Glasgow '
            'expecting the conference to be a total disaster and was relieved '
            'to discover that it had all gone a bit better than he expected. '
            'Bertie Booster was now cautiously optimistic that world leaders '
            'would find enough they could agree on to make it look as if some '
            'progress had been made and he wanted to share his excitement with '
            'someone. Not that he wanted to raise hopes massively. But 122 '
            'nations had agreed to tackle deforestation, 90% of the world was '
            'committed to net zero, big strides forward had been made on '
            'methane and the developed countries were only going to be a '
            'little bit late in making good on an unambitious target of giving '
            '£100bn a year to developing countries. But that all had to be a '
            'good thing to have achieved in just two days, didn’t it? At which '
            'point Boris relapsed into his James Bond fantasies and started '
            'talking about possibly cutting the right wires to defuse the '
            'bomb. Understandably the media didn’t entirely share the prime '
            'minister’s optimism. Many of the reporters have been to rather '
            'more Cop summits than Boris and have a better idea of how these '
            'things work. They know the bottom line for many of the world '
            'leaders is to come up with a few eye-catching headlines at the '
            'beginning of the conference so they can then nip back home – '
            'after congratulating each other on how much they had done to save '
            'the planet.\n'
            'Whether anything changed was neither here nor there. It was all '
            'about the optics. For 48 hours or so the private world of the '
            'rich and powerful was played out in public. So we had Boris '
            'hailing prime minister Narendra Modi as a hero of climate change '
            'because he had committed India to net zero by 2070. Which was at '
            'least 20 years too late as the planet would have burned by then. '
            'Any idea of taking the game into extra time was for the birds '
            'with that sort of target. But Modi had to be praised. Because he '
            'would then in turn praise Boris. And everyone deferred to Jeff '
            'Bezos. Because the founder of Amazon had promised $2bn to save '
            'the Amazon. No matter that he could have easily doubled that '
            'level of funding without feeling the pinch. At Cop26, generosity '
            'is a relative term. But the organisers couldn’t have been more '
            'pleased to have him and his support. So no one dared question '
            'Jeff on the hypocrisy of his recent venture into space tourism. '
            'Jeff’s carbon footprint cannot be questioned because he’s got so '
            'much cash to give. Rather it’s indulged, as he went on to say how '
            'life-changing his 10-minute space flight had been. “Oh Mr Bezos, '
            'you’re so wonderful,” sobbed the compere. See me, feel me, touch '
            'me. And it was this “Lifestyle par Jeff” that Boris had fallen '
            'for and on which he got called out. How come no one was talking '
            'about China? Without the active engagement of the world’s biggest '
            'polluter everyone was wasting their time. This was like being 5-2 '
            'down seconds from the end of the game and playing without two of '
            'your star strikers. Johnson didn’t even pretend to have an '
            'answer. Things would just work out somehow because they always '
            'had in the past. Even if they hadn’t. The trick was to believe. '
            'The questions didn’t ease up. How could the world trust Brazil to '
            'keep its promises given Jair Bolsonaro’s track record of '
            'destroying the rainforest? Boris shrugged. He was sure the '
            'Brazilian president would keep his word this time and besides, '
            'people would stop buying goods sourced from Brazil if he didn’t. '
            'Dream on. Then reality bit. The developing countries were already '
            'saying that none of this was enough. They faced annihilation if '
            'global temperatures weren’t restricted to a 1.5C rise and even '
            'with the new agreements we were nowhere near that. And the '
            'developed world needed to stump up far more than the £100bn a '
            'year that it was already not providing.\n'
            '“Look, I don’t want to sugar-coat this,” said Bertie Booster. But '
            'he did. As that’s what he always does. He can’t cope with too '
            'much reality. Just like so many others at Cop26, it’s the '
            'illusion of having made a difference that counts. With that, '
            'Boris left to go home. He did feel a bit guilty about the private '
            'jet, but it was a lot smaller than some other world leaders’ '
            'planes, and he could always plant a tree in Downing Street. That '

            'reportedly set to join Cardiff in the summer, has not played this '
            'season and only linked up with the Wales squad on Monday.\n'
            'There was some positive injury news for Pivac on Tuesday, with '

            'South Africa coach, Jacques Nienaber, has made four changes to '
            'the team that defeated the All Blacks in their most recent match, '
            'two of them forced by injury and unavailability. Damian Willemse '
            'will make his fourth start at full-back in place of a rested '
            'Willie Le Roux in a move Nienaber described as “a little side '
            'project”. Jesse Kriel takes over on the wing from Sbu Nkosi, who '
            'is stranded in South Africa awaiting his visa, while Herschel '
            'Jantjies starts at scrum-half in place of the injured Faf de '
            'Klerk. “Damian and Herschel have featured off the bench a fair '
            'bit and this is an opportunity to give them a chance to start as '
            'we look to build our squad depth ahead of the 2023 Rugby World '
            'Cup,” Nienaber said. “If we had to play a World Cup final on the '
            'weekend, we would probably select Willie because of his '
            'experience.\n'
            '“But this is an ideal situation to allow Damian to settle himself '
            'into the full-back position. It’s a little side project. We '
            'always want to win but we want to develop and transform and this '
            'is an ideal opportunity for us to get some experience into guys '
            'on this end-of-year tour.” The Springboks are also without the '
            'winger Cheslin Kolbe and the world player of the year, '
            'Pieter-Steph du Toit, due to injury for their British tour, which '
            'also features matches against Scotland and England. Nienaber is '
            'expecting a much-changed Wales team as his side go in search of a '
            'first win at the Principality Stadium for eight years. “Wales is '
            'going to be a nice challenge for us, especially if you look at '
            'our record here in Cardiff,” he said. “Because they are physical, '

{'article': 'Two struggling councils have been warned they face government '
            'intervention unless they selloff publicly-owned assets, including '
            'town halls, public toilets, leisure centres and libraries, and '
            'push ahead with further cuts to services. The threat by local '
            'government minister, Kemi Badenoch, followed publication of '
            'reviews into the two councils’ finances which concluded both ran '
            'the risk of failing to balance their budget – effectively going '
            'bankrupt – without urgent action. Badenoch told Peterborough city '
            'council, which is run by the Conservatives in alliance with '
            'independents, and Wirral council – run by a minority Labour '
            'administration – they must set out plans within 30 days to '
            'balance the books or face possible intervention. “Any faltering '
            'in this area would be of considerable concern and could lead to a '
            'reconsideration as to whether a different approach might be '
            'appropriate to secure the improvements that are necessary,” she '
            'wrote. The National Audit Office said this year that at least 25 '
            'councils in England were on the edge of bankruptcy after years of '
            'cuts, and amid soaring cost pressures. The pandemic has added '
            'more issues and both Slough and Croydon councils have declared '
            'effective bankruptcy in recent months. Peterborough – whose '
            'leader warned that “difficult choices” lay ahead – was told by '
            'Badenoch it had still not “fully grasped” the scale of its '
            'financial challenges, while in a separate letter she told Wirral '
            'it “had not fully acknowledged or perhaps even understood the '
            'severity” of its position. Both councils have made tens of '
            'millions of pounds of cuts in recent years, despite rising demand '
            'for services, particularly in adult social care and children’s '
            'services. Both have applied to government for financial support '
            'in recent months after concerns they would not be able to balance '
            'their budgets. The review of Peterborough’s finances said it had '
            'lost nearly £100m in government funding over the past decade. The '
            'council told reviewers services were now at “dangerously low '
            'levels” after repeated cuts in recent years and had in some cases '
            'reached a basic legal minimum service. However, the reviews '
            'insisted both councils had scope to make further cuts to services '
            'and should embark on a sale of assets. In Peterborough’s case '
            'this should include the sale of 3,000 acres of farmland, which '
            'currently bring in rent of £400,000 a year, the council town '
            'hall, and several office blocks. The review of Wirral’s finances '
            'concluded that it should sell off a raft of council-owned assets '
            'including golf courses, youth clubs, libraries, leisure centres, '
            'community centres, public toilets and office buildings to raise '
            'cash to balance its budget. The review criticised Wirral '
            'council’s apparent reluctance to make cuts or sack staff, saying '
            'it had a culture of avoiding “difficult financial decisions”. It '
            'said: “Until members and officers face up to the need to have to '
            'make difficult decisions … its financial sustainability remains '
            'uncertain.” Wayne Fitzgerald, the leader of Peterborough council, '
            'said: “The report acknowledges the very significant challenges we '
            'have faced in the past but also recognises that Peterborough’s '
            'services perform well and are low cost.” He added: “It is clear '
            'though that I as leader, including all other members, regardless '
            'of political party, must take on board the seriousness of these '
            'reports and set about implementing some of the recommendations '
            'which will mean that very difficult choices are ahead. “Going '
            'forward I want to invest more in services for residents and see '
            'the city continue to prosper and grow, but we will need the '
            'finances to do so.” Paul Satoor, chief executive of Wirral '
            'council, said: “We will take time to fully digest the findings '
            'and recommendations made in these reviews.”',

{'article': 'In the run-up to the Glasgow summit, Prince Charles generated '
            'headlines when he urged Scott Morrison to attend Cop26. The '
            'Prince of Wales argued that the conference could be the last '
            'chance to save the planet. At that time, Australia’s prime '
            'minister was yet to land his net zero deal with the Nationals, '
            'and was equivocating about whether or not he would fly to '
            'Glasgow. In a televised interview, the Prince of Wales warned of '
            'a “catastrophic” impact if leaders didn’t turn up and ambitious '
            'commitments weren’t landed. When a BBC interviewer told the '
            'prince Morrison had not officially confirmed his attendance, '
            'Australia’s future monarch said he was aware he would be accused '
            'of meddling but action was needed immediately.\n'
            '“You gently try to suggest there may be other ways of doing '
            'things, in my case,” he said. Otherwise, you lot accuse me of '
            'interfering and meddling, don’t you?” When asked why it was '
            'important a world leader like Morrison attend, he said: “Well, '
            'that’s what I’m trying to say all the time, and the point being '
            'that this is a last-chance saloon, literally. “Because if we '
            'don’t really take the decisions that are vital now, it’s going to '
            'be almost impossible to catch up.”\n'
            'Given that preamble, there was considerable interest in how '
            'things might go when the prime minister met the Prince of Wales '
            'at the summit. When the prince was ushered into the room on '
            'Tuesday, Morrison introduced him to George Brandis – the '
            'Australian high commissioner in London. For context, Morrison '
            'noted that he had known Brandis when they served together in the '
            'cabinet; the high commissioner was the attorney general in his '
            'past parliamentary life. Charles seemed intrigued. While small '
            'talk is generally the established protocol for these royal photo '
            'opportunities, Morrison was clearly anxious to get down to '
            'business. He spoke like a man on the clock. The prime minister is '
            'the marketing guy, and there was a pitch to deliver. “But now we '
            'are committed to net zero by 2050,” he told the prince, with no '
            'segue apparent between Brandis’s past lawmaking and carbon '
            'neutrality. “Australia has done that here at Cop26, doubled our '
            'climate finance commitments, and we are working very closely with '
            'our Pacific family.” The words got faster. Morrison noted Prince '
            'Charles had always given “great attention” to the Pacific. The '
            'prime minister’s body language suggested the Australian was '
            'hoping for approval. The prince was polite but didn’t gush. At '
            'one point, he looked at official photographers, or perhaps an '
            'adviser, with an expression best characterised as bemusement. He '
            'murmured assent about his well-established Pacific watching, '
            'scratched his nose absently, and waved Morrison in the direction '
            'of a chair. The show was over. The observers were ushered out.',

{'article': 'Virginians on Tuesday headed to the polls to elect a new '
            'governor, in a closely contested race between the Democrat Terry '
            'McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin widely seen as a '
            'referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency.\n'
            'They did so as a leading Virginia polling expert warned that '
            'Youngkin may be riding a wave of “white backlash” all the way to '
            'the governor’s mansion, having successfully focused on '
            'controversy over the place of race in education. In the final '
            'hours of the campaign, the candidates offered starkly different '
            'closing arguments, making their cases to voters whose odd-year '
            'gubernatorial elections have long reflected the national '
            'political mood a year into any new administration. Saddled by '
            'Biden’s sagging poll numbers and intra-party wrangling that has '
            'gridlocked the president’s domestic spending agenda, McAuliffe '
            'has attempted to tether his opponent to Donald Trump, a '
            'polarizing figure in voter-rich northern suburbs. Youngkin has '
            'mostly avoided the subject of Trump while embracing many of his '
            'tactics, a strategy many Republican strategists believe could be '
            'a model for the midterm elections next year. Polls showed an '
            'unexpectedly close race in a state that has trended Democratic '
            'since the election of Barack Obama in 2008. A loss in Virginia, '
            'which Biden won by nearly 10 points in 2020, would be deeply '
            'alarming for a party already bracing for a difficult challenge '
            'next year. Hours before polls closed in the commonwealth, Biden '
            'expressed confidence that Democrats would win the gubernatorial '
            'race in Virginia, and hold the governor’s mansion in New Jersey, '
            'where the incumbent, Phil Murphy, is seeking re-election in the '
            'Garden state. “We’re gonna win,” Biden said, leaning into the '
            'microphone for emphasis, during a press conference in Glasgow, '
            'Scotland. He acknowledged that the contest in Virginia was '
            '“tight”, saying the outcome would reflect “who shows up, who '
            'turns out”. But he waved off attempts to read the race as a '
            'barometer of his presidency, insisting that McAuliffe’s fortunes '
            'in the state were not tied to his poll numbers or his domestic '
            'agenda. “Even if we had passed my agenda, I wouldn’t claim we won '
            'because Biden’s agenda passed,” he told reporters. The president '
            'predicted that Americans would know the result by the time Air '
            'Force One touches down in Washington at roughly 1am local time, '
            'though some analysts have warned that it could take longer. '
            'Changes to Virginia law mean mail-in and early ballots will be '
            'tabulated more quickly than in 2020. As such, Democrats may '
            'appear to be ahead early in the night, before the localities more '
            'favorable to Republicans start counting election day ballots. On '
            'Monday, the last day of dueling events, McAuliffe continued to '
            'hammer Youngkin over his connections to Trump, warning darkly '
            'that a Republican win in Virginia could help pave the way for a '
            'Trump comeback in 2024. But then he went further. “Guess how '
            'Glenn Youngkin is finishing his campaign?” the former governor, '
            '64, told a crowd in Fairfax. “He is doing an event with Donald '
            'Trump here in Virginia.” That was a lie. Trump was not in '
            'Virginia, though he did boost the Republican candidate with a '
            'tele-rally. Youngkin did not participate.\n'
            'Youngkin, 54, a former private equity executive and political '
            'newcomer, closed his campaign with a final attempt to harness '
            'parents’ anger over school closures, mask mandates and what their '
            'children are learning, and turn it into an election night upset. '
            'Asked why education had become a central factor in Youngkin’s '
            'stronger-than-expected showing, Larry Sabato of the Center for '
            'Politics at the University of Virginia said: “One of the '
            'candidates decided it was his ticket to the governor’s mansion '
            'and he may well be right.” Speaking to MSNBC, Sabato pointed to '
            'the core of Youngkin’s appeal on education: a promise to ban '
            'critical race theory in schools. Critical race theory, or CRT, is '
            'an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism '
            'operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Virginia '
            'schools, regardless of Youngkin’s promise to ban it. “The '
            'operative word is not critical,” Sabato said. “And it’s not '
            'theory. It’s race. What a shock, huh? Race. That is what matters. '
            'And that’s why it’s sticks. “There’s a lot of, we can call it '
            'white backlash, white resistance, whatever you want to call it. '
            'It has to do with race. And so we live in a post-factual era … It '
            'doesn’t matter that [CRT] isn’t taught in Virginia schools. It’s '
            'this generalised attitude that whites are being put upon and '
            'we’ve got to do something about it. We being white voters.” '
            'Cultural issues have dominated the race, Youngkin also promising '
            'to give parents more control over how public schools handle '
            'gender and Covid-19, McAuliffe vowing to protect voting rights '
            'and abortion access. McAuliffe, a Clinton ally who was governor '
            'of Virginia from 2014 to 2018 – the state does not allow '
            'consecutive terms – has seen his lead evaporate. Polls have shown '
            'Youngkin succeeding by appealing to independents turned off by '
            'Trump without alienating his ardent supporters. Youngkin '
            'campaigned as an advocate for parents who want more say in their '
            'children’s education, capitalising on anger among conservatives '
            'who believe schools are overreaching in the name of diversity. '
            'Speaking in Richmond on Monday, he promised he would usher in “a '
            'Virginia where our government stops telling us what to do all the '
            'time”. McAuliffe also handed Youngkin a political gift when he '
            'said in a debate in September: “I don’t think parents should be '
            'telling schools what they should teach.” He has attacked Youngkin '
            'for hesitating to say whether Biden won the presidency '
            'legitimately. Youngkin acknowledged Biden’s victory but also '
            'called for an audit of Virginia voting machines, prompting '
            'Democrats to accuse him of validating Trump’s baseless election '
            'conspiracy theories.\n'
            'Both Biden and Barack Obama campaigned for McAuliffe. Trump has '
            'not visited the state. In his tele-rally on Monday, the former '
            'president told voters Youngkin would protect suburbs and did not '
            'repeat his lies about voter fraud. McAuliffe responded on '
            'Twitter, saying Trump was “pulling out all the stops to win this '
            'race because he knows Glenn will advance his Maga agenda here in '
            'Virginia. Tomorrow, Virginia will choose a better way.” In their '
            'final word on the campaign, Sabato’s team at UVA moved their '
            'prediction from “leans Democratic” to “leans Republican”. “Our '
            'sense is that the race has been moving toward Youngkin,” Kyle '
            'Kondik and J Miles Coleman wrote, “in large part because of the '
            'political environment. McAuliffe’s Trump-centric campaign also '
            'just doesn’t seem as potent in a non-federal race with the former '
            'president no longer in the White House.”',

{'article': 'Last week’s budget included a stealth cut to funding for youth '
            'services worth more than £400m over the next three years, Labour '
            'has claimed. In his budget speech last Wednesday, Rishi Sunak '

            'enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs across the country.” '
            'However, the Conservatives had already promised a £500m Youth '
            'Investment Fund in 2019; and the National Citizen Service, which '
            'provides young people with volunteering opportunities, has '

            'public spending on services for young people in England has been '

            'anti-social behaviour alongside the huge challenge of violent '
            'crime and county lines. Youth services prevent serious youth '
            'violence that costs taxpayers and ruins young people’s lives.” '
            '“Given how much has been stripped away from youth services over '
            'the last decade by the Conservatives, this disguised cut from the '
            'government is likely to force many grassroots youth organisations '
            'to close.” As MPs continued to debate the budget in the House of '
            'Commons on Wednesday, Labour MPs accused Sunak of failing to make '
            'up for more than a decade of austerity – comparing his promise of '
            'new “family hubs,” to the more than 500 Sure Start centres '
            'scrapped since 2010, for example. A spokesperson for the '
            'Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport conceded that '
            'the £560m promised by Sunak would include the cost of running the '
            'pre-existing NCS, which was set up by David Cameron. “We are '
            'determined to give every child the best start in life and level '
            'up opportunity across the country,” they said. “Last week we '
            'announced plans to invest £560m to make sure youth services get '
            'the support they need. This includes funding the construction or '
            'refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived '
            'areas of the country, and supporting the running of the NCS over '
            'the next three years.” The spokesperson also pointed to almost '
            '£5bn set aside for helping school pupils catch up with lost '
            'learning in the wake of the pandemic – though that is '
            'significantly less than was recommended by the government’s own '
            'adviser on the issue, , who quit in protest. Sunak’s third budget '
            'included a slew of spending promises, as the Conservatives seek '
            'to live up to their promise to “level up” neglected parts of the '
            'UK; but he also held out the prospect of tax cuts in the run-up '
            'to the next election.',

{'article': 'Eddie Jones has mounting injury headaches before England’s '
            'opening autumn international against Tonga on Saturday with '
            'Marcus Smith a doubt to face the Pacific Islanders, potentially '
            'disrupting the head coach’s plans to unleash a new-look 10-12 '
            'axis. Compounding matters for Jones is a report that the '
            'scrum-half Harry Randall, who has been ruled out of the entire '
            'autumn series, was injured during a paddleboarding session as '
            'part of a team-bonding exercise in Jersey last week. In addition, '
            'Max Malins, Louis Lynagh and Raffi Quirke will all miss the match '
            'at Twickenham with injuries sustained before coming into camp.\n'
            'Smith has been severely restricted in training this week due to a '
            'lower leg injury and faces a race against time to prove his '
            'fitness before Jones names his starting XV to face Tonga on '
            'Thursday. Jones remains “cautiously optimistic” Smith will be fit '
            'to play some part in the match but having already revealed his '
            'intention to pair the in-form fly-half with his captain, Owen '
            'Farrell, in a revamped midfield, the head coach could be forced '
            'into a rethink. Jones also has problems at full-back with doubts '
            'lingering over Freddie Steward, who also has a lower leg injury, '
            'and as a result George Furbank has been retained in Jones’s '
            'truncated squad. Scrum-half is a problem position, too. The RFU '
            'has insisted that Randall was cleared to train after the '
            'paddleboarding session and his hip injury was diagnosed after a '
            'subsequent rugby session but his absence, and that of Quirke, '
            'leaves Jones light in that department. If Smith is ruled out, '
            'meanwhile, Farrell would switch to fly-half with Manu Tuilagi and '
            'Henry Slade the likely centre pairing, though the uncapped Mark '
            'Atkinson has also been retained.\n'
            '“[Marcus] hasn’t done much this week, just a bit of ball '
            'handling,” Jones said. “We’re being conservative with him but '
            'we’re cautiously optimistic that he’ll be right to play. The last '
            'call we make is 48 hours before the game. “We are keen for '
            '[Marcus] to be involved in the game. It’s not frustrating, it’s '
            'part and parcel of preparing a team, players pick up small '
            'knocks, and he’ll recover well. If we don’t get to see him this '
            'week we will get to see him next week.” Malins and Quirke were '
            'named in the 28-man squad on Tuesday night but neither is in '
            'contention to face Tonga, meaning Northampton’s scrum-half Alex '
            'Mitchell is set for the matchday 23 with Randall also absent. '
            'There was no place, however, for Sam Simmonds, who waits for '
            'another England cap having last appeared under Jones in 2018. The '
            'Saracens hooker Jamie George has been kept on, having been '
            'initially left out of the squad, while Alex Dombrandt, Adam '
            'Radwan and Jamie Blamire are all set to add to the caps they won '
            'over the summer.\n'
            'Meanwhile, Alun Wyn Jones has been ruled out for the rest of the '

            'injury sustained in the defeat against the All Blacks on '
            'Saturday. Jones, who was winning his record 149th cap for Wales, '

{'article': 'The team behind the musical Into the Woods says the show will go '
            'on despite a production at the Old Vic in London being cancelled '
            'after staff unrest at director Terry Gilliam’s involvement. The '
            'Old Vic is yet to give an explicit reason for the cancellation of '
            'Stephen Sondheim’s 1986 play, but it is understood staff at the '
            'theatre were unhappy about previous remarks made by Gilliam about '
            'the #MeToo movement, diversity and trans rights. Former artistic '
            'director of the English National Opera John Berry, whose '
            'production company Scenario Two is co-producing the show, said: '
            '“We are focusing on finding a new home for this show … These '
            'things happen, it’s not the first change of plan for a West End '
            'show, or the last, and current times everywhere are '
            'unpredictable.” Scenario Two, Berry added, retains the rights for '
            'Into The Woods with Gilliam directing. Last week, the Old Vic '
            'posted a brief statement on its website announcing that it and '
            'Scenario Two had “mutually agreed” that Into the Woods would no '
            'longer take place at the Old Vic. “The Old Vic wishes the show '
            'well for its future life,” the statement said, adding that ticket '
            'holders would be contacted directly. Although it was a surprise '
            'last-minute cancellation of a show scheduled for spring 2022, a '
            'report by the Stage – independently confirmed by the Guardian – '
            'revealed it followed a protracted row that began when the '
            'production was announced last May. At an all-staff meeting at the '
            'time, Old Vic executive director Kate Varah allegedly addressed '
            'concerns raised by staff who felt Gilliam’s previous comments '
            'were at odds with the Old Vic’s culture and values. This included '
            'members of the Old Vic 12, the organisation’s artistic '
            'development scheme made up of young writers, producers and '
            'directors. It is understood that Varah also met with Gilliam and '
            'co-director Leah Hausman to discuss these values. The Old Vic has '
            'not confirmed this meeting to the Guardian, but in a statement to '
            'the Stage it said: “Ahead of any season announcement, senior '
            'management at the Old Vic would meet with the directors who are '
            'programmed to work in the season as a matter of course to discuss '
            'our culture and values. This happened with the co-directors of '
            'Into the Woods, Terry Gilliam and Leah Hausman.” The '
            'organisation’s decision to part ways with Into the Woods came '
            'soon after Gilliam posted in support of Dave Chappelle’s new '
            'comedy show on Netflix, which has been criticised as transphobic. '
            '“I’m encouraging all of you to watch Dave Chappelle’s new show … '
            'To me, he’s the greatest standup comedian alive today: incredibly '
            'intelligent, socially aware, dangerously provocative, and '
            'gut-wrenchingly funny,” he wrote. The former Monty Python star '
            'has previously courted controversy by describing the #MeToo '
            'movement as a “witch-hunt”. In the same interview, he said he was '
            '“tired of white men being blamed for everything wrong with the '
            'world,” adding: “When I announce that I’m a black lesbian in '
            'transition, people take offence at that. Why?” In 2017 the Old '
            'Vic received 20 allegations of inappropriate behaviour by staff '
            'members against the theatre’s former artistic director Kevin '
            'Spacey. Into the Woods, which has played on Broadway and the West '
            'End, is inspired by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. The '
            'Stage reported that Sondheim, the composer, approved the new '
            'production because he was impressed with Gilliam’s treatment for '
            'the show. While critics said Gilliam had been unfairly '
            '“cancelled”, others – including some members of the Old Vic 12 – '
            'welcomed the move. “This should have been scrapped over a year '
            'ago, but it’s taken them this long to do something right for '
            'ONCE,” Nassy Konan wrote on Twitter. Penny Babakhani tweeted: “It '
            'should have been cancelled over a year ago. And the leadership at '
            'the Old Vic who owe many of us an apology for the awful, awful '
            'way this was handled.” The Old Vic did not respond to an approach '
            'for comment. Gilliam has not yet responded.',

            'light in the organisation after it was banned by the UK '
            'government, a jury has been told. Ben Raymond, 32, from Swindon '
            'in Wiltshire, was one of the founders of NA, whose members '
            'hoarded machetes, swords, ice picks, firearms and even a crossbow '
            'powerful enough to bring down an elephant, Bristol crown court '

            'Raymond allegedly acted as a “roving ambassador” for the group, '
            'which is said to have had links with far-right groups in eastern '
            'Europe, Norway and the US and was formed with the aim of '

            'he attacked an Asian dentist in a supermarket in north Wales with '
            'a machete. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said Raymond was a '
            '“public face” of NA and was careful not to stockpile weapons '
            'himself or carry out physical attacks. “His jihad was fought with '
            'words and images,” said Jameson. “He was, like Joseph Goebbels of '

            'cleansing agenda to the media with sometimes transcendental '
            'calm.” Founded in 2013 when Raymond was a student, NA was, '
            'Jameson said, “racist, antisemitic and aggressive”, a “white '
            'jihadist” group the like of which had not been seen in the UK '
            'since the British Union of Fascists, which was banned in 1940. '
            'The group was small, secretive and paranoid, the jury was told, '
            'communicating using cryptic messaging systems, some of which '
            'self-destructed, and organised paramilitary training such as '
            'mixed martial arts and fighting with knives. NA was banned in '
            'December 2016, the court heard, the first far-right group to be '
            'proscribed since the second world war, joining organisations such '
            'as the IRA and al-Qaida.\n'
            'But Jameson said Raymond and others flouted the ban with NA '
            '“morphing” into cells that continued to operate underground. '
            'After the ban another leader emailed fellow members: “We are '
            'shedding one skin for another … These are exciting times.” Groups '
            'that emerged after the ban included the TripleK Mafia, which was '
            'based in the Midlands, one in the north-west called Revenge, and '
            'Scottish Dawn, the court was told. Raymond used his artistic '

{'article': 'A senior member of the UK government’s pandemic advisory body has '

            '“concerning”. Sir Jeremy Farrar, who has been a part of the '

            'of the pandemic left the group at the end of October, Sky News '
            'has reported. The director of the charitable Wellcome Trust had '
            'pushed for more mask wearing, use of ventilation and greater '
            'Covid testing to try to tackle rising cases, in a plan which has '
            'been termed “vaccine plus”. However the government has stuck to '
            'its current strategy of trying to encourage people to get '
            'vaccinated and for those eligible to take up booster jabs. Farrar '
            'revealed in a book published earlier this year, Spike: The Virus '
            'v The People, that he almost resigned in September 2020 when '
            'cases were rising and the government had just finished its “eat '
            'out to help out” scheme to try to drive people back into '
            'hospitality venues. He had also been among those to call for a '
            'lockdown in mid-March 2020, as Covid infections increased and '
            'other countries like Italy and France saw large numbers of people '
            'in hospital with the virus\n'
            'In a statement, he said Sage had come under huge pressure during '
            'the pandemic, and that he was leaving to devote more time to the '
            'Wellcome Trust. He said: “The Covid-19 crisis is a long way from '
            'over, with the global situation deeply troubling. “The high '
            'levels of transmission seen in the UK remain concerning, but I '
            'stepped down as a participant of Sage knowing ministers had been '
            'provided with most of the key science advice needed over the '
            'winter months. “Throughout this crisis Sage has provided vital '
            'evidence, and independent, expert, transparent advice to support '
            'the UK response, often under huge pressure.” He added: “My focus '
            'now must be on our work at Wellcome. This includes supporting the '
            'international research effort to end the pandemic, ensuring the '
            'world is better prepared for inevitable future infectious disease '
            'threats, and making the case so the full potential of science is '
            'realised to inform and drive change against all the urgent health '
            'threats we face globally.” The government updated public '
            'documents detailing Sage’s membership on Tuesday, but Sir '
            'Jeremy’s name remained on it. A government spokesperson said: '
            '“Throughout the pandemic we have been guided by scientific and '
            'medical experts and thanks to our collective national effort we '
            'have saved lives, vaccinated tens of millions of people and '
            'protected our NHS. “We knew the coming months would be '
            'challenging – this is exactly why we set out our Covid plan for '
            'autumn and winter. We are monitoring all the data closely, and '
            'the prime minister has been clear that it does not yet show that '
            'Plan B [such as compulsory face masks in some settings, asking '

            'in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the '
            'NHS. “Our focus remains on our booster campaign, vaccinating 12- '
            'to 15-year-olds, and encouraging those who haven’t yet come '
            'forward to have their jab.”',

            'permanent successor to José Mourinho.\n'
            'Conte has been a promised a degree of control over transfer '
            'business, alongside Fabio Paratici, the managing director of '
            'football, with whom he had a successful spell at Juventus from '
            '2011-14. Levy has assured Conte that he will always back him for '
            'the right player. Sales will, however, remain vital to the size '
            'of the budget. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and '
            'to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a '
            'protagonist again,” said Conte, who won Serie A with '
            'Internazionale last season. “Tottenham Hotspur has '
            'state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the '
            'world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and '
            'the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have '
            'always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach.\n'
            '“Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my '
            'relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too '
            'involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet '
            'the right time to return to coaching. But the contagious '
            'enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust '
            'me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the '
            'opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great '
            'conviction.” Conte met the players and observed training on '
            'Tuesday afternoon in preparation for Thursday’s Europa Conference '
            'League game at home to Vitesse. The club fully expect his work '
            'permit to have come through in time for him to take the team at '
            'that match. On Sunday Spurs travel to Everton in the Premier '
            'League, in which they are ninth after five defeats in their '
            'opening 10 games.\n'
            'Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. '
            'His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and '
            'trophies in both Italy and England. I know first-hand the '
            'qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at '

{'article': 'Facebook will delete the “faceprints” of more than a billion '
            'people after announcing that it is shutting down its facial '
            'recognition system due to the “many concerns” about using the '
            'technology. The social media network has been under political, '
            'legal and regulatory pressure over its use of the software, which '
            'automatically identifies users in photos and videos – and let’s '
            'them know if a fellow user has posted a photo or video with them '
            'in it – if they have opted in to the feature. In a statement, '
            'Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said it would shut down facial '
            'recognition on the platform over the coming weeks and delete 1 '
            'billion facial recognition templates. Meta’s vice-president of '
            'artificial intelligence, Jerome Pesenti, said the technology had '
            'helped visually impaired and blind users identify their friends '
            'in images and can help prevent fraud and impersonation. But '
            'Pesenti said the advantages needed to be weighed against “growing '
            'concerns about the use of this technology as a whole”. “There are '
            'many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in '
            'society, and regulators are still in the process of providing a '
            'clear set of rules governing its use,” he said. “Amid this '
            'ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial '
            'recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.” If '
            'users have opted into the face recognition setting, the faceprint '
            'used to identify them will be deleted. If that face recognition '
            'setting is turned off, Meta said there is no faceprint to delete. '
            'Pesenti said Facebook will encourage users to tag posts manually. '
            'In 2020, Facebook’s parent company paid $650m (£477m) to settle a '
            'US class action lawsuit brought by users who claimed the firm had '
            'created and stored scans of their faces without permission. '
            'Complaints had also been filed with the US competition regulator '
            'and in 2012 a Facebook application to introduce facial '
            'recognition in the EU had to be withdrawn because no provision '
            'had been made to gain user consent. Pesenti added that the '
            'decision reflected a “company-wide” move away from facial '
            'recognition technology. Meta also owns the Instagram '
            'photo-sharing app and the WhatsApp messaging service, with 2.8 '
            'billion people using the company’s platforms, including 1.9 '
            'billion for Facebook. Last week the parent company rebranded '
            'itself from Facebook in recognition of a new focus on the '
            'metaverse, a concept where the physical and digital worlds '
            'combine to allow people to lead their professional and social '
            'lives virtually, via digital representation of themselves – or '
            'avatars. The rebranding and the facial recognition moves come as '
            'Meta has been rocked by a series of revelations from '
            'whistleblower Frances Haugen. The former employee has released '
            'tens of thousands of internal documents, and given testimonies to '
            'politicians in Westminster and Washington, which exposed Meta’s '
            'failure to keep some users safe and contain the spread of '
            'misinformation. In the wake of the Haugen revelations Meta has '
            'rowed back on one potential product launch by announcing that it '
            'has paused work on developing a version of Instagram for 10- to '
            '12-year-olds. It has also stressed that it will develop its '
            'metaverse plans in close cooperation with regulators and legal '
            'experts. Pesenti said that if the company intended to use facial '
            'recognition technology in the future it would “continue to be '
            'public about intended use” and “how people can have control over '
            'these systems and their personal data.”',

{'article': 'Good morning. France is furious over the growing scandal of a '
            'leaked text message from the French president to Scott Morrison, '
            'and world leaders continue to make pledges to fight the climate '
            'crisis at Cop26. French officials have vented their fury at the '
            'leaking of a text message from Emmanuel Macron to Morrison, as '
            'the prime minister faces accusations he has put his personal '
            'political interests ahead of healing the rift. “Confidence has '
            'been completely shattered,” a close adviser to Macron said, '
            'calling the release of the text “a pretty crude and '
            'unconventional tactic”. “It is not the kind of thing that is '
            'likely to improve relations between France and Australia,” the '
            'adviser said. The message, in which the French president asked '
            'Morrison whether to expect good or bad news on the submarine '
            'project, was shared to reinforce Australia’s position that France '
            'wasn’t blindsided about the cancellation of the $90bn submarine '
            'deal, but France argued it showed that Macron “did not know what '
            'stage the discussions had got to”. At the Cop26 summit today, US '
            'president Joe Biden has announced a pledge to cut global methane '
            'emissions by 30% by 2030. Reducing these emissions was touted as '
            'one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating '
            'ahead of the summit. World leaders agreed to coordinate the '
            'introduction of clean technologies in order to rapidly drive down '
            'their cost. African countries are preparing to spend at least '
            'US$6bn a year from their tax revenues adapting to the impacts of '
            'the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide '
            'US$2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet '
            'their goals. And Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has defended his '
            'trip to space, telling delegates that it made him realise how '

            'fossil fuel developments in the pipeline that could result in the '
            'equivalent of about 5% of global industrial emissions if all were '
            'to go ahead, an analysis says. The Australian government lists '
            '116 major coal and gas projects under development, and while not '
            'all will be built, a new report says it is an indication of the '
            'fossil fuel development that continues in Australia despite the '

{'article': 'Even a tactician as smart as Thomas Tuchel needs a bit of help '
            'sometimes. He does not have the solution to every structural '
            'issue and it helped that he was prepared to listen when his '
            'assistant, Arno Michels, laid out the plan that lifted a '
            'stuttering display from Chelsea, who were far more incisive after '
            'moving Hakim Ziyech to the left and sending Callum Hudson-Odoi to '
            'the right with instructions to break Malmo’s stubborn resistance '
            'by putting his speedy dribbling to good use. Michel’s ploy soon '
            'worked. The right-footed Hudson-Odoi had produced little on the '
            'left during the first half, slowing Chelsea’s momentum by cutting '
            'inside too much, but he was liberated after moving to the '
            'opposite flank. The winger was far too quick for Søren Rieks and '
            'Franz Brorsson on the left side of Malmö’s defence and he played '
            'a prominent role when the breakthrough arrived early in the '
            'second half, flying down the right wing and crossing for Ziyech '
            'to settle Chelsea’s nerves on a night when they were regularly '
            'pushed out of their comfort zone by limited but spirited '
            'opposition.\n'
            '“We got the job done,” Tuchel said. “I think maybe now we get '
            'judged by results, but who doesn’t? We needed the result, we '
            'expected the result, and we delivered. We had a lot of shots in '
            'the first half but it was not clinical enough. We wanted to '
            'increase the intensity level in the second half to force a goal. '
            'In the moment of the highest pressure we were able to use this '
            'moment with precision. It was a deserved win.” Ultimately one '
            'moment of class was enough for Chelsea, who remain hopeful of '
            'finishing top of Group H, although they will need to be sharper '
            'when they host Juventus later this month. This was a laboured '
            'performance from the European champions, who travelled to Sweden '
            'without N’Golo Kanté, Mateo Kovacic, Romelu Lukaku, Mason Mount '
            'and Timo Werner, and they were uncharacteristically slack at '
            'times. Malmö, beaten 4-0 at Stamford Bridge last month, put up a '
            'good fight. Chelsea, who have won their last seven games in all '
            'competitions, did not make life easy for themselves. They seemed '
            'surprised when Malmö pressed them during the early stages, a '
            'boisterous crowd roaring the Swedish champions forward, and '
            'Tuchel had reasons to be concerned as half-time approached. There '
            'was a carelessness to his team’s passing at times and there was '
            'even a chance for Malmö to go ahead after 11 minutes, a sloppy '
            'error from Ruben Loftus-Cheek forcing Andreas Christensen to mop '
            'up as Sebastian Nanasi threatened to break through on the left. '
            'Loftus-Cheek, who had not started in the Champions League since '
            '2015, was not the only player in blue who erred during an '
            'absorbing opening period. Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi made a complete '
            'mess of a short corner routine on the left and Malmö grew bolder '
            'as the half wore on, Antonio Colak going close to shocking '
            'Chelsea when he met Sergio Peña’s pass with a volley inches '
            'wide.\n'
            'Nonetheless there was always a sense that Chelsea’s quality would '
            'make the difference. Loftus-Cheek offered some classy touches in '
            'midfield after getting that early error out of his system and '
            'Malmö were clinging on at times, their defending increasingly '
            'frantic as the visitors began to dominate. Chelsea, who were '
            'pleased to see Christian Pulisic come off the bench to make his '
            'first appearance since August after shaking off a persistent '
            'ankle injury, should have led at the break. César Azpilicueta '
            'threatened from the edge of the area, Ziyech had a shot smothered '
            'after bursting through on goal and Kai Havertz was wasteful after '

{'article': 'No 10 is increasingly worried that hospitalisations and deaths '
            'among double-vaccinated people could rise due to waning immunity '
            'as an estimated 4.5 million people have failed to get their '
            'booster shots despite being eligible. Downing Street sources told '
            'the Guardian that the gap between those eligible and those jabbed '
            'was too wide, ranking it as their major concern ahead of the '
            'winter months. They acknowledged more needed to be done to '
            'encourage take-up as waning immunity meant more double jabbed '
            'people could get sick and were at greater risk of dying without '
            'the extra protection of the boosters. The UK reported 293 deaths '
            'with Covid on Tuesday – the highest level since February – '
            'although the figure included all NHS England deaths from Monday '
            'owing to reporting delays. There were 33,865 daily reported '
            'cases, a drop from more than 40,000 in recent days, and 9,538 '
            'people were in hospital with Covid on Monday compared with 6,467 '
            'a month ago. A record 1.6m boosters were delivered last week, '
            'with 7m in England since the programme started and hundreds of '
            'thousands of people booked in to receive jabs, according to NHS '
            'England. However, there are 11.5 million people eligible for '
            'their boosters, leaving a gap of 4.5 million. John Roberts, from '
            'the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, told the BBC on Tuesday '
            'expressed worries that not all those in priority groups will have '
            'had their third jabs before Christmas. Multiple studies suggest '
            'waning immunity from vaccines. Data from Israel, where 78% of '
            'people aged 12 and older are fully vaccinated, showed a large '
            'rise in infection rates over the summer. The UK-based Zoe Covid '
            'Study app, where users can log their jabs, test results and '
            'symptoms, has suggested protection against infection after two '
            'shots of Pfizer/BioNTech decreased from 88% at one month to 74% '
            'at five to six months, while protection against infection after '
            'two Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs fell from 77% to 67% at four to five '
            'months. Prof Tim Spector, the lead scientist on the study, said '
            'in August: “In my opinion, a reasonable worst-case scenario could '
            'see protection below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers '
            'by winter.” A Danish study suggested the under-65s had about 80% '
            'protection for at least six months, while the over-65s had only '
            '47% protection. The government is pinning its hopes of avoiding '
            'further restrictions over the winter on people taking up booster '
            'jabs, which are currently offered to over-50s and those with '
            'clinical vulnerabilities who had their second jab at least six '
            'months ago. Hundreds of walk-in clinics have opened up as part of '
            'an NHS campaign. Boris Johnson spoke about the need for people to '
            'realise the risks of not having their boosters over the weekend, '
            'saying it would be “tragic” if vulnerable people got seriously '
            'ill because they were “overconfident about their level of '
            'immunity and didn’t get their booster when they needed it”. “I '
            'think people don’t quite realise that the first two jabs do start '
            'to wane,” he said. Roberts, from the Institute and Faculty of '
            'Actuaries, said that he was concerned that the first priority '
            'groups will not all have received their Covid booster jabs by '
            'Christmas, warning that this could start to filter through into '
            'hospitalisation and death numbers in the next few days. “My worry '
            'is that, at the current rate, we’re still not going to complete '
            'the first priority groups one to nine until mid-January,” he told '
            'BBC Radio 4. “And that’s going to mean that there’s going to be a '
            'lot of mixing over Christmas with festive behaviour before and '
            'then on the day of people who haven’t got that extra protection '
            'from the booster, which really does make a huge difference. The '
            'analysis that we’re getting from Israel is that it will probably '
            'reduce deaths by 80 or 90% even. So it’s important that we get on '
            'with it as quickly as possible.” An NHS spokesperson said: “It is '
            'vital people come forward as quickly as possible – there are '
            'appointments available across the country and people can book in '
            'through the national booking service or use one of the hundreds '
            'of walk-in vaccination sites.”',

{'article': 'Yorkshire are facing the wrath of senior political figures over '
            'their handling of Azeem Rafiq’s allegations of racism at '
            'Headingley, with the club’s chair set to be questioned by the '
            'digital, culture, media and sport committee and Sajid Javid, the '
            'health secretary, calling for “heads to roll”. Javid, the son of '
            'Pakistani immigrants, was among a group of MPs incensed by a '
            'report on Monday from ESPNCricinfo that revealed the club’s '
            'investigation into the issue – previously published only as a '
            'summary of findings in September – had concluded the repeated use '
            'of the word “Paki” by a senior player, who is still at the club, '
            'towards Rafiq was “in the spirit of friendly banter”.\n'
            'On Tuesday Javid tweeted: “‘Paki’ is not banter. Heads should '
            'roll at Yorkshire CCC. If [the England and Wales Cricket Board] '
            'doesn’t take action it’s not fit for purpose.” Sayeeda Warsi, the '
            'peer and former Conservative party co-chair who hails from the '
            'county, added: “‘Paki’ is not banter. Too many of us in too many '
            'walks of life have heard the ‘defence of banter’ for too long as '
            'an excuse for racism. For years my business & others supported '
            '@YorkshireCCC – we need you to stop posturing & prevaricating & '
            'take responsibility for this.” Rafiq went public last year with '
            'allegations of the racism he experienced during two spells at the '
            'club between 2008 and 2018, with Yorkshire responding by '
            'launching an investigation headed by the law firm Squire Patton '
            'Boggs. A summary of the final report was released eight weeks '
            'ago, upholding seven of Rafiq’s 43 claims – including '
            'confirmation he was the “victim of racial harassment and '
            'bullying” – and led to an unreserved apology from the club. Among '
            'the findings came an admission from Yorkshire that it had failed '
            'to properly escalate Rafiq’s allegations when the former England '
            'Under-19s captain first raised them privately in 2018. But last '
            'week the club said it was “pleased” to announce that, after an '
            'internal review, no disciplinary action would be taken against '
            'any current player or staff member.\n'
            'After much prevarication, Yorkshire finally sent an unredacted '
            'copy of its report to the ECB last Thursday, with the governing '
            'body having now tasked its own regulatory and integrity teams '
            'with looking into the findings. On Tuesday, the ECB said: “We are '
            'conscious about the length of time that Azeem has waited for '
            'resolution and the toll that must be taking on his wellbeing and '
            'that of his family. We are sorry that, as a sport, this has not '
            'yet been resolved. “We will conduct a full regulatory process '
            'that is fair to all parties, but also ensure this happens as '
            'quickly as possible. To achieve this, we have secured the '
            'services of a QC, along with other external investigatory support '
            'to upweight resource around our process. The ECB Board has also '
            'reaffirmed its commitment to further additional resource, should '
            'the investigation require it.” As well as the ECB’s '
            'investigation, it was confirmed on Tuesday that Roger Hutton has '
            'been called to face questions from the DCMS committee, while '
            'senior management will also be invited to give evidence. Covered '
            'by parliamentary privilege, this could lead to more revelations '
            'entering the public domain. Julian Knight, MP for Solihull and '
            'the DCMS committee chair, said: “We are extremely concerned by '
            'recent reports about the lack of action against individuals '
            'following the findings. It’s clear that Yorkshire County Cricket '
            'Club has questions to answer.\n'
            '“We have monitored developments around the club’s handling of the '
            'serious allegations made by Azeem Rafiq. We want to see much '
            'greater transparency from YCCC – it is time for them to answer '
            'their critics. We intend to call the chair of the club before the '
            'DCMS committee to give a much fuller explanation than we have had '
            'so far.” Knight later tweeted: “Given the endemic racism at '
            'Yorkshire County Cricket Club, I struggle to think of any reason '
            'why the board should remain in post. This is one of the most '
            'repellent and disturbing episodes in modern cricket history.” '
            'Along with pressure from MPs and the ECB, Anchor butter, which '
            'had its logo on the first team’s shirt during this year’s Royal '
            'London Cup, confirmed the partnership would not be renewed. The '
            'company tweeted: “There is never a place or an excuse for racism. '
            'We have no further activity supporting YCCC.” Its logo was later '
            'removed from the YCCC website. The Emerald publishing group – one '
            'of Yorkshire’s primary sponsors, with naming rights at Headingley '
            '– has also said it will review the partnership following the '
            'conclusion of the ECB’s new investigation.',

{'article': 'Owen Paterson, the Conservative MP for North Shropshire and a '
            'former minister, is preparing to try to avoid a 30-day Commons '
            'suspension and possible byelection after the standards committee '
            'watchdog last week concluded he committed an “egregious” breach '
            'of lobbying rules. Ahead of a planned vote in parliament on '
            'Wednesday, here is a rundown of what he was accused of, the '
            'evidence and the potential repercussions: What rules did Paterson '
            'break? Paterson was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn’s '
            'Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards '
            'Agency (FSA) and Department for International Development '
            'ministers about the companies, the watchdog found. Three main '
            'wrongdoings were identified by the parliamentary standards '
            'commissioner, Kathryn Stone:\n'
            'First, breaching the part of the MPs’ code of conduct on paid '
            'advocacy. Paterson said he was acting as a whistleblower over '
            'milk safety but the commissioner said this was only true of the '
            'initial approach and first meeting. Thereafter, follow-up '
            'communications “were intended to benefit his clients rather than '
            'to raise a serious wrong”. Second, breaching the same code but '
            'the section that relates to using facilities and services funded '
            'by taxpayers. The commissioner found Paterson used his '
            'parliamentary office and meeting facilities in parliament 25 '
            'times for his work for paying clients, and that there were two '
            'letters sent on parliamentary paper. Third, Paterson failed to '
            'declare his interests in all communications with FSA staff. His '
            '“general approach” was to declare his interests, the commissioner '
            'said, but she added that under the rules an MP “must make a '
            'declaration in any communication when approaching a minister or '
            'official”. The combination of factors led to the commissioner '
            'saying Paterson’s breaches “were so serious and so numerous that '
            'they risked damaging public trust” in the House of Commons and in '
            'MPs generally. How are sanctions imposed on MPs when this '
            'happens? Usually, an investigation is launched by the standards '
            'commissioner, who investigates and then passes on their findings '
            'to the standards committee, which is made up of MPs – including '
            'four Conservatives – and other lay members. They scrutinise the '
            'evidence and initial findings and then make a final '
            'recommendation to parliament. The punishment is proposed as a '
            'government motion, and normally uncontested – MPs consent to the '
            'sanction “on the nod” without a formal division. However, '
            'Paterson has claimed the investigation was biased against him, '
            'was not consistent with “natural justice” and that it played a '
            'part in driving his wife, Rose Paterson, to kill herself last '
            'summer. Given there is no route of appeal, Paterson hopes to use '
            'the Commons – the final stage where the sanction can be stopped – '
            'as a forum to make his appeal. Why are the stakes so high? The '
            'Commons has never before reduced a suspension term, though it has '
            'increased them on very rare occasions since the second world war. '
            'MPs overruling the body set up to scrutinise their breach of the '
            'rules would risk undermining its independence, critics fear. '
            'Paterson feels strongly he has been denied a fair hearing because '
            'he had witnesses who wanted to give oral evidence but the '
            'standards commissioner said their written evidence sufficed. '
            'Paterson’s supporters feel he has little more to lose and is '
            'fighting to uphold his reputation and his seat in the House of '
            'Commons. This would be at risk if MPs vote to suspend him for '
            'more than 10 days, as it would trigger a recall petition. If 10% '
            'of his North Shropshire constituents were to sign it, there would '
            'be a byelection.',

{'article': 'Boris Johnson has declared he is “cautiously optimistic” about a '
            'deal at Cop26 to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C as he '
            'urged China to commit to bringing emissions down by 2025. The '
            'prime minister had previously said if the climate emergency were '
            'a football match the world would be 5-1 down but he said on '
            'Monday that the score was now more like 5-2 or 5-3. He claimed '
            'there had been a turnaround since the G20 leaders’ summit at the '
            'weekend, arguing that a commitment from Brazil on halting '
            'deforestation, the Indian pledge on decarbonising power by 2030 '
            'and extra cash promised by Japan were good signs.\n'
            'However, he said there was still a “very long way to go” before a '
            'deal to keep 1.5C alive was achieved. Experts have said that '
            'reductions of 28 gigatonnes of emissions by 2030 are necessary to '
            'meet that target but pledges so far do not add up to anywhere '
            'near that amount.\n'
            'Johnson said talks with China, the world’s biggest emitter, were '
            'now focused on trying to persuade its negotiators to bring '
            'forward its pledge for its emissions to peak in 2030 by five '
            'years. “You bet we need more progress from China … and everyone '
            'here at this gathering,” he told a press conference in Glasgow. '
            '“The question is how much before [2030]. That’s the issue. '
            'There’s a world of difference between peaking in 2030 … and '
            'peaking in 2025. That’s where we’re keeping the pressure up.” '
            'Johnson said another area of pressure was asking developed '
            'countries to contribute more in climate finance for developing '
            'countries, saying they are going to “have to do more”. UK '
            'government sources have acknowledged this is the most difficult '
            'area of negotiation and where Cop is likely to fall short. The '
            'prime minister said commitments from countries would be “100% '
            'useless if the promises are not followed up with action”. Asked '
            'about concern among voters about the cost of net zero, Johnson '
            'said people had to realise that failing to tackle the climate '
            'crisis would be an “economic catastrophe”. “I happen to think '
            'that there’s a great wisdom in the British people and I think '
            'that they can see that this is an issue that needs to be fixed '
            'and they may not listen to me, but they certainly listen to Sir '
            'David Attenborough and they look at what’s actually happening '
            'around the world,” he said. “They look at the fires, they look at '
            'the floods, and they look at the hurricanes, and the increased '
            'incidence of all three, much-increased incidence, and they think '
            'something’s happening here.” “They’re not dumb and they can see '
            'that this is something that needs to be tackled,” he added, while '
            'ruling out a referendum on the push for net zero. Johnson’s '
            'demeanour was more upbeat than at the G20 summit, when he warned '
            'of a serious risk of failure in Glasgow. His official '
            'spokesperson dismissed the idea that the prime minister had '
            'deliberately lowered expectations to later declare his '
            'negotiations with other world leaders in Glasgow a success. Asked '
            'whether Johnson’s weekend gloom had been expectation management, '
            'the spokesperson said: “The PM felt very much at the G20 that '
            'limited progress was made but was by no means the significant '
            'boost that was needed. What we’ve seen so far is some early signs '
            'that we are starting to make some progress. Again, we are not '
            'complacent. This is not a done deal by any means. There is a huge '
            'amount of work left to do.” Johnson has still not made a decision '
            'on whether to come back at the end of Cop26, and could instead '
            'make a statement from Downing Street on what is agreed.',

{'article': 'Among the 120 or so world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the '
            'Cop26 climate crisis talks, there has been one very conspicuous '
            'absence: Xi Jinping, president of by far the world’s largest '
            'greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for more than a quarter of '
            'all emissions. Mr Xi’s decision to stay away is unsurprising; '
            'previously a frequent traveller, he has not left his country for '
            '21 months, since the pandemic took hold. But the reduction of the '
            'Chinese leader’s contribution to a written statement, making no '
            'new commitments, has highlighted concern about Beijing’s recent '
            'decisions. The first is its announcement that it will build new '
            'coal-fired power plants, a response to extensive power cuts. '
            'Though experienced observers hope the medium-term impact will be '
            'less serious than it appears, it could imperil China’s pledge to '
            'peak carbon emissions in 2030. The second is its national plan on '
            'greenhouse gas emissions, revealed last Thursday. While better '
            'than the 2015 plan, it offers little progress on its already '
            'declared ambitions and falls well short of the action needed to '
            'ensure global heating does not exceed 1.5C. And in Glasgow, China '
            'has (like India and Russia) declined to sign up to the new '
            '80-country pact to cut methane emissions, although it has joined '
            'the agreement to halt deforestation over the next decade. Its '
            'failings are, of course, far from unique. China’s carbon '
            'emissions per capita are still around half those of the US, and '
            'its historical emissions are far lower (though it is catching up '
            'fast). Even now, its emissions reflect its role as the world’s '
            'factory. Unlike some wealthy countries, it has taken consistent '
            'climate action. The US has seesawed, with Donald Trump pulling '
            'out of the Paris accord, but even with Joe Biden’s renewed '
            'commitment to the issue it has a very long way to go. China made '
            'its key pledges in advance of Cop26, promising to peak emissions '
            'by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2060, increasing total wind and '
            'solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 to '
            'reach those goals. It has also pledged to end involvement in new '
            'coal-fired power stations overseas. Over recent years, it has '
            'gained a reputation (merited on renewables) for underpromising '
            'and overdelivering. And it has every reason to act. Devastating '
            'floods in Zhengzhou this summer will have added to long-term '
            'concerns about food security and the safety of prosperous, '
            'populous coastal cities. It has based its industrial strategy on '
            'the move to renewables, in terms of exports as well as a domestic '
            'shift. Its envoy Xie Zhenhua is a veteran of climate talks who '
            'has an established relationship with his US counterpart John '
            'Kerry and real clout at home – but not the authority to make new '
            'commitments without higher approval. China has also warned the US '
            'that cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment '
            'of difficult bilateral relations. Its security concerns '
            'strengthen its desire to hang on to coal, which it produces '
            'domestically. The US and the EU are reportedly looking past China '
            'to save their climate strategy, to countries including South '
            'Africa and Indonesia. The real issue is less that China came to '
            'Glasgow without a new commitment, but that it is better at '
            'unilateral declarations than multilateral engagement. Doing it '
            'all on its own terms makes the global progress needed far harder '
            'to achieve. At Cop26, China could have positioned itself as a '
            'world leader. (Instead, India – the world’s third-largest carbon '
            'emitter – is getting the applause, with Narendra Modi, the prime '
            'minister, setting a net zero emissions target of 2070 and '
            'significant shorter-term commitments.) Meeting the 1.5C target is '
            'crucial. China can and must do more. It should seek to do it hand '
            'in hand with other nations.',

{'article': 'Did the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, err in '
            'exaggerating the prospects of an interest rate rise? It seems so. '
            'Mr Bailey’s intervention, along with his chief economist’s, '
            'suggested the base rate might rise this week. City traders are '
            'now betting that it will do so – with the Bank’s rate-setting '
            'monetary policy committee (MPC) due to pronounce on Thursday. The '
            'governor is now damned if rates rise – giving the impression that '
            'the central bank can be talked into a hike. And he is damned if '
            'they do not – because he signalled rises that did not arrive. '
            'There is no pressing reason for money to be made dearer. For '
            'many, employment is far more precarious than the official figures '
            'suggest. Business surveys report more pessimism than optimism '
            'about the UK’s prospects. The chancellor did not help by '
            'precipitately withdrawing the fiscal stimulus. The budget ended '
            'the furlough scheme, reduced benefits and raised taxes, leaving – '
            'as the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed – wages stagnant for '
            'years to come. This, combined with higher interest rates and a '
            'bumpy path out of Covid, risks a recession, not a recovery. The '
            'economists David Blanchflower and Alex Bryson point out that, in '
            'the last MPC meeting in September, there was a 9-0 vote to keep '
            'rates at their current level of 0.1% as the “elevated global cost '
            'pressures will prove transitory”. Nothing has changed, say the '
            'academics, about that prudent judgment. One reason to raise rates '
            'would be to bring inflation to heel, but the economists say this '
            'is unnecessary. They compare Covid to a hurricane hitting an '
            'island. Once the storm recedes, everyone wants plumbers, roofers '
            'and electricians “whose wages rise dramatically for a while and '
            'inflation goes up temporarily. But eventually, after a few '
            'months, things get back to normal”. A rate hike would promote a '
            'needless deflationary shift of disposable income from poorer '
            'households that spend to richer ones that do not. In the past '
            'decade, the Bank has not used rates to cool asset (ie house) '
            'prices. There is little chance that it would now. There are '
            'reasons for a rate hike. One is to pay banks more to hold '
            'risk-free financial assets. A second is to put upward pressure on '
            'the currency, which would benefit City interests. A third is for '
            'the Bank to regain control of interest rates by tightening and '
            'then offering gilts to private investors rather than purchasing '
            'them itself. Raise rates for these reasons and the Bank might '
            'look captured by the financial interests that it is meant to '
            'oversee. Escaping the pandemic is proving more difficult than the '
            'easy getaway that was once imagined. Letting the Bank’s monetary '
            'policy – rather than Treasury spending – do the heavy lifting in '
            'these circumstances is far-fetched. The European Central Bank and '
            'the US Federal Reserve have blundered since 2010 by tightening '
            'too quickly out of a slowdown. Leaving rates unchanged seems the '
            'least bad option. Better to wait and see. The four external MPC '
            'members are unlikely to back a rate rise. The four undecided bank '
            'staff on the committee may do so to please the boss. Mr Bailey '
            'risks his credibility if this turns out to be a mistake that has '
            'to be reversed.',

{'article': 'The government’s independent vaccine advisers recommended against '
            'Covid shots for healthy teenagers despite considering evidence '
            'that the jabs would reduce infections, hospitalisations and some '
            'deaths in the age group. Modelling reviewed by the Joint '
            'Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in June showed '
            'that fully vaccinating 80% of 12- to 17-year-olds would lead to '
            '“large reductions” in infections and a “substantial reduction” in '
            'hospitalisations in the age group. The modelling from the '
            'University of Warwick was considered alongside calculations from '
            'Public Health England that found vaccinating healthy young people '
            'in an overlapping age group – those aged 15 to 19 – could reduce '
            'intensive care admissions and prevent two deaths per million in '
            'the teenagers receiving the shots. Details of the models, '
            'described in minutes from JCVI meetings held over the summer, '
            'have led some researchers to question why the committee did not '
            'approve mass vaccinations for healthy young teenagers, but '
            'instead passed the decision to the UK’s chief medical officers. '
            '“They had two models, one from Warwick and one from PHE, both '
            'showing significant benefits of vaccination,” said Prof Christina '
            'Pagel, the director of the clinical operational research unit at '
            'University College London (UCL) and a member of the Independent '
            'Sage group. But they appeared to have “dismissed it”, she said.\n'
            'The JCVI concluded that the benefits of vaccination were too '
            'marginal to justify in healthy 12- to 15-year-olds who rarely get '
            'severely ill with Covid. Explaining the decision, the committee '
            'cited uncertainties about a rare and typically mild side-effect '
            'called myocarditis, and concerns about the impact that a Covid '
            'vaccination programme could have on other school immunisations. '
            'The UK Health Security Agency said the modelling was “integral” '
            'to the committee’s decision. But Pagel believes the JCVI was more '
            'concerned than it should have been about the risks from the '
            'vaccine and underplayed the potential harm caused by the virus. '
            '“The JCVI consistently minimise the chance of bad outcomes of '
            'Covid in children as being very rare, but emphasise the rarer '
            'chance of developing myocarditis following vaccination,” she '
            'said. The UK’s chief medical officers later approved single shots '
            'of Covid vaccine for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds after '
            'considering the impact on children’s education. The delay in the '
            'decision meant that unlike those in some countries, secondary '
            'school children in the UK were largely unprotected when they '
            'returned to classes in the autumn term. At several points, the '
            'JCVI minutes state that natural infection might be better than '
            'vaccination for children. The criticisms of the JCVI came as '
            'members of Independent Sage and other researchers published work '
            'in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine suggesting that '
            'fully vaccinating healthy adolescents would reduce hospital '
            'admissions, deaths and cases of long Covid at the high case '
            'levels now seen in the UK. Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical '
            'microbiology at the University of Cambridge and a co-opted member '
            'of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats '
            'Advisory Group (Nervtag) said he shared some of the concerns '
            'raised about the JCVI. “Besides apparently ignoring the '
            'modelling, I’m worried about the lack of appreciation of the '
            'negative impacts of mass infection in children, such as long '
            'Covid and the risks of new variants emerging because of the low '
            'vaccine coverage in 12- to 15-year-olds. “Another issue from my '
            'point of view is the lack of internationally known and active '
            'researchers on the committee who know the virus. With better '
            'representation things would have been very different. The '
            'government needs to answer why this group was not radically '
            'modified for a Covid remit given the range of expertise '
            'available.” Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial '
            'College London, said: “Among the numerous contributory factors to '
            'the currently high caseload and deaths in the UK relative to '
            'mainland Europe, a significant one is certainly the impact of '
            'having delayed vaccines in secondary schools such that children '
            'returned unprotected for the autumn term.” In October, the '
            'British Congenital Cardiac Association said that with case rates '
            'very high among under-18s in England and Wales, the “balance of '
            'benefits versus risks clearly weighs in favour of the Covid-19 '
            'vaccine.”',

{'article': 'The Las Vegas Raiders released wide receiver Henry Ruggs III just '

            'felony charges after a car crash in the early hours of Tuesday '
            'morning that left a woman dead and Ruggs and his female passenger '
            'injured. Ruggs, 22, will be charged with DUI leading to death '
            'after the Chevrolet Corvette he was driving slammed at high speed '
            'into the rear of a Toyota Rav4 on a busy thoroughfare in a '
            'residential area several miles west of the Las Vegas Strip at '
            'about 3.40am on Tuesday. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police '
            'Department said: “[R]esponding officers located the Toyota on '
            'fire. Fire department personnel responded and located a deceased '
            'victim inside the Toyota. The preliminary investigation indicates '
            'the front of the Chevrolet collided with the rear of the Toyota.” '
            'Ruggs suffered minor injuries in the crash. “The driver of the '
            'Chevrolet, identified as 22-year-old Henry Rugs (sic) III, '
            'remained on scene and showed signs of impairment. He was '
            'transported to UMC hospital to be treated for '
            'non-life-threatening injuries. Ruggs will be charged with DUI '
            'resulting in death. This is an on-going investigation,” the '
            'department added in its statement. If convicted, Ruggs would face '
            'between two and 20 years in prison.\n'
            'The Raiders said in a statement that they were aware Ruggs had '
            'been involved in a crash. “We are devastated by the loss of life '
            'and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim’s family. We '
            'are in the process of gathering information and will have no '
            'further comment at this time,” read the statement. NFL spokesman '
            'Brian McCarthy issued a statement saying: “Our hearts go out to '
            'the family and friends of the victim of this horrific tragedy. We '
            'will continue to gather facts and monitor the matter under our '
            'policies, but our thoughts at this time are with those impacted '
            'by this devastating incident.” Ruggs lost a close friend, Rod '
            'Scott, in a car crash in 2016. He often pays tribute to Scott by '
            'raising his fingers to the sky during games. The Raiders had a '
            'bye week on their schedule and did not play last weekend. Their '

            'NFL draft and he signed a fully guaranteed four-year contract '

{'article': 'The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has agreed to meet the family '
            'of the British-Iranian dual national Anoosheh Ashoori who is '
            'being held in Evin prison in Tehran. They are calling on the '
            'Foreign Office to give him the same diplomatic protection as that '
            'granted to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The move comes as Nazanin’s '
            'husband, Richard Ratcliffe, enters the 11th day of a hunger '
            'strike outside the Foreign Office. He is pressing the UK '
            'government to pay the £400m debt it owes to Iran from a court '
            'case dating back to the 1970s. Iran has made it clear that '
            'although the debt is a standalone issue, its payment would help '
            'with the release of British-Iranian detainees. In an act of '
            'solidarity between the two campaigns, Ashoori’s son, Aryan, was '
            'due to join Ratcliffe outside the department. The two campaigns '
            'support each other, although there is some discomfort among '
            'Ashoori’s supporters that the media and some politicians have '
            'persistently given a higher profile to the Ratcliffe case. The '
            'Foreign Office had initially told Ashoori’s family that the '
            'Middle East minister, James Cleverly, could meet them and his '
            'lawyers who are working pro-bono. They insisted that as Ratcliffe '
            'met Truss last week they should also be entitled to see the '
            'foreign secretary. The meeting between Ratcliffe and Truss was '
            'largely unproductive, but it was acknowledged that the foreign '
            'secretary had shown her personal concern. In theory diplomatic '
            'protection elevates a case to state dispute, making it no longer '
            'a consular case. It is arguable how useful diplomatic protection, '
            'granted by a previous foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, has proved '
            'for Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\n'
            'Ashooori was given a 10-year jail sentence for allegedly spying, '
            'and has had two brief furloughs before returning to jail. He has '
            'been on hunger strike in the past, and so far has served four '
            'years. Ashoori’s family are likely to ask Truss for her views on '
            'remarks by Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the Iranian foreign '
            'minister, who claimed he confronted Truss as to why the UK had at '
            'the last minute backed out of a deal that would have seen a '
            'humanitarian exchange of prisoners including Ashoori and '
            'Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He alleged the US, 24 hours before the '
            'exchange, “suddenly announced to the British to wait and to make '
            'this exchange conditional on the nuclear talks … at the 90th '
            'minute, the Americans connect a completely humanitarian issue to '
            'the Vienna talks and the nuclear issue, and prevent this '
            'exchange. This is not at all acceptable and issues must be '
            'separated.” There is no independent verification of his account, '
            'but UK sources have admitted they were very close in June to a '
            'prisoner swap.',

{'article': 'The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse trial began on Tuesday in Kenosha, '
            'Wisconsin, where the 18-year-old is charged with killing two '
            'people and wounding one during unrest in the city last August. '
            'Prosecutors said that although “hundreds” of people were out on '
            'the street during protests over the shooting of a Black man by a '
            'white police officer, Rittenhouse was “the only person who killed '
            'anyone”. Rittenhouse is charged with two counts of homicide, one '
            'of attempted homicide and two of recklessly endangering safety '
            'for firing his weapon near others. He is also charged with '
            'possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor, as he was 17 at the '
            'time. He has pleaded not guilty. In August last year, Rittenhouse '
            'traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, armed with an '
            'AR-15-style rifle and in response to a Kenosha-based militia '
            'calling for protection for businesses against protesters '
            'supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Rittenhouse is white, '
            'as were the two men who died and as is the one who was wounded. '
            'Nonetheless, the case has drawn attention from both sides of the '
            'political divide over policing and racial injustice. On Monday, '
            '12 jurors and eight alternates were selected in an all-day '
            'session. The highly contentious trial, which is expected to last '
            'approximately two weeks, will determine whether Rittenhouse acted '
            'in self-defense or in an intentional act of vigilantism. The '
            'judge, Bruce Shroeder, said he would decide at the end of the '
            'trial which jurors were alternates and which would deliberate. '
            '“There is no magical way for you to evaluate the testimony,” he '
            'said on Tuesday. “Instead, you should use your common sense and '
            'your experiences in life.” Rittenhouse looked on, dressed in suit '
            'and tie and yawning repeatedly. Shroeder said the state must '
            'prove by evidence three elements of Rittenhouse’s homicide '
            'charges: that the defendant caused the death of another, that the '
            'defendant caused the death by criminally reckless conduct, and '
            'that the defendant’s conduct showed utter disregard for human '
            'life. “You cannot look into a person’s mind to determine intent, '
            'which must be found, if it is to be found at all,” Schroeder '
            'said, adding: “Intent should not be confused with motive.” In his '
            'opening statement, Kenosha county assistant district attorney '
            'Thomas Binger portrayed Rittenhouse as an antagonist who chose to '
            'exacerbate tensions. “Like moths to a flame, tourists from '
            'outside our community were drawn to the chaos here in Kenosha,” '
            'said Binger. “People from outside Kenosha came in and contributed '
            'to that chaos. “The evidence will show that hundreds of people '
            'were out on the street experiencing chaos and violence, and the '
            'only person who killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle '
            'Rittenhouse.” Binger added: “When we consider the reasonableness '
            'of the defendant’s actions, I ask you to keep that in mind. We’re '
            'not asking you to solve a mystery in this case.” Rittenhouse’s '
            'lead lawyer, Mark Richards, argued that Rittenhouse had close '
            'ties to Kenosha as his father lived in the city and he had worked '
            'as a lifeguard at a local YMCA. “Mr Binger makes a big thing out '
            'of Kyle Rittenhouse as the only person who shot somebody that '
            'evening,” Richards said. “True. Mr Rittenhouse was the only '
            'person who was chased by Joseph Rosenbaum that evening.” '
            'Rosenbaum was one of the men fatally shot by Rittenhouse, who he '
            'chased across a parking lot and at whom he threw a plastic bag. '
            '“The government can refer to [Rittenhouse] all they wish as an '
            'active shooter,” Richards said. “The only person he had shot was '
            'Joseph Rosenbuam, who had made threats to kill. “… Kyle '
            'Rittenhouse protected himself, protected his firearm so it '
            'couldn’t be taken and used against him or other people from Mr '
            'Rosenbaum, who made threats to kill.” Richards also said “other '
            'individuals who didn’t see that shooting attacked [Rittenhouse] '
            'in the street like an animal”. The trial continues.',

{'article': 'The middle of the Cop26 climate conference was not an ideal '
            'moment to demonstrate that producing, refining and trading '
            'hydrocarbons remains a spectacularly lucrative business when the '
            'stars align. “We’re a cash machine at these types of prices,” '
            'declared the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, cheerfully, '
            'referring to oil at $85 a barrel and gas still at multi-year '
            'highs. His description is accurate. The oddity of accounting '
            'rules around hedging policies meant BP showed a formal loss in '
            'the third quarter of this year, but the surer guide to the '
            'current financial bonanza was the underlying profit of $3.3bn '
            '(£2.2bn). Remember that BP barely broke even in the equivalent '
            'period last year. The vaccine-led recovery in the global economy '
            'has transformed the outlook. So time for BP to revisit its '
            'year-old targets for boosting investment in renewables? Use the '
            'current excess of cash to up the pace? Well, no, that is not on '
            'the agenda. Looney is sticking to what he promised: a doubling of '
            'investment in low-carbon projects this year to $2bn, mainly '
            'offshore wind and solar, with an increase to $5bn a year by 2030. '
            'The extra cash will instead go to shareholders.\n'
            'The share buyback pledges, it has to be said, are large. The cash '
            'machine has been programmed to buy a further $1.25bn of shares '
            'before next February. Then the buybacks will continue at rate of '
            'at least $1bn a quarter as long as oil prices stay above $60 a '
            'barrel. That’s on top of a dividend worth $4bn a year. In round '
            'terms, BP’s distributions to shareholders are back where they '
            'stood before the pandemic: the dividend has been roughly halved, '
            'but buybacks would make up the difference. Naturally, BP would '
            'argue – with some justification – that its investors would scream '
            'blue murder if they were denied their buyback spoils when oil and '
            'gas prices are high. The promise of extra distributions in good '
            'times was part of the same “financial framework” that plots BP’s '
            'intended path to net zero by 2050 – a framework that is meant to '
            'withstand any plunge in oil and gas prices. After a single lap of '
            'the track, there was no chance of Looney rejigging the arithmetic '
            'to accelerate renewables further. But it is the next question if '
            'oil is still at $85 this time next year. In the “transformation” '
            'business, which is what BP says it is doing, pace matters. It is '
            'not compulsory to throw every spare dollar at share buybacks. '
            'THG: caught between a BlackRock and a hard place\n'
            'BlackRock has been an investor in THG, or The Hut Group as it '
            'was, for about a decade, so well before the ecommerce retailer '
            'arrived on the stock market a year ago. The world’s largest fund '
            'manager even bought more stock in the IPO, or flotation, emerging '
            'as the second-largest holder after founder Matthew Moulding. The '
            'decision to flog almost half the stake – or 58m shares – '
            'therefore looks significant. There was some muttering about '
            'portfolio rebalancing, but none of it convincing. There’s only '
            'one way to read events when you’re a buyer at IPO at 500p and '
            'large seller at 195p a year later: you’ve changed your view of '
            'the long-term risks and rewards. Naturally, THG’s share price '
            'moved almost directly to the BlackRock’s disposal price, implying '
            'a fall on the day of 9%. January’s zany valuation of 800p feels a '
            'world away. Moulding, trying to fight the crisis by belatedly '
            'preaching a gospel of governance reform, needs to find a credible '
            'non-executive chairman sharpish. BlackRock has not made the task '
            'easier.\n'
            'Unfavourable results fuel poor results at Flutter Bookies always '
            'publicise the brief periods when the punters win. It’s good for '
            'business. So the £60m hit from “unfavourable sporting results” '
            'got star billing within Flutter’s update. Champions League '
            'football, international football, American football and Tyson '
            'Fury got the blame (or credit). It was enough for a downwards '
            'tweak to Flutter’s annual profits forecast, though £1.25bn-ish '
            'still sounds OK. All that has happened is a touch of mean '
            'reversion. The Paddy Power and Betfair group’s win margin had '
            'been a fraction better than normal earlier in the year. The share '
            'price, after its rip-roaring run on the back of prospects in the '
            'liberalising US market, fell 8%. But at least part of the drop '
            'can be explained by the lack of the fresh news on the idea of '
            'listing the US FanDuel business, the local number one in a sports '
            'betting market that could be enormous. Logic says it will happen '
            'because US market valuations for betting businesses are so much '
            'higher. The odd footie result is almost irrelevant by comparison. '
            'Having whetted appetites, Flutter can’t maintain the suspense '
            'indefinitely.',

            'historic gas market highs continue to rip through the UK’s energy '
            'market amid fresh fears that Russia may curb gas supplies to '
            'Europe. The energy regulator, Ofgem, said the collapse of four '
            'small energy suppliers on Tuesday would leave about 24,000 '
            'households in need of a new supplier, and bring the total number '
            'of bust energy companies to 17 since the start of September, '
            'affecting more than 2 million households. The flurry of failures '
            'follows rocketing global energy market prices due to a sudden '
            'surge in demand for gas as economies began to shrug off '
            'restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Gas markets have '
            'reached record highs in recent weeks, leading to one of the '
            'sharpest increases in home energy bills and fears of a '
            'cost-of-living crisis this winter. Out of the four UK casualties '
            'Zebra Power had the largest customer base, and supplied 14,800 '
            'households with energy. Omni Energy supplied about 6,000 domestic '
            'pre-payment customers, while AmpowerUK had about 600 UK customers '
            'and supplied a further 2,000 overseas households. MA Energy had '
            'about 300 overseas customers. Scores more energy suppliers are '
            'expected to collapse in the months ahead as gas markets remain at '
            'near-record highs, and suppliers are forced to shoulder the '
            'higher costs without raising their tariffs above the regulator’s '
            'energy price cap. Consumer charity Citizens Advice said '
            'struggling households would ultimately pay the price “with '
            'uncertainty, inconvenience and ultimately higher bills” as '
            'suppliers continue “to fall like dominoes”. Gillian Cooper, the '
            'head of energy at Citizens Advice, said: “Last week, Ofgem set '
            'out how it intends to ‘raise the bar’ for supplier standards and '
            'improve their resilience in the short term. This is a positive '
            'step, but it’s clear that existing rules and their enforcement, '
            'has not been enough.” Cooper added: “Longer-term, Ofgem will need '
            'to do more to make sure companies are financially sound and '
            'provide good customer service. This should include protecting '
            'people from the loyalty penalty, which prior to the cap allowed '
            'companies to profit from those who didn’t or couldn’t switch.” '
            'The energy regulator set out plans for “bold action” last week to '
            'fasttrack changes to its price cap, which protects around 15 '
            'million households from unfair energy bills, following growing '
            'calls from suppliers to make the cap more flexible so that market '
            'increases can be passed on to households sooner. The price cap '
            'overhaul has emerged amid deepening concerns that gas prices, '
            'which are more than three times higher than this time last year, '
            'may resume their upward climb as temperatures plunge across '
            'Europe and Russia squeezes gas exports to Europe. Gas flows from '
            'Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom, which supplies about a '
            'third of Europe’s gas, dropped significantly over the weekend and '
            'on Tuesday the company declined to offer extra gas supplies to '
            'Europe from January, when demand is often at its highest for the '
            'winter. The slowdown in gas exports has reignited fears over the '
            'winter’s energy suppliers despite a direct order from the Russian '
            'president, Vladimir Putin, for Gazprom to focus on filling its '
            'European gas storage facilities from 8 November, when Russian '
            'domestic storage should be filled.\n'
            'Russia’s decision not to open its gas taps to allow extra '
            'supplies into Europe from January also defies calls from the '
            'global energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, which '
            'said last month that Russia should help to ease market prices by '
            'boosting gas exports to Europe this winter. Moscow has denied it '
            'is withholding gas supplies from Europe via its pipelines through '
            'Ukraine and Poland to exert pressure on German regulators to '
            'approve gas shipments through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline '
            'across the Baltic Sea to Germany. But its decision to send only '
            'contracted volumes despite the strong demand for extra gas '
            'supplies is likely to raise gas market prices across Europe, '
            'helping Russia to charge more for its hydrocarbon exports.',

{'article': 'Wet wipes which contain plastic are forming “islands” across the '
            'UK after being flushed, with rivers changing shape after the '
            'products pile up on their banks, MPs have heard as legislation '
            'aiming to ban their sale had its first reading in the House of '
            'Commons. Labour MP Fleur Anderson’s plastics (wet wipes) bill '
            'would prohibit the manufacture and sale of wet wipes containing '
            'plastic if it was to pass through parliament and receive royal '
            'assent. However, as a private member’s bill it is unlikely to '
            'become law without government support, although Downing Street '
            'has signalled it is committed to ending “the throwaway culture”. '
            'During the first reading, MPs were told the UK needs to ban wet '
            'wipes which contain plastic because the scale of the problem '
            'caused by flushing them “is so big, so damaging and increasing so '
            'fast”. They also heard that marine animals are dying, while '
            'Britons might be eating a “credit card’s worth of plastic” due to '
            'microplastic shards from the discarded hygiene products. “As a '
            'mother of four children I have used a lot of wet wipes and I '
            'completely understand the pressures that parents are under and '
            'how useful wet wipes are,” Anderson said. “I know that parents '
            'also want to do the right thing for the environment.” But she '
            'added that 90% of the 11bn wet wipes used in the UK each year '
            'contain some form of plastic which, when broken down, turn into '
            'microplastics which can be ingested by wildlife and enter the '
            'food chain and water supply. She added that the problem was '
            'growing, with the Great British Beach Clean reportedly seeing an '
            'increase from 1.7 wet wipes per average 100m of beach to 18 wet '
            'wipes between 2005 and 2020. Anderson told the Commons: “When '
            'these plastics enter our local marine environment and water '
            'systems in such large volumes the damage is absolutely '
            'devastating. Globally, 100 million animals die each year from '
            'plastic waste alone.” She also cited data from the World Wildlife '
            'Fund, which suggested people eat about five grams of plastic a '
            'week, which she described as “literally eating a credit card’s '
            'worth of plastic every week”, claiming wet wipes were a “huge '
            'cause of this”. The MP told of a recent visit to the Thames where '
            'huge piles of wet wipes on the riverbanks had changed how it '
            'flowed, and even described seeing a “wet wipe island” in the '
            'river. Brands such as Holland & Barrett and the Body Shop had '
            'already committed to selling only plastic-free wipes, which are '
            'usually made with bamboo or other plant fibres, Anderson said. '
            'She said a “greater scale of production” of plastic-free wipes '
            'could be encouraged by the ban, making the alternative cheaper. '
            '“We need legislation because the scale of the problem is so big, '
            'so damaging and increasing so fast,” said Anderson. The bill will '
            'be considered again on Friday 19 November. A No 10 spokesperson '
            'said the 25-year environment plan sets out “a commitment to '
            'eliminate avoidable plastic waste”.',

{'article': 'In his justifiably bleak piece (Capitalism is killing the planet '
            '– it’s time to stop buying into our own destruction, 30 October), '
            'George Monbiot claims that the existential crisis facing humanity '
            'has arisen in spite of our “greater intelligence” and “highly '
            'evolved consciousness”. In this aspect of his argument, he is '
            'wrong. Consciousness is an evolutionary process and, in terms of '
            'how far we have progressed, we are still in our infancy. As a '
            'result, we are not yet able to see the bigger picture and our '
            'place not only in the world but in the cosmos. We cannot think '
            'much beyond our next car, meal or overseas holiday – all of them '
            'contributors to systemic environmental collapse. This is '
            'especially true of our political leaders, who cannot think much '
            'beyond the next election. Until we, as a species, attain a much '
            'higher level of consciousness, politicians are unlikely to place '
            'the planet ahead of economic interests, as this largely '
            'determines whether or not they hold on to power. It would be '
            'misplaced, therefore, to expect a major breakthrough on climate '
            'change any time soon. Monbiot rather dismisses the small things '
            'that we, as individuals, can do because, he argues, in the '
            'absence of seismic change, reducing our use of coffee cups or '
            'plastic makes little difference. Having not eaten meat for 15 '
            'years I’ve resolved this week of Cop26 to stop eating dairy. This '
            'small gesture will of course make not one iota of difference to '
            'climate change, but at least I can feel a little better about '
            'myself as we hurtle towards the apocalypse. Quentin Macfarlane '
            'Auchmithie, Angus • George Monbiot criticises thinking about '
            'climate change that focuses on “the tiny issues such as plastic '
            'straws and coffee cups, rather than the huge structural forces '
            'driving us towards catastrophe. We are obsessed with plastic '
            'bags.” Meanwhile, on the Money pages of the print edition, an '
            'article asks how supermarkets rate in their response to the '
            'climate crisis. Four of the five subheadings in the article are '
            'about plastics or packaging, which, while worthy environmental '
            'issues in themselves, have little or no impact on climate change. '
            'The fifth is about cycle racks. Perhaps your Money journalists '
            'could read the Monbiot article and try again? Stephen Warde '
            'Cottenham, Cambridgeshire • Your article on supermarkets’ '
            'progress to achieving “net zero” was interesting. Unfortunately, '
            'the main focus was overwhelmingly to what supermarkets are doing '
            'to end single-use plastic. There was no mention of the critical '
            'role of supermarkets in ensuring the products of rainforest '
            'deforestation do not end up in our shopping baskets. I love my '
            'morning coffee, but only a fraction of the coffee products for '
            'sale in British supermarkets have any claim to be sustainably '
            'sourced. Until we can be confident the products we buy are free '

{'article': 'A 52-year-old man was killed by a ricocheting police bullet when '
            'he refused to leave his room during an attempted arrest, an '
            'inquest has heard. Trevor Smith, a van driver who was suffering '
            'from mental health problems, was fatally shot when officers '
            'attempted to arrest him at his home in Lee Bank, Birmingham, in '
            'the early hours of 15 March 2019. Jurors heard how Smith had been '
            'reported to police by his former partner for threatening '
            'behaviour towards her. She alleged he once held a gun to her '
            'head, and sent her a WhatsApp message showing a gun on his sofa '
            'in which he threatened to “do her in”. She also said that after '
            'they broke up in January 2019, he sent “intimate” videos of her '
            'to friends and had received a number of greetings cards from '
            'Smith containing threats, one of which was a sympathy card with '
            'her photo on it saying: “RIP, you’re always in our thoughts – '
            'not.” Following her complaints, police secured a warrant to '
            'arrest Smith and search his property for the firearm. A black '
            'imitation firearm was discovered at the property. Summarising the '
            'circumstances of Smith’s death, the senior coroner Louise Hunt '
            'said that during the execution of the warrant, Smith remained in '
            'his bedroom where he sat on the end of the bed with a duvet held '
            'in front of him and one of his arms was not visible. A police dog '
            'was brought on the scene and started barking. Smith dropped the '
            'duvet and one of his limbs moved, and one of the police officers '
            'fired a weapon, with the bullet ricocheting off the bed frame and '
            'hitting Smith. Smith received CPR and an ambulance attended the '
            'property, but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. A '
            'postmortem confirmed he died from a single gunshot wound to the '
            'chest. Smith’s family described him as “a very bright, talented '
            'and creative individual”, a well-dressed “fashionista” and an '
            'avid football fan who was popular across Birmingham. “Trevor’s '
            'life mattered and he did not deserve to lose it in this way,” his '
            'sister Lorna Webley said. “One Friday morning, someone took my '
            'brother’s life in three seconds. At this moment, we cannot '
            'explain the proper reason for any good cause for his death.” She '
            'said Smith, a father of two, had “battled with mental health '
            'challenges for many years, often dismissed by others as bad '
            'behaviour” and that he was deeply affected by his father’s death '
            'in 2017. In the months before his death his mother noticed Smith '
            'seemed depressed and his usual smart dress had become unkempt. '
            'The inquest heard that in January 2019, Smith had overdosed in an '
            'attempt to take his own life and left three suicide notes, after '
            'which he was referred to Birmingham and Solihull mental health '
            'NHS foundation trust. Hunt said that over the course of the '
            'inquest, jurors would also hear about an “issue” with the '
            'defibrillator used during resuscitation attempts and “whether '
            'there was any delay in an ambulance attending because there was a '
            'mix-up in the address”. The inquest, being held at Edgbaston '
            'cricket ground because of the Covid pandemic, continues.',

{'article': 'BBC Newsnight editor Esme Wren, who oversaw the programme’s '
            'infamous interview with Prince Andrew, has quit the broadcaster '
            'to become the new boss of Channel 4 News. Her departure leaves '
            'the BBC with yet another influential senior news position to fill '
            'at a time when such appointments are receiving enormous scrutiny '
            'from the government. The BBC is already interviewing for a new '
            'head of news, with cabinet ministers privately speculating about '
            'which candidates they would prefer for that role. The job of '
            'political editor could come up next year if Laura Kuenssberg '
            'steps down as expected. Wren spent three years running Newsnight, '
            'giving it an all-women lineup of Emily Maitlis, Kirsty Wark and '
            'Emma Barnett. The highlight was her team securing the notorious '
            '2019 interview with Prince Andrew about his relationship with '
            'convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This hastened the royal’s '
            'departure from public life – but also led to Wren appearing on '
            'the front cover of the Radio Times, an honour rarely afforded to '
            'the editors of news programmes. She will now replace the outgoing '
            'Ben De Pear as boss of Channel 4 News. One of her first tasks '
            'will be to oversee the transition to a new lead presenter, who '
            'has yet to be recruited, as longstanding host Jon Snow is due to '
            'step down after 32 years in the job. Newsnight has remained '
            'well-resourced with its own dedicated editor and team of '
            'journalists at a time when many other BBC programmes have lost '
            'their own staff due to the ongoing centralisation of the '
            'broadcaster’s news teams. This has led to some jealousy from '
            'other BBC reporters who have been forced to move jobs, who point '
            'out Newsnight currently only attracts about 400,000 viewers a '
            'night on BBC Two. Channel 4 News also has a question mark over '
            'its long-term future due to the looming decision on whether to '
            'push ahead with the privatisation of the broadcaster. Ministers '
            'have suggested they would retain Channel 4’s news and current '
            'affairs output in any privatisation, while ITN has an ongoing '
            'deal to keep making the programme that would be expensive to '
            'break. However, Channel 4 News’ reputation as a thorn in the side '
            'of the government has attracted opprobrium from some ministers, '
            'and there are long-term fears about a new private owner finding '
            'ways to cut its budget. Wren said Channel 4 News has led “some of '
            'the most significant investigations of our time” and she wanted '
            'to find ways to speak “to young and underserved audiences”.',

            'fund despite being among the least deprived fifth of local '

            'constituency of Bromsgrove got £14.5m in the first announced '
            'tranche of cash under the scheme. Central Bedfordshire, which '
            'received £26.7m in levelling-up funding for transport '
            'improvements and a community wellbeing hub, is partly represented '
            'by Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. Lewes council, which is '
            'represented by the Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, received the '
            'ninth-largest per capita award despite being among the least '
            'deprived 40% of local authorities. Lewes received funding for '
            'local seafood industries and will also benefit from an East '
            'Sussex bid for a new road bridge in Seaford. A number of areas of '
            'high deprivation received large awards, including Burnley and '
            'Stoke-on-Trent, which got £19.9m and £56m respectively. Alex '
            'Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, which includes an '
            'area that missed out on funding, said: “The Tories like to talk a '
            'good game on levelling up, but this is yet more proof that it is '
            'an empty slogan and that pork barrel politics is the name of the '
            'game. “I think it’s high time that the prime minister, chancellor '
            'and levelling-up secretary come clean and explain to the people '
            'of Billingham, and other areas that have significant levels of '
            'deprivation but missed out on much needed funding, why they feel '
            'places like Yarm and Eaglescliffe in the Tees Valley, and '
            'Bromsgrove and Central Bedfordshire further afield, are more '
            'deserving of the levelling-up cash than they are.” The '
            'government’s levelling-up fund is designed to combat regional '
            'inequality by investing in infrastructure that “brings pride to a '
            'local area”, according to the scheme’s prospectus. Just under '
            'half of the 65 English local authorities that will benefit from '
            'funding announced in last week’s budget are among the country’s '
            'most deprived fifth. However, Bromsgrove, Central Bedfordshire '
            'and the Isles of Scilly – which is to receive funding for a ferry '
            'service – are among the country’s least deprived. Although more '
            'Labour councils than Conservative-controlled ones received '
            'funding in this first tranche, Tory councils did better per '
            'capita at £93 per head of population compared with £65 per head '
            'for Labour councils. Councils with no overall control received '
            '£102 per head while the two Liberal Democrat areas announced thus '
            'far, Eastbourne and Hinckley and Bosworth, are in line to receive '
            '£183 per capita. Where funding was originally allocated to a '
            'county council or city region, the Guardian analysis split the '
            'funding across the lower-tier councils that will benefit from a '
            'scheme. The announced funding is part of the Conservative party’s '
            'broader “levelling-up agenda”. Other announcements have already '
            'been made under the towns fund and the future high streets fund '
            'while a further pot, the £220m community renewal fund, is yet to '
            'be announced. The first tranche of the £4.8bn levelling-up fund '
            'announced last week included cultural regeneration funding for '
            'Liverpool’s waterfront and the reopening of the Whorlton Bridge '
            'over the River Tees. A spokesperson for the Department for '
            'Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “This analysis is '
            'nonsense. The selection process for the levelling-up fund is '
            'transparent, robust and fair, and we publish the criteria on '
            'gov.uk. “The first round of funding will help to ensure '
            'opportunity is spread more equally across the UK by empowering '
            'local leaders, improving public services and restoring pride in '
            'place.” This article was amended on 2 November 2021. A '
            'Beatles-inspired attraction in Liverpool will not be funded by '
            'the levelling-up fund as an earlier version stated.',

{'article': 'The Bank of England is facing criticism over the way it is '
            'conducting its first climate stress tests, with politicians and '
            'campaigners warning that a lack of penalties for dirty assets '
            'will give banks little incentive to clean up their act. While the '
            'regulator has been praised for committing to the exercise, the '
            'Bank of England has come under fire for so far refusing to '
            'publish data for individual firms, and stopping short of '
            'introducing immediate capital requirements, which would make it '
            'more expensive to offer loans and services to fossil fuel '
            'companies and high carbon projects. Campaigners are concerned '
            'that one of the UK’s most lucrative industries is being given a '
            'free pass. “Finance is one of the priorities of Cop26, but the '
            'UK’s credibility as hosts risks being undermined by the fact it '
            'has let its banks pour more than £200bn into fossil fuels since '
            'the Paris agreement was signed,” the Green MP Caroline Lucas told '
            'the Guardian. “It needs to rectify these failures if it is to '
            'have any credibility during climate finance negotiations.” The '
            'Bank of England is not the only regulator moving cautiously. So '
            'far, the European Central Bank and the Banque de France – which '
            'are among the few central banks to have conducted climate stress '
            'tests for their respective financial sectors to date – have only '
            'published aggregate data covering their finance industries, and '
            'have not introduced any restrictions, or deterrents, for banks '
            'serving polluting firms. That is despite warnings from both '
            'regulators that banks will be severely affected unless they ramp '
            'up their response to the climate crisis. Any deviation from the '
            'Paris agreement would result in higher loan losses for banks, '
            'according to the ratings agency Moody’s, rising anywhere from '
            '3.5% in the “least disorderly” scenario, to 20% under the most '
            'extreme climate outcomes. It has raised concerns that the banking '
            'sector itself will suffer financially without swift action, which '
            'could had a ripple effect throughout the global economy. '
            'Globally, reporting standards are low. A report by the Task Force '
            'on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD) published last '
            'year found that while bank reporting has improved since 2017, the '
            'sector continues to have the lowest percentage of disclosure for '
            'climate-related targets across all global industries, with 19% of '
            'firms meeting TFCD standards. By comparison, figures for the '
            'energy and transport sectors are 44% and 35% respectively. Part '
            'of the challenge is that regulators are intent on gathering as '
            'much data as possible before introducing deterrents such as '
            'capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial '
            'cushion that banks must hold to protect them from risky loans and '
            'products on their balance sheets. With such a complex exercise '
            'that looks at potential climate scenarios over the next 30 years, '
            'campaigners say the Bank of England may be setting an impossible '
            'task. Its first climate tests – which it has not yet committed to '
            'repeat after this year – are far more complex than the '
            'regulator’s annual financial stress tests, which were introduced '
            'after the 2008 banking crash and measure banks’ resilience '
            'against economic shocks like a surge in unemployment, or a sudden '
            'collapse in house prices. Instead, the climate tests will put '
            'banks through three scenarios with a 30-year time horizon, '
            'covering physical and transition risks, including one in which '
            'governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas '
            'emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C, '
            'and a 3.9-metre rise in sea levels. The exercise will also look '
            'at how those scenarios could affect potential loan losses, as '
            'customers default on their loans due to slowing growth and '
            'economic uncertainty. “If you’re looking for the perfect data '
            'set, you’re going to be disappointed because it’s never going to '
            'happen – there is always uncertainty” said James Vaccaro, who is '
            'an executive director of the Climate Safe Lending Network, which '
            'represents banks, academics and investors hoping to decarbonise '
            'the banking sector. “You’re always trying to extrapolate the '
            'past, but right now in terms of climate change, the past is not a '
            'good predictor at all of the likely future,” he said. If that was '
            'not challenging enough, the Bank of England is also letting '
            'lenders determine how they measure their exposure to those '
            'climate risks individually, a move that it believes will foster '
            'innovation and unearth best practices that can be shared across '
            'the industry. However, that means it will take even longer for UK '
            'banks to produce comparable data that will help the public, '
            'governments and investors determine where they should apply the '
            'most pressure, or pull their business. “At the moment the '
            'financial system is enabling and financing the forces that are '
            'driving climate change,” Lord Oates, the Liberal Democrats’ '
            'spokesperson for energy and climate change in the Lords, said. '
            '“And so the regulators have a duty to act now [and] in the '
            'absence of perfect information.”\n'
            'International regulators have proved they are willing to consider '
            'capital requirements when new risks emerge. In June, the Basel '
            'Committee on Banking Supervision, which consists of regulators '
            'from the world’s leading financial centres, highlighted the '
            'potential risk around cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying '
            'banks should be forced to put aside enough capital to cover 100% '
            'of potential losses. Campaigners are calling for similar rules '
            'for climate risks. Last week, activists and academics including '
            'the historian Adam Tooze, signed an open letter to the Cop26 '
            'president, Alok Sharma, calling for the introduction of one-for '
            'one capital requirements, meaning that for every pound invested '
            'in fossil fuel projects, financial institutions such as banks and '
            'insurers would need to hold the equivalent to absorb future '
            'losses. But not all central bankers are convinced that capital '
            'requirements on dirty assets will fully protect against financial '
            'shocks, since renewable energy and other innovative green assets '
            'could carry investment risks. There are also concerns that '
            'introducing capital requirements could cause market turmoil, '
            'since forcing a swathe of banks to raise money simultaneously '
            'could spook investors and make it more expensive for lenders to '
            'secure funds. However, Vaccaro warned that near-term pain might '
            'be necessary to create a sustainable future for both the climate '
            'and financial system. “We are potentially and unwittingly, '
            'perhaps even unconsciously, sacrificing long-term stability for '
            'short-term stability. In other words: don’t rock the apple cart '
            'now. But by not rocking it we basically totally hobble it from '
            'the perspective of actually getting it fit for the massive shocks '

{'article': 'In the immediate aftermath of a gruelling but ultimately '
            'thrilling victory over Sri Lanka on Monday, Eoin Morgan was – as '
            'he had for so long earlier that evening – restraining himself, '
            'refusing to let circumstance and emotion carry him away. The '
            'match may have ended for England in a joyful clatter of wickets '
            'and the increasingly familiar taste of success, but Morgan’s mind '
            'was stuck on the period between him arriving at the crease with '
            'his team’s innings still young and hitting his first boundary, '
            'eight overs that rank among the most awkward of his career. “Jos '
            '[Buttler] and I talked about it being as hard as we’d faced just '
            'to get the ball away, never mind looking for boundaries,” he '
            'said. “A normal risk-taking shot would have been sweeps, but we '
            'didn’t feel sweeps were on with the guys they were bowling and '
            'the way the wicket didn’t really bounce at that time. We’re '
            'thankful that we just hung in and trusted in our experience. Even '
            'really quiet overs, shocking really, but we had nowhere to go, '
            'literally nothing to do, and it was better than just slogging it '
            'up in the air.” With Sri Lanka’s two spinners, Maheesh Theekshana '
            'and especially Wanindu Hasaranga outstanding, and their seamers '
            'providing disciplined support – at least until they lost their '
            'length in the latter stages of England’s innings – Buttler’s '
            'first 50 was his slowest in international Twenty20 cricket. He '
            'may have ended the innings with a 67-ball century but it took '
            'until his 46th delivery – the ball before Morgan finally scored '
            'his first boundary – to reach halfway.\n'
            '“Even Jos, who’s in unbelievable form, really did find it tough. '
            'When I got to the wicket he talked about just getting something '
            'going, and even he struggled to rotate the strike,” Morgan said. '
            '“You take in all that information and realise how tough it is, '
            'and believe it will get better or you will get a bad ball, and '
            'even if you don’t you’re still doing the right thing and trusting '
            'the process.” There are several possible criticisms of England’s '
            'innings: when Hasaranga dismissed Jonny Bairstow in the sixth '
            'over they might have promoted Moeen Ali, who is in excellent form '
            'and has a good record against spin, rather than send in their '
            'captain; once batting Morgan might have shown intent more quickly '
            'given the batting talent to follow, most of which ended up '
            'unused; and any strategy that results in a score of 47 for three '
            'at halfway and is entirely reliant on Buttler compiling the '
            'greatest innings of his career – Morgan admitted that “without '
            'that absolutely unbelievable knock we’d have been nowhere” – is '
            'not a very good one. But the 35-year-old insisted that he and '
            'Buttler were always playing to a plan. Asked to recall his first '
            'boundary, a sweep for four off Hasaranga, he said: “I took a '
            'gamble, it worked, it came off, it’s what happens. You have to '
            'take risks at different stages. I didn’t take one before then '
            'because we didn’t think it was really necessary.”\n'
            'This is a really telling statement. Before scoring 40 against Sri '
            'Lanka Morgan had managed only 46 runs in his 10 previous Twenty20 '
            'innings for club and country, a sequence that in many might '
            'provoke significant soul-searching. He then came in, scored only '
            'eight runs off his first 19 balls on a difficult surface, watched '
            'his team’s tally creep to 61 for three after 12 overs and still '
            'thought his partnership with Buttler would end up being so '
            'fruitful risks were not really necessary. It is a level of '
            'confidence in yourself and in your teammates that is simply '
            'awe-inspiring in scale. “You sort of always have to believe,” '
            'Morgan said of his own form, “because if you don’t believe nobody '
            'else will.” This is why Buttler enthused after the game that, '
            'even if it was much less comfortable than their wins over West '
            'Indies, Bangladesh and Australia, “what this will do for us as a '
            'side is fantastic”. It was a night when nearly everything went '
            'wrong, and still enough went right. Apart from one dropped catch '
            'England’s fielding was outstanding and, despite the dew and the '
            'heat – on a steamy night in Sharjah Chris Jordan sweated so '
            'profusely a coach had to be positioned just across the rope with '
            'a bespoke Jordan-mopping beach towel – every bowler impressed '
            'except Tymal Mills. He limped off with a quad injury after nine '
            'balls which went for 19 runs – and England’s medical team are '
            'awaiting results of a scan with crossed fingers, as Mark Wood is '
            'not yet pain-free after his ankle injury. But the greatest impact '
            'of the victory will be on England’s mindset: it might have taken '
            'a miracle innings to save them from defeat, but now they believe '
            'in miracles.',

{'article': 'My friend Derek Hood, who has died aged 56 from cancer, managed '
            'to succeed in two very different fields of creativity – rock '
            'drumming and design-based fine bookbinding. Behind the drum kit, '
            'playing in bands such as All About Eve and the Auteurs, he was a '
            'solid, inventive presence who, being a songwriter himself, always '
            'played with an innate sense of musicality. In his book design '
            'studio in Bath, he worked on commissions for collectors and '
            'institutions around the world. His books were exhibited in the '
            'V&A, the British Library and the bibliophile Grolier club in New '
            'York. Derek was born in St Andrews, Fife, to Mae (nee McCulloch) '
            'and Tom Hood. He went to school at Madras college, leaving at 16, '
            'and was encouraged to join the successful family-run DIY store '
            'business in St Andrews, along with his elder brothers and younger '
            'sister. Punk rock, and the Clash in particular, had fired Derek’s '
            'musical imagination, however. By then a drummer in a local band, '
            'he instead pursued a rebellious path of resistance, opting to '
            'work as an assistant school janitor.\n'
            'At first somewhat reluctantly, he went on to study printing and '
            'bookbinding at Napier University in Edinburgh, before working as '
            'a fine binder at the library of the University of St Andrews, '
            'where his keen artist’s eye and craftsman’s obsession with detail '
            'came to the fore. After Derek moved to London in 1994, his '
            'drumming skills pulled him back into music, and he played and '
            'recorded with such diverse bands as Baader Meinhof, Grand Drive '
            'and Babybird. Of his musical talent, Julianne Regan of All About '
            'Eve remembers that – as captured on the group’s 2001 album Live '
            'and Electric at the Union Chapel – “Del was able to balance '
            'living in the moment of flow, with maintaining a considerate '
            'awareness of the aesthetic of the overall sound, and of the '
            'experience of his bandmates.” In his later years as a bookbinder, '
            'Derek was regularly invited by the organisers of the Booker prize '
            'to create one of the bespoke, one-off editions commissioned for '
            'each of the six shortlisted titles, which were then gifted to the '
            'authors. The 2020 winner, Douglas Stuart, author of Shuggie Bain, '
            'took to social media to praise Derek’s “beautiful, hand-bound '
            'special edition… a terrific job”. Those close to Derek will '
            'remember him for his infectiously buoyant personality, '
            'freewheeling and surreal humour and sense of empathy. He is '
            'survived by his wife, Wendy (nee Jeacock), whom he married in '
            '1999, and their children, Dylan and Cecily.',

            'The woman, named by detectives as 52-year-old Dawn Walker, of '
            'Halifax, was found dead in the village of Lightcliffe, three '
            'miles east of Halifax, West Yorkshire, on Sunday. Her family paid '

            'daughter, mother, nanna, sister, auntie and friend. “In '
            'circumstances beyond our control, you were taken from us so '

            'YorkshireLive that Walker had a young son and got married the '
            'previous Wednesday. The friend, who asked not to be named, said '
            'Walker was kind, caring and friendly. Her body had been '
            'discovered in a suitcase on a grassed area at the back of some '
            'trees in Lightcliffe, which was cordoned off by police. “She got '
            'married on Wednesday and died on Sunday morning,” the friend '
            'said. “Dawn was a sound woman. She got married on Wednesday and '
            'now this has happened. “She was the soundest person you could '

            'behalf of everyone in the ward, our thoughts and prayers go out '
            'to those that have lost their loved one. This is all very raw, '
            'and it would be improper to speculate on the circumstances.” '
            'Robinson said he had contacted the council and police to ask what '
            'plans there were to engage and support the local community. “I’ve '
            'also asked if the local schools have been briefed and how our '
            'young people will be supported,” he said. “We’re a closeknit '

            'everyone. Please do check in on your neighbours to ensure they '

{'article': 'Leaves on the line may have been behind a train crash at '
            'Salisbury that left 13 passengers needing hospital treatment and '
            'a driver with life-changing injuries, it has emerged. Inspectors '
            'from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said early '
            'findings pointed to “low adhesion between the wheels and the '
            'track” as the reason why the South Western service failed to stop '
            'at the junction where two lines merged and crashed into the side '
            'of a Great Western train. Such low adhesion is most often caused '
            'by leaves on the line. The collision was the first significant '
            'crash between two moving trains in passenger service in two '
            'decades. Andrew Hall, RAIB’s deputy chief inspector, said on '
            'Tuesday: “From the initial evidence we have collected, we know '
            'that that the passage of the Great Western train travelling from '
            'Eastleigh across Salisbury tunnel junction was being protected by '
            'a red signal. At this junction, trains coming from Eastleigh '
            'merge with those from Basingstoke, so the South Western service '
            'coming from Basingstoke was required to stop at that signal. '
            '“Unfortunately, it did not stop and struck the side of the Great '
            'Western train at an angle such that both trains derailed and ran '
            'alongside each other into the tunnel just beyond the junction. '
            '“Initial evidence indicates that the South Western train driver '
            'applied the brakes as it approached the junction and the red '
            'signal, but the train was unable to stop before passing the '
            'signal. “This evidence suggests that the most likely cause of '
            'this was wheelslide, almost certainly a result of low adhesion '
            'between the wheels and the track. We are continuing to pursue '
            'this as a line of investigation amongst others.” Hall said the '
            'RAIB had worked with British Transport Police to examine the '
            'track and train, and they were continuing to analyse evidence '
            'from the trains’ data recorders, signalling systems and CCTV. He '
            'said the investigation was “progressing well” and fuller initial '
            'findings would be published later this week. Train services have '
            'been disrupted in the area since Sunday, but inspectors said they '
            'would be able to hand parts of the crash scene back to Network '
            'Rail later on Tuesday. The collision happened at about 6.45pm on '
            'Sunday when the a South Western Railway train from London '
            'Waterloo to Honiton in Devon ran into the GWR train from '
            'Southampton to Cardiff, as they entered the Fisherton tunnel '
            'close to the centre of Salisbury, carrying 92 passengers in '
            'total. Gareth Dennis, a railway engineer and writer, said the '
            'most likely cause of the “low adhesion” was leaves. He said: “The '
            'South Western train was shown red to wait. It looks like as he '
            'applied the brakes there was a low adhesion event – the wheels '
            'were sliding. This is a serious problem we have had on our '
            'railways for a long time.” Dennis said he believed there were two '
            'possible reasons. In some conditions a mist can sit on the rails. '
            'But he said it was more likely that leaves were involved. “Given '
            'the season, I would put money on leaf fall,” he said. “You get a '
            'mulchy paste forming on the rails, which is an incredibly '
            'effective lubricant.” The approach to the tunnel is tree-lined, '
            'and Dennis said: “It is best not to have trees overhanging.” '
            'Martin Frobisher, Network Rail’s safety and engineering director, '
            'said: “Sunday’s accident was incredibly frightening for everyone '
            'involved and our thoughts are with everyone injured or affected '
            'in any way. “Initial findings suggest that low adhesion played a '
            'key part in causing the collision. It’s an issue that affects '
            'railways across the world and is something that we, and our train '
            'operator colleagues, work hard to combat – so that we can run '
            'trains safely and reliably throughout autumn, and why incidents '
            'such as the one in Salisbury at the weekend are incredibly rare. '
            '“We will continue to work closely with investigators to '
            'understand what happened and what more we can do to help prevent '
            'this happening again.”',

{'article': 'US president Joe Biden has unveiled a multinational plan to '
            'control methane, regarded by the administration as the single '
            'most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. '
            'Leading an alliance of 90 countries, including for the first time '
            'Brazil, on Tuesday Biden set out new regulatory measures to limit '
            'global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of '
            'the decade. The alliance includes two-thirds of the global '
            'economy and half of the top 30 major methane emitter countries. '
            'China, India and Russia have not joined the pact known as the '
            'Global Methane Pledge.\n'
            'The pledge was first announced in September but Biden’s officials '
            'have since been working hard to increase the number of '
            'signatories and the momentum behind the pledge. The detailed US '
            'proposals may prove to be one of the lasting successes of the '
            'Cop26 climate conference being held in Glasgow. Many of the '
            'regulatory measures do not require Congressional approval, and so '
            'give Biden some short-term effective measures to which he can '
            'point. The oil and gas industry is reckoned to be responsible for '
            '30% of methane emissions in the US. A new Environment Protection '
            'Agency rule that regulates leak detection and repair in the oil '
            'industry repealed by Donald Trump will be restored and for the '
            'first time applied to new operations in gas, including regulation '
            'of natural gas produced as a by-product of oil production that is '
            'vented or flared. The Biden team hopes that 75% of all methane '
            'emissions will be covered.\n'
            'The other major sources of methane in the US are municipal '
            'landfills, thousands of abandoned oil wells and coal mines, and '
            'finally agriculture. New rules, due to be phased in, will require '
            'companies to oversee and inspect 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, '
            'including 300,000 miles (480,000km) of transmission lines and '
            '2.3m miles (3.7m km) of lines inside cities. In Boston alone it '
            'is estimated that 49,000 tonnes of methane leak each year. The '
            'administration says it is working in concert with the EU and is '
            'using a mix of incentives, new disclosure rules and regulation. '
            'It stressed that the plan will create thousands of unionised '
            'jobs.',

{'article': 'Covid restrictions are being stepped up in parliament, with MPs '
            'told to wear masks, tours of the building cancelled and some '
            'staff told to work from home. The move came after the UK Health '
            'Security Agency warned the risk of the virus transmitting between '
            'those who work in the Palace of Westminster had become “greater”. '
            'Social distancing has also been encouraged again “as far as '
            'possible” around the Commons, with committee rooms identified as '
            'one of the key areas where the virus is spreading. '
            'Non-parliamentary business such as banquets and receptions have '
            'also been cancelled for the next two weeks. New guidance issued '
            'on Tuesday stated that officials who “do not need to be on the '
            'estate are advised to work remotely”. It added that face-to-face '
            'meetings should be avoided as much as possible. Although the '
            'contingency measures to guard against further infections in '
            'parliament have been activated, the law as it applies to England '
            'remains that there is no requirement for people to follow social '
            'distancing or wear masks. While people have been advised to wear '
            'face coverings in crowded rooms for months, cabinet ministers and '
            'most Tory MPs continued to sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the '
            'Commons chamber maskless. That changed last week, when the prime '
            'minister, Boris Johnson, and other Conservatives wore a face '
            'covering during the budget, though three did not – including the '
            'Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw hit '
            'out at those MPs continuing not to wear a mask. He tweeted: “You '
            'get chucked out of parliament for not wearing a jacket and tie. '
            'If you won’t wear a mask – a recommended public health measure to '
            'protect others – nothing. What an antediluvian Alice in '
            'Wonderland this remains.”\n'
            'The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, urged MPs to do the “right thing”. He '
            'said: “If we can get through these two weeks, I believe we’re '
            'then through to next year … numbers have been rising on both '
            'sides of the House and within staff. Unusually, the transmission '
            'has been on the estate – and that’s why it’s a greater worry than '
            'we’ve had before.” However, the Tory MP Karl McCartney, praised '
            'an “excellent speech … about the usefulness of masks” by the the '
            'peer Viscount Ridley, who said last week that preventing aerosol '
            'transmission of Covid with masks was “like catching midges with a '
            'tennis net”. Another senior Conservative backbencher told the '
            'Guardian they were concerned that telling MPs to wear masks in '
            'parliament would create “the perception that there is one rule '

{'article': 'France backed down on its threats to clog up British trade and '
            'ban UK fishers from its ports after Jersey offered to speed up '
            'approval for “five or six” new fishing vessels in its waters. Ian '
            'Gorst, Jersey’s minister for external affairs, said the offer '
            'from his administration, which was mirrored by the UK government '
            'over an undisclosed number of boats, had proven to be a “good way '
            'to move things forward”. Paris had set a deadline of midnight on '
            'Monday by which it demanded further licences for its vessels in '
            'UK and Jersey’s coastal waters, only for Emmanuel Macron to '
            'announce he would shelve his government’s plans after last-ditch '
            'talks called by the European Commission. “It’s not while we’re '
            'negotiating that we’re going to impose sanctions,” the French '
            'president had told reporters in Glasgow, where he was attending '
            'Cop26. The boats expected to have their approval expedited, '
            'having been initially rejected, are replacements for old vessels '
            'that had a track record of having fished in the coastal waters of '
            'the UK and Jersey. Gorst said that as the talks had gone on in '
            'Paris, there also appeared to have been a realisation that '
            'triggering the threats would lead to “entrenched positions”. '
            '“There are some issues around replacement vessels that we can '
            'sort out earlier than we might have envisaged, that is for both '
            'us and the UK,” he said. “I think that would be quite a good way '
            'to move things forward and allow more time. Of the vessels that '
            'the EU is asking us to reconsider, at least a handful, about five '
            'or six, are replacement vessels … “The French have taken the view '
            'that it is better to try to deal with the individual vessels than '
            'trigger countermeasures whereby everybody will become '
            'entrenched.” Asked about the issue by reporters at the Cop26 '
            'summit, Boris Johnson indicated the UK had not changed its '
            'position and played down the issue’s importance. The prime said: '
            '“We are working very, very closely with our French friends and '
            'partners on the things that matter most to the people of the '
            'world, and that is tackling climate change and reducing CO2. “By '
            'comparison with that hugely important issue, the ones you '
            'mentioned are really vanishingly unimportant, but since you ask '
            'about whether the UK has changed its position on the fishing '
            'issue, the answer is no.” The French government has said that '
            'half of the vessels applying to fish in UK and Jersey waters have '
            'been rejected unfairly and in breach of the trade and cooperation '
            'agreement. The UK and Jersey have said they will issue licences '
            'only to boats that meet the test of being able to prove that they '
            'have previously operated in their coastal waters. Jersey has so '
            'far rejected 55 applicants, of which “five or six” are '
            'replacement boats. Gorst said his government was willing to '
            'examine any new evidence “boat by boat” for the rest after a '
            'request by the commission. French minister for the seas, Annick '
            'Girardin, told the National Assembly that France wanted clarity '
            'from the UK by Tuesday evening on how 14 vessels could secure '
            'licences in its waters. She also called for swift agreement on '
            'the issue of replacement boats and requested that Jersey agree to '
            'reconsider its position on a further 13 boats whose applications '
            'to fish in the Channel Island’s waters had been rejected. The row '
            'until now has been dominated by a dispute over the type of '
            'evidence that is acceptable, with France insistent that a set of '
            'data known as Sacrois, which provides a rough approximation of a '
            'vessel’s movements should be enough. Gorst said there appeared to '
            'be a “softening” from Paris on that point, however. Talks will '
            'continue between officials for the next 48 hours. The UK cabinet '
            'minister Lord Frost is to meet Clément Beaune, the French '
            'minister for European affairs, in Paris on Thursday. Gorst said '
            'the developments had created “breathing space” but admitted to '
            'concerns that relations could again turn sour if France was '
            'unable to offer extra evidence to secure permits beyond the '
            '“handful” of replacement vessels. “We have been here before,” he '
            'said. “What we would ask about that is, if they have not been '
            'able to provide evidence to date it would seem strange to say the '
            'least that they could provide evidence for the 55 in the course '
            'of the next three days. We believe the evidence has got to be '
            'provable.” Macron, who faces an election in six months’ time, is '
            'being urged across the political spectrum in France to take a '
            'tough line with the UK. “I’m all for giving it an extra 48 hours '
            'but we’ll have to be very tough indeed with the British at that '
            'point,” centre-right presidential candidate Xavier Bertrand told '
            'France 2 television. Earlier on Tuesday, UK environment '
            'secretary, George Eustice, had claimed France had retreated from '
            'threats of immediate measures because it “looked more closely at '
            'the evidence”. “We just very much welcome the fact that France '
            'has stepped back from that course of action. And of course we '
            'continue to have dialogue if there are additional vessels that '
            'qualify,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Gorst said his '
            'government supported the comments from the foreign secretary, Liz '
            'Truss, who had threatened tit-for-tat sanctions through the EU-UK '
            'trade and cooperation agreement against France if it imposed '
            'sanctions on UK and Jersey boats. A Downing Street spokesman said '
            'the talks taking place were on individual licence applications, '
            'rather than “the underlying approach”. “No new licences were '
            'issued to French vessels over recent days,” the spokesman added.',

{'article': 'In the war of words over fishing rights in the Channel, much '
            'attention has been paid to a single line in a leaked letter from '
            'Jean Castex, the French prime minister, to Ursula von der Leyen, '
            'president of the European commission. The nuances of the '
            'offending sentence vary in translation, but the gist is that '
            'European public opinion should be left in no doubt that there is '
            'more pain associated with leaving the European Union than staying '
            'in it. To the Eurosceptic ear, that was confirmation of a '
            'spiteful motive on the continent. France, it was alleged, wants '
            'to “punish” Britain for choosing freedom. Viewed from the other '
            'side, Castex was merely restating the obvious logic of Brexit: it '
            'is a repudiation of European solidarity and a bet on the '
            'advantages that a sole trader might gain in rivalry with a '
            'syndicate. The syndicate members have an interest in that gamble '
            'not paying off. British Eurosceptics are weirdly prickly about '
            'that banal strategic fact. It is simply the corollary of their '
            'own florid rhetoric down the years, denouncing Brussels as a '
            'parasite that saps national vitality and extolling Brexit as '
            'proof of EU obsolescence – the first step in a great unravelling. '
            'Self-evidently, the European project is bolstered if Boris '
            'Johnson is humbled, and vice versa. In the fisheries dispute, '
            'France deserves an ample portion of blame for cynical escalation. '
            'President Macron is sabre-rattling with an eye on his domestic '
            'audience ahead of elections next year. But his attitude is '
            'coloured by seething contempt for a British prime minister whom '
            'he sees as a stranger to probity. That feeling was much '
            'aggravated by the recent poaching of a lucrative defence contract '
            'to build Australian submarines as part of the Aukus security deal '
            'with Washington. But it is Johnson’s treatment of the Northern '
            'Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement – signing a '
            'treaty with no intention of implementing its terms – that '
            'convinced the French president that Downing Street had gone full '
            'rogue. The crisis in Northern Ireland is vastly more dangerous '
            'than a kerfuffle over cod. But they are symptoms of the same '
            'syndrome: a Brexit model that makes a sacred principle of '
            'sovereignty. All trace of EU institutional leverage must be '
            'scoured from the land and dredged from the sea. That fixation '
            'guarantees tension at every frontier where old, free-flowing '
            'habits are subject to the friction of new checks, forms and '
            'licences. The material gains from maximising sovereignty in this '
            'way are nil, while costs are mounting. But conceding that the '
            'model is flawed is unthinkable in Johnson’s Tory party. Or '
            'rather, unsayable. There are MPs who understand what has gone '
            'wrong but anticipate only ostracism if they were to speak out. '
            'That leads to two policy choices. First, exaggerate or invent '
            'fictional benefits from scrapping EU rules. Rishi Sunak dabbled '
            'in this with his budget speech last week, disingenuously '
            'presenting cuts to alcohol duty as a Brexit dividend. (Booze '
            'classifications will indeed diverge from European directives, but '
            'the accompanying price drops would still have been permitted.) '
            'Second, turn international rancour to domestic political '
            'advantage: cite cross-Channel disputes as proof of Brussels’ '
            'malevolence, then rebadge the economic pain intrinsic to Brexit '
            'as a vindictive backlash from the continent. Already this tactic '
            'is being rehearsed in Northern Ireland. What the EU calls '
            'implementation of a signed agreement, Eurosceptic hardliners '
            'denounce as a blockade. It is a feasible political strategy, '
            'albeit a nasty one. But it lacks one crucial element: the heroic '
            'destination. Throughout history, revolutionary movements have '
            'made excuses for their failures by blaming foreign sabotage. But '
            'they have also sustained momentum with visions of a utopian '
            'future. That was the Brexit method, too, for as long as EU '
            'membership could be made the scapegoat for a whole range of '
            'social and economic ills. Now the ills remain but the proposed '
            'remedy has already been taken. In that sense (and only that one) '
            'Brexit is a victim of its own success. Britain cannot get any '
            'further out of the EU. David Frost is scraping the sovereignty '
            'barrel. The Tory awkward squad that hounded David Cameron into a '
            'referendum, and then harried Theresa May out of office for '
            'seeking compromises with economic reality, got all they could '
            'have wanted from Johnson. They know their battle is won and are '
            'saddling different hobby horses, riding out to new fronts in the '
            'culture war, grumbling about the cost of cutting carbon emissions '
            'in the tone they once used for “Brussels’ red tape”. Johnson has '
            'tried to sustain the rhetoric of Brexit as sunlit upland. His '

{'article': 'Ethiopia has declared a state of emergency after forces from the '
            'northern region of Tigray said they were gaining territory and '
            'considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa. The declaration '
            'came as Joe Biden accused the government of “gross violations of '
            'internationally recognised human rights” and said he that he was '
            'removing Ethiopia from a key US trade program, clearing the way '
            'for further economic sanctions over its failure to end the nearly '
            'year-long conflict. Jeffrey Feltman, the US special envoy for the '
            'Horn of Africa, warned that the US would take further measures '
            'against the Abiy government within days rather than weeks if it '
            'does not end the conflict. He said “We can proceed down one path '
            'that inevitably leads to sanctions and other measures or we can '
            'go down another path where we can revitalise the partnership that '
            'started when prime minister [Abiy Ahmed] took office. The US '
            'wants the latter.” “Prolonging the war, dodging genuine '
            'negotiations to lead to de-escalation and a ceasefire, and '
            'refusing unhindered humanitarian access to avert catastrophe are '
            'actions that are taking Ethiopia [in] a dangerous direction,” he '
            'said. The announcement of the state of emergency came two days '
            'after the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, urged citizens to take up '
            'arms to defend themselves from the Tigray People’s Liberation '
            'Front (TPLF). Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told '
            'residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their '
            'neighbourhoods. The state of emergency was imposed after the TPLF '
            'claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it '
            'was considering marching on Addis Ababa, about 380km (235 miles) '
            'to the south of their forward positions.\n'
            'The city administration said people should register their weapons '
            'and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were '
            'being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said. '
            '“Residents can gather in their locality and safeguard their '
            'surroundings,” it said. “Those who have weapons but can’t take '
            'part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over '
            'the weapon to the government or their close relatives or '
            'friends.” The governments of four of the country’s 10 regions '
            'also called upon Ethiopians to mobilise to fight against the '
            'Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said. On Monday night, '
            'Tigrayan forces said they had linked up with fighters from an '
            'Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are '
            'Ethiopia’s biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders '
            'are currently in prison.\n'
            'The conflict in what was once considered a stable western ally in '
            'a volatile region has plunged about 400,000 people in Tigray into '
            'famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 '
            'million people in the north to flee their homes. Speaking in '
            'Washington, Feltman said the US was seeing signs of famine and '
            'near-famine and that it was mostly government restrictions that '
            'were preventing humanitarian help from getting to people. He '
            'said: “It is not too late to retrace our steps towards the path '
            'not taken but the change in direction must occur in days not '
            'weeks. It requires the Ethiopian government to take steps we have '
            'been raising for months’’. He said he was willing to travel at '
            'any time to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to mediate and '
            'secure a peace deal with the TPLF. Feltman said there were '
            '“credible and repeated stories of looting, displacement, '
            'executions, reports of rape and sexual violence as a tool of war” '
            'in which all factions were implicated to some degree. He said '
            'that the US will be encouraging “international justice and '
            'accountability against those responsible for the horrors they '
            'have imposed on the Ethiopian people”. He added “the Ethiopian '
            'people who have suffered are going to want to see some kind of '
            'justice and reckoning for the horrors they have been through due '
            'to this needless conflict.” The conflict started over the night '
            'of 3 November 2020, when forces loyal to the TPLF – including '
            'some soldiers – seized military bases in Tigray, a northern '
            'region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there. The TPLF had '
            'dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost '
            'much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 after years of '
            'anti-government protests. When he first came to power, Abiy '
            'enacted significant political reforms but rights groups say many '
            'of those freedoms have since been rolled back. He was awarded the '
            'Nobel peace prize in 2019 for ending a long-running border '
            'conflict with Eritrea. Troops from Eritrea, whose president is an '
            'arch-enemy of the TPLF, later entered Tigray to support Ethiopian '
            'forces.',

{'article': 'Jordan Henderson has cited Luis Suárez as a major influence on '
            'his development at Liverpool and believes the controversial '
            'striker deserves a warm reception at the end of his Anfield '
            'return with Atlético Madrid. The former Liverpool forward was '
            'jeered for his antics during Barcelona’s Champions League '
            'semi-final collapse in 2019, his first competitive appearance at '
            'Anfield since leaving five years earlier, and sparked a spat with '
            'Virgil van Dijk in a 10-minute cameo when the sides met in Madrid '
            'a fortnight ago. Henderson, however, insists that fiercely '
            'competitive edge benefited him and Liverpool during Suárez’s '
            'three and a half years with the club and the Uruguay '
            'international’s contribution should be recognised on Wednesday.\n'
            '“We all know he’s a top player, has been for a long time, who '
            'produced so many good moments at Liverpool,” the midfielder said. '
            '“I learned a lot from him while he was here. I’m quite close to '
            'him and still speak to him. Now and again I’ll call him to see '
            'how he is doing, how his family is doing and things like that. “I '
            'took a lot from him. He helped us a lot when he was at Liverpool '
            'with the mentality side of things – how he was in training, how '
            'he always wanted to win and how he played through pain barriers. '
            'He just wanted to get out and play football and try his best for '
            'the team. He helped me massively and made me grow in confidence '
            'as a player. I had a good relationship with him on the pitch but '
            'also off the pitch as well.”\n'
            'The Liverpool captain believes any appreciation for Suárez from '
            'the crowd should be reserved until after the game, although the '
            '34-year-old may not be overly concerned by his reception. “When '
            'Luis was here he was phenomenal for a number of years; he was '
            'outstanding,” Henderson said. “The fans know that and will '
            'appreciate what he did at this football club. I don’t think Luis '
            'will be too bothered [at the reception]. Maybe not during the '
            'game, but it would be nice after the game for him to get a nice '
            'reception from the crowd.” Liverpool were drawn in a Champions '
            'League group full of European pedigree but Jürgen Klopp’s team '
            'can qualify with two matches to spare with another victory. It '
            'would be the first time Liverpool have won their opening four '
            'games in a Champions League group and intensify the pressure on '
            'Diego Simeone’s side, who are level on four points with Porto. '
            'Fabinho and Thiago Alcântara are in contention after injuries.\n'
            'Klopp, who will be taking charge of his 50th Champions League '
            'game as Liverpool manager, said: “It would be big [to qualify '
            'early]. We usually have a final in the group but I hope that '
            'doesn’t happen this year. Of course we want to avoid that, but we '
            'can’t take the second step before the first step. We just have to '
            'win, and then afterwards we can talk about what kind of '
            'achievement that would be. “For the moment we have to prepare a '
            'football game against one of the best sides in the world, one of '
            'the best organised and one of the best motivated. They go for '
            'everything all the time. We play them now for the fifth time, '
            'including a [pre-season] tournament in Munich, so we know a lot '
            'about each other. There should not be a lot of surprises.”',

{'article': 'Joe Root fancies the shellacking England’s Twenty20 side handed '
            'out to Australia last Saturday has increased confidence before '
            'the Ashes campaign, even if the personnel, format and conditions '
            'will differ from the World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. '
            'England’s tour of Australia officially gets under way on Thursday '
            'when a squad of 13 red-ball specialists – including the recently '
            'added Ben Stokes – and 15 Lions players fly to Queensland to '
            'begin preparations for the five-match series that starts at the '
            'Gabba on 8 December. Of the five players set to join them after '
            'the World Cup – the final of which is on 14 November – four '
            'played in the eight-wicket group stage win against Australia, '
            'although only Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan appear certain starters '
            'in the Test side. Jonny Bairstow and Chris Woakes will push for '
            'spots, while Mark Wood, yet to feature in the UAE because of an '
            'ankle injury, will have to prove his fitness.\n'
            'Nevertheless, along with the significance of India winning in '
            'Australia this year, Root sees some relevance from a short-form '
            'victory over a team that included five Test regulars in David '
            'Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell '
            'Starc. “India proved to the rest of the world that Australia is '
            'not a place you can’t go and win,” Root said. “They took them on '
            'in their own way, they played to their strengths, but they didn’t '
            'take a backward step at any stage. It’s making sure we do the '
            'work now and we give ourselves that confidence. “And also '
            'probably try and lean on that confidence and performance the T20 '
            'side put in the other night. There will be guys from both teams '
            'involved in that series and you want to try and capture as much '
            'confidence as you can.” The start of the Ashes tour will be like '
            'no other before it. England’s players and a backroom staff '
            'initially led by Graham Thorpe are expected to touch down in '
            'Brisbane and then travel to a resort on the Gold Coast for a '
            'two-week quarantine period where they will spend the first three '
            'days isolating in hotel rooms.\n'
            'The enlarged squad will then be allowed time outside and begin '
            'training at the multipurpose Metricon Stadium in Carrara; once '
            'the fortnight is complete, further freedoms in line with local '
            'restrictions will follow, even if the focus will be on the two '
            'intra-squad matches that serve as their only warm-up cricket.\n'
            'A bubble of sorts will still be in place and mindful of the need '
            'to establish protocols on the ground and avoid any breaches, the '
            'England and Wales Cricket Board is understood to be flying out '
            'Steve Elworthy for the first month of the tour in what represents '
            'a final outing for the director of events before he takes up his '
            'new role as Surrey’s chief executive. Elworthy masterminded the '
            'ECB’s behind-closed-doors summer of 2020 and the bubbles that '
            'prevented any Covid-19 cases; as Root stressed on Tuesday after a '
            'training session at Loughborough, it is imperative the players '
            'remain respectful of the rules, even if bubble life is grating '
            'after 18 months. On England’s own experience of facing India '
            'during the summer, a series they finished 2-1 down but will not '
            'be decided until the rescheduled fifth Test next year, Root said: '
            '“There were a couple of occasions when games could have gone '
            'either way and India just grabbed it ahead of us. “We have to '
            'have the bit between our teeth and stand up at those key moments '
            'and say: ‘Right, we are going grab this game,’ and make sure that '
            'we are the ones in that tight moment who get across the line and '
            'get the win. It’s a great lesson for us all. “I’m very wary about '
            'commenting too much on Australia, I don’t think that’s the right '
            'approach for us. It’s never really been something that we’ve paid '
            'too much attention to.\n'
            '“We’ll do our research and make sure we’re very well prepared for '
            'what Australia are likely to throw at us, but ultimately we need '
            'to make sure our own house is in order, that we’re as ready as we '

{'article': 'It is being described as the “museum of the future”, with '
            'institutions across the world including London’s V&A set to '
            'follow the path pioneered by Rotterdam’s Boijmans Van Beuningen. '
            'From Saturday, in what is a world first, the King of the '
            'Netherlands, Willem-Alexander, will open the Depot, a bowl-shaped '
            'warehouse next to the Boijmans museum’s original 1930s building '
            'in which all 151,000 items in its revered collection, from the '
            'Van Goghs to its Magrittes and Dalís, will be on permanent '
            'display to the public. As is the case with major museums across '
            'the world, the Boijmans, first opened in 1849 to show of the '
            'collections of Frans Jacob Otto Boijmans and Daniël George van '
            'Beuningen, has for a long time only been able to display about 4% '
            'of its treasures in permanent and temporary exhibitions. But from '
            'this weekend, for €20, visitors – wearing protective coats and '
            'asked to restrict themselves to carrying a small bag for the '
            'purposes of security – will have the full gamut of the museum’s '
            'crown jewels to view across six floors.\n'
            'Those entering the 40-metre-high building, whose exterior is made '
            'up of soaring curved mirrors, will be able to watch the museum’s '
            'art restorers as they work, learn about the internal workings of '
            'the institution, and travel through five different microclimates '
            'made suitable for metal, plastic, paper, black and white and '
            'colour photography. The works, including more than 63,000 '
            'paintings, photographs, films, pre-industrial and design objects, '
            'contemporary art installations, sculptures and 88,000 prints and '
            'drawings, are being stored, organised and displayed on the basis '
            'of their size and conservation requirements rather than theme or '
            'artist. Due to the lack of curating one would expect within such '
            'a collection, it is hoped that there will be an element of '
            'discovery and adventure for those looking around. Objects are '
            'displayed on movable racks, or in display cases, efficiently '
            'packed in, with objects sensitive to light or heat kept in '
            'cabinets, only to be inspected on appointment. “You’ll go through '
            'the collection like you would visit a library looking for a book '
            'and finding three others,” said Sjarel Ex, the museum’s joint '
            'director. “We also decided to take private collectors, to give '
            'private collectors opportunities to work with us in the same '
            'building. So you see when you go around and you see the floors, '
            'you will meet with several collections that enjoy a collaboration '
            'with the museum.” Boijmans is setting a global trend, says Ina '
            'Klaassen, the museum’s second joint director. The Victoria and '
            'Albert Museum has been taking soundings from the Boijman over its '
            'plans for its own version, the Storehouse, in London’s Queen '
            'Elizabeth Olympic Park. “But we have had conversations with '
            'people from Korea, Stavanger, Norway, Singapore, they all came '
            'along, and yesterday there was a delegation from Qatar,” she '
            'added.\n'
            '“We did a symposium three months ago that was joined by over 200 '
            'colleagues in the world and with their staff,” said Ex. “It’s '
            'certainly a new typology, that all museums [are considering].” '
            'The idea had been first mooted in Rotterdam in 2004 as a solution '
            'to a typically Dutch problem: flooding. It has been an issue for '
            'decades and a major flood in the museum’s cellars, the old depot, '
            'in 2009 was followed by many more. The Boijmans was spending an '
            'increasing amount of money on external warehouses. “So we went to '
            'the city and said: ‘Well, we have this great idea. We think that '
            'we want to show more collection because the city actually owns '
            'the collection, well like 85%,’” said Klaassen. “They said: '
            '‘Well, that is interesting, but maybe you should start '
            'fundraising.’” The museum did so and has now ploughed €55m (£50m) '
            'into its “open storage” facility, thanks in large part to a €27m '
            'donation from the De Verre Bergen Foundation. Inconveniences '
            'along the way included having to send back the mirrored glass for '
            'the facade on arrival from China as it was deemed to be too '
            'brown. In a nod to the danger of water to art, the round '
            'building’s footprint is small, at just 40 metres, with a 10-metre '
            'overhang. The reflective facade is made up of 6,609 sq metres of '
            'glass, divided into 1,664 panels. Birches, grasses and pines '
            'planted on the building’s roof help retain rainwater, which is '
            'used throughout the building. Winy Maas, the building’s '
            'architect, described the Depot as a “Noah’s ark”. But, however '
            'impressive, the Depot is not an alternative to the main museum, '
            'under renovation and not due to reopen until 2028, says Klaassen. '
            '“That is a completely different story,” she said. “We can’t '
            'function without a museum. This is just the first stage of the '
            'museum of the future.”',

{'article': 'Morrisons supermarket group has apologised after it labelled a '
            'chicken product as containing British poultry and “non-EU salt '
            'and pepper”. The decision to detail the origin of the ingredients '
            'on its £4 oven-ready chicken crown prompted a threat of boycott '
            'from some customers. The company, which has long prided itself on '
            'the sale of British produce including “100% British fresh meat, '
            'milk and eggs”, immediately backtracked, telling customers the '
            'non-EU part of the label was a mistake. “The wording on the '
            'packaging is an error for which we apologise. We are changing the '
            'packaging immediately,” it tweeted.\n'
            'It is understood that the labelling was a result of a '
            '“misinterpretation of packing and labelling regulations”. After '
            'Brexit, label rules largely follow EU regulations – which state '
            'any food product marked British by flags or words must include a '
            'statement about the origin of any “primary” ingredients that are '
            'not British. In Morrisons’ case the name of the product included '
            'salt and pepper, so they are classed as “primary” elements and '
            'their provenance must be stated on the label in 75% of the size '
            'of the font used for the word “British”. The incident is the '
            'latest sign of a new front in the culture wars opening on '
            'supermarket shelves with some who agree with packaging that '
            'celebrates Britishness and others who do not. On Tuesday '
            'Morrisons said it was fully compliant with labelling rules but '
            'did not want to get drawn into Brexit culture wars. “Our chicken '
            'label is adhering to British packaging regulations, however we '
            'will be redesigning it to make it clear this is not a political '
            'commentary,” it said. One customer, David Bright, said: “I’m done '
            'with shopping @Morrisons … I can live with union flags on '
            'bananas, but the gratuitous slight on the EU is too much.” '
            'Another customer tweeted: “Have I missed this new trend for our '
            'groceries to celebrate their exclusion of any EU condiments?” '
            'Ghislaine Hull wondered why Morrisons made a point of advertising '
            'the fact the condiments it was using were both non-British and '
            'non-EU. “Aside from anything else I’d have thought most normal '
            'people want to know where foodstuff IS from not where it isn’t.” '
            'Others liked the label because it was divisive. “Have to say a '
            'very well done to Morrisons, this has upset all the right '
            'people.” The controversy comes as supermarkets navigate the '
            'meaning of post-Brexit Britain in labelling. A Crosse & Blackwell '
            'survey this year revealed more than half of British shoppers are '
            'looking to buy more domestic food. But some are put off by what '
            'they see as a politicisation of food, objecting to labels '
            'celebrating Britishness. One customer described the union flag on '
            'Mornflake porridge oats as “very unpleasant and quite '
            'intimidating”. And last summer Co-op supermarket was mocked in '
            'some quarters after it labelled a package of ice cubes as “made '
            'with British water”. “What next, British air?” quipped one '
            'customer on social media. “Brexit may be behind us now, but make '
            'no mistake: a divided country remains,” Callum Saunders, head of '
            'planning at Zeal Creative, which works with Nestlé, Pringles and '
            'McCain, told The Grocer earlier this year.',

{'article': 'There is a “chronic” lack of investment in primary school '
            'libraries in the UK, with teachers often forced to buy reading '
            'materials for children with their own money, according to a new '
            'study. But an alliance between the National Literacy Trust (NLT) '
            'and Penguin Random House UK (PRH) is setting out to transform '
            '1,000 school libraries, with organisers calling on the '
            'government, businesses and charities to back their efforts. '
            'Schools are not statutorily required to have a library on their '
            'premises, and the report, The Future of Primary School Libraries, '
            'reveals that four out of 10 have no dedicated library budget. '
            'Some respondents to the study said they were relying on donations '
            'from families or buying books from charity shops to stock their '
            'shelves. “Most teachers spend their own money adding to these '
            'resources, owing to lack of school funding,” said one. The lack '
            'has long been protested by authors, with current children’s '
            'laureate Cressida Cowell writing in April to Boris Johnson asking '
            'him to dedicate £100m a year to revitalising “deteriorating” '
            'primary school libraries across the country. According to the '
            'NLT, one in eight primary schools in England do not have a '
            'library, with the proportion climbing to one in four in schools '
            'with a higher proportion of pupils on free school meals. The NLT '
            'said that this is a sign of the “widening literacy attainment gap '
            'between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers”, which '
            'has been exacerbated by the disruption of Covid-19. The literacy '
            'charity has teamed up with PRH to call for large-scale public and '
            'private funding in order to equip 1,000 primary school libraries '
            'with training, new books and resources by 2025, supporting '
            '500,000 pupils over the next four years. The alliance is already '
            'backed by Arts Council England, which has awarded more than '
            '£900,000 through its National Lottery Project Grant programme to '
            'expand the World of Stories project, run by PRH and the NLT. PRH '
            'is investing more than £1m in additional support, and retail bank '
            'Chase has also pledged its support. World of Stories has already '
            'worked with 225 primary school libraries over the last three '
            'years.\n'
            '“One in 11 children on free school meals don’t own a single book '
            'of their own. With the latest research … it paints a very '
            'concerning picture of how these children and young people are '
            'able to access new books and unlock a lifetime of potential '
            'through reading. Together, we are committed to changing this,” '
            'said NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas. Pledging support for '
            'the initiative Alison Tarrant, chief executive of the School '
            'Library Association, said that school libraries are in desperate '
            'need of funding. “Primary school libraries are essential to '
            'children’s literacy and learning and yet the recent research '
            'continues to highlight disparity across the UK, impacting the '
            'development of reading and writing skills, wellbeing as well as '
            'overall academic attainment,” she said. Last week’s budget from '
            'chancellor Rishi Sunak promised large sums to “renovate, restore '
            'and revive” public libraries but none of that money will be '
            'allocated to schools. A Department for Education representative '
            'said: “Individual schools will decide how best to provide and '
            'maintain access to books for their pupils. To support schools in '
            'making sure children get the education they deserve, we are '
            'providing an additional £4.7bn in school funding by 2024-25, '
            'investment that will support teachers and resources such as '
            'library provision.”',

{'article': 'No 10 is likely to break its promise to increase the number of '
            'GPs in England by 6,000, Sajid Javid has admitted. The health '
            'secretary disclosed that the figure, a key promise in the '
            'Conservatives’ general election manifesto in 2019, was unlikely '
            'to be met given the number of GPs retiring early. He made the '
            'disclosure while giving evidence to the cross-party Commons '
            'health select committee. Asked by the committee chair, Jeremy '
            'Hunt, if the government was on track to implement the 6,000 '
            'pledge, Javid relied: “No. I’m not going to pretend that we’re on '
            'track when we are clearly not.” Increasing the number of GPs in '
            'England by 6,000 by 2025 was one of the commitments to improve '
            'the NHS Boris Johnson repeatedly made in the election campaign. '
            'Others included expanding the nursing workforce by 50,000 and '
            'offering 50m more GP appointments a year. Labour accused Javid of '
            'having “casually dropped” the pledge. “It is staggering that '
            'Javid has abandoned Boris Johnson’s key election promise to '
            'recruit 6,000 extra GPs”, said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow '
            'health secretary. “Patients struggling to get an appointment will '
            'be appalled that this promise has been so casually dropped.” The '
            'British Medical Association, which is at loggerheads with Javid '
            'over his plan to force GPs to see more patients face-to-face, '
            'said unmanageably heavy workloads were prompting growing numbers '
            'of experienced doctors to quit. “The latest workforce figures for '
            'England show that we have lost the equivalent of more than 1,800 '
            'full-time, fully qualified GPs since 2015, despite pledges to '
            'increase numbers by 6,000”, said Dr Richard Vautrey, the chair of '
            'the BMA’s GPs committee. “So while the health secretary’s '
            'admission today is long overdue, it is absolutely not news to GPs '
            'and their colleagues working in surgeries across the country that '
            'have been decimated by workforce shortages. “The bottom line is '
            'we are haemorrhaging doctors in general practice. While more '
            'younger doctors may be choosing to enter general practice, even '
            'more experienced GPs are leaving the profession or reducing their '
            'hours to manage unsustainable workloads.” He blamed the growing '
            'numbers taking early retirement on the government’s failure to '
            'include measures to relieve the pressure on GP surgeries in its '
            'recent plan to guarantee in-person consultations for patients who '
            'want one. “A failure to show any meaningful support for GPs or '
            'efforts to retain experienced doctors – something completely '
            'absent in the government’s recent ‘rescue plan’ that has been '
            'overwhelmingly rejected by the profession – ultimately impacts '
            'how easy it is for patients to access their GP practice.” Javid '
            'also: • Confirmed he is pressing ahead with plans, opposed by '
            'GPs, to publish details showing how many patients each surgery in '
            'England sees face-to-face. • Claimed that “a significant '
            'proportion of people are turning up for emergency care when they '
            'could have gone to their GP”. • Announced that NHS England would '
            'be publishing an “elective recovery plan” by the end of the month '
            'to tackle the 5.7m-strong backlog of operations. • Warned that '
            'the coming winter “will be extra tough” compared with normal. '
            'During the evidence session, Hunt recalled how, when he was '
            'health secretary, he had to break the promise he had made in 2015 '
            'to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020. He '
            'attributed that to the increasing number of doctors opting to go '
            'part-time or retire early. He cited the results of a BMA survey '
            'published in May, which found that more than a third of GPs '
            'planned to go part-time over the next year to reduce their '
            'workloads. Javid’s rowback on the pledge came as research showed '
            'that many GPs were cutting back on the amount of time they spent '
            'dealing directly with patients in order to protect their mental '
            'health. Exhausted GPs were displaying “resilience surface acting” '
            '– pretending to cope with work pressures better than they '
            'actually were – in order not to be seen as weak, the study found. '
            'GPs “appear to be resolving this issue by reducing their clinical '
            'working hours”, according to the findings, published online in '
            'the British Journal of General Practice on Tuesday. Warning of '
            'the “huge implications” of this trend, the authors added: “The '
            'cumulative effects of fewer mid-career GP hours worked, combined '
            'with increased retirement and reduced intake into the profession '
            'from newly qualified doctors, are potentially grave concerns for '
            'the stability of the overall GP workforce, the NHS and the health '
            'of the UK population as a whole.” The research was undertaken by '
            'Lucy Martin, a GP in the West Midlands, and Almuth McDowall, a '
            'professor of organisational psychology at Birkbeck, University of '
            'London. They based their findings on qualitative interviews with '
            '27 GPs about their resilience. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of '
            'the Royal College of GPs, said: “It isn’t surprising to hear that '
            'the government are not on track to keep their pledge of 6,000 '
            'more GPs by 2024. This has been clear for some time. But it is '
            'disappointing. The college has consistently been raising the '
            'alarm about the intense workload and workforce pressures facing '
            'general practice – and the impact it is having on patients – '
            'while the government focuses on ‘sticking plaster’ solutions to '
            'address them that do not address the fundamental challenges.”',

{'article': 'A major Melbourne hospital is down 51 staff who are refusing to '
            'be vaccinated against Covid, a requirement to work in Victorian '
            'healthcare facilities. The state government directive applies to '
            'all workers including contractors and those who are '
            'self-employed, and covers roles such as administration and retail '
            'staff within healthcare settings, doctors, nurses and people '
            'doing diagnostic imaging. The deadline for health workers to '
            'receive a first dose in Victoria was Friday 29 October. A Royal '
            'Melbourne hospital spokesperson said eight staff had chosen not '
            'to get vaccinated and had resigned, a further eight had their '
            'employment terminated after stating they would not get the jab, '
            'and another 35 staff had been stood down.\n'
            '“This is to allow them to potentially rethink their position and '
            'us, as an organisation, to go through the process that may '
            'potentially lead to further terminations of employment,” the '
            'spokesperson said. The 51 staff impacted represents just 0.45% of '
            'the hospital’s 11,000-strong workforce. They held a range of '
            'roles including nursing, administration, ward clerks and clinical '
            'positions – though none were doctors. A professor of epidemiology '
            'with the University of Sydney, Alexandra Martinuik, said the '
            'staff losses at the Royal Melbourne hospital were reasonable. “A '
            'kind gesture from the hospital could be to reach out to these '
            'staff to ask them if they have any questions about vaccination, '
            'or if there is anything more the hospital could do to help them '
            'choose immunisation,” she said. “But if these staff continue to '
            'choose not to be immunised then I do think it is reasonable for '
            'someone working in healthcare to resign, or be stood down if they '
            'are not Covid vaccinated and they don’t have a medical exemption, '
            'as it is much less safe for them and their patients and '
            'colleagues if not immunised.” Guardian Australia asked a number '
            'of major hospitals about the impact of the vaccine mandate in '
            'Victoria. The Royal Melbourne hospital was the only institution '
            'to provide a response. Sign up to receive an email with the top '

            'In New South Wales, the impact of the mandate on health worker '
            'numbers is being collated by the state’s health department. A NSW '
            'Health spokesperson said work was under way to reconcile data '
            'from across local health districts, networks and organisations. '
            '“With regard to the final number of people who may no longer work '
            'with NSW Health as they decided not to be vaccinated against '
            'Covid-19, this will become clear once this work is complete,” the '
            'department said. “This is because not all these people will '
            'resign due to their views, and each person’s particular '
            'circumstances need to be worked through by the local health '
            'districts and due process needs to be applied to all employees.” '
            'The data would be made available “in due course,” the '
            'spokesperson said. In early October, NSW Health said fewer than '
            '0.1% of its staff had resigned as a result of the Covid '
            'vaccination mandate, contradicting claims opposition to the jab '
            'could lead to staff shortages.\n'
            'On Monday, Queensland’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said more '
            'than 7,000 health staff were yet to confirm their vaccination '
            'status as required and about 4,000 were set to receive show-cause '
            'notices and be suspended on full pay. “We will put in place '
            'measures to manage any workforce shortages that might occur,” the '
            'minister said. Mandatory Coivd-19 vaccination for health workers '
            'is a move supported by the Australian Medical Association, with '
            'president Omar Khorshid saying legal protection should also be '
            'given to healthcare employers who mandate vaccinations. The AMA '
            'has welcomed mandatory health worker vaccinations in Victoria, '
            'NSW, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland but want a '
            'nationally consistent policy that applies to GPs and practice '
            'staff, pharmacists, hospital staff, ambulance staff, cooks and '
            'cleaners, with no exemptions except for legitimate medical '

{'article': 'Coalition MPs are split over the government’s revised religious '
            'discrimination bill, with the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, '
            'holding urgent meetings with MPs before parliament returns to try '
            'to resolve the issue. The push to introduce a bill in the final '
            'sitting fortnight this year comes almost three years after the '
            'prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised to introduce a new '
            'religious discrimination act after a review into religious '
            'freedom undertaken by Philip Ruddock in 2018. Cash, who took over '
            'the bill’s progress from Christian Porter when she became '
            'attorney general in March, is now consulting on a third iteration '
            'of the draft legislation in an attempt to overcome internal '
            'resistance and fulfil an election promise. Three issues are '
            'understood to face some resistance within the party room: the '
            'inclusion of a “Folau clause” that would give legal protection to '
            'someone expressing a statement of belief; conscientious objection '
            'provisions that would allow health practitioners to refuse to '
            'provide certain treatment; and the ability for religious '
            'institutions to discriminate against staff on the basis of '
            'religion to maintain a “faith-based ethos”.\n'
            'The Australian Christian Lobby has boasted it successfully '
            'pressured the government into including a Folau clause – a '
            'provision that would legally protect an individual from having '
            'their employment terminated as a result of them expressing their '
            'religious views. The issue gained prominence after footballer '
            'Israel Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia for social media posts '
            'suggesting homosexuals, adulterers, atheists and other “sinners” '
            'would go to hell. Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who attended one of a '
            'number of briefings with Cash this week, said he did not support '
            'the Folau clause. “I just have serious concerns about a number of '
            'issues in relation to it [the bill] and the Folau clause is a '
            'major concern,” Entsch told Guardian Australia. He said his '
            'position had not changed after previously indicating he would not '
            'support a bill that “reimposed” any discrimination through a '
            'religious discrimination act. Other MPs and senators, including '
            'Andrew Bragg, Dean Smith, Tim Wilson and Dave Sharma are '
            'understood to hold similar reservations.\n'
            'The third draft of the bill, which is still being finalised by '
            'Cash, comes more than two years after Porter released the '
            'government’s first exposure draft in early 2019. That bill, which '
            'was described as “friendless”, received almost 6,000 submissions '
            'during the consultation process and was later revised after the '
            'backlash. The government’s second exposure draft, designed to '
            'appease concerns of religious groups, was roundly criticised by '
            'the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australian Medical '
            'Association and LGBTQ+ groups. Conservative MPs, however, are '
            'pushing for the bill to be made a priority, warning that faith '
            'communities were expecting Morrison to deliver on the promise '
            'made before the last election. It is understood that WA senator '
            'Matt O’Sullivan spoke to the party room during the past sitting '
            'fortnight about the issue, questioning the government’s '
            'priorities after it signed off on a bill relating to the '
            'legalising of mitochondrial donation. Before the last election, '
            'Morrison penned a five-page letter to the heads of churches, '
            'promising to legislate a religious discrimination act as an '
            'election commitment. He said in the letter that he would '
            'introduce legislation “to make it unlawful to discriminate on the '
            'basis of a person’s religious belief or activity, including on '
            'the basis that a person does not hold any religious belief or '
            'does not engage in any religious activity”. Sign up to receive an '
            'email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'South Sydney Anglican Bishop Michael Stead would not comment on '
            'his discussions with the government on the legislation but said '
            'the bill was “well and truly overdue”. “It’s indefensible that '

            'party’s support of the bill. “We recognise that Covid has had an '

{'article': 'Australians trying to order goods could face a nightmare before '
            'Christmas, as shortages caused by blockages in global supply '
            'chains continue to bite. The pandemic has stretched supply chains '
            'to breaking point, which may make some goods scarce until 2023. '
            'Shoppers are still complaining of empty shelves, long after the '
            'toilet paper buying frenzies and personal protective equipment '
            'shortages of 2020. There are shortfalls of goods from medicines '
            'to coffee, to electronics and bicycles and clothes. Dan Murphy’s '
            'has said some alcohol products will be hard to source, and '
            'Australia Post has warned presents may not make it in time to go '
            'under the Christmas tree.\n'
            'There is no single reason for the shortages, but rather a '
            'combination of factors arising from the global disruption caused '
            'by the pandemic and local obstacles such as state border closures '
            'and industrial disputes on the wharves. The chief economist at '
            'the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Jarrod Ball, '
            'says there was a “massive shift of consumption” into goods over '
            'services during Australia’s lockdowns, as governments pumped out '
            'wage and benefit subsidies and restrictions prevented spending on '
            'travel and hospitality. But as demand for goods grew, the '
            'problems with supply got steadily worse. The chief executive of '
            'the Australian Retailers Association, Paul Zahra, says that has '
            'caused a nightmare for his members. “Our supply chains are under '
            'incredible pressure at the moment and there’s a myriad of issues '
            'at play here that are creating the perfect storm for retailers '
            'and consumers.” Where are the bottlenecks? Most of Australia’s '
            'imports come from China, followed by the US. As an island, '
            'Australia is particularly vulnerable to shipping delays, all the '
            'more so when the number of flights arriving in the country has '
            'been drastically curtailed. “At a global level, retailers are '
            'reporting that the capping of incoming flights has put '
            'significant pressure on shipping, and we are seeing container '
            'costs escalating up to four times their usual rate,” Zahra says. '
            'The price of shipping containers has exploded, as has the cost of '
            'chartering a ship to move things around the world, as the '
            'domestic spending boom on consumer goods in the US and the '
            'general disruption to pre-pandemic flows of containers has caused '
            'logjams of container ships in US ports, and shortages elsewhere. '
            'Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian '
            'Australia every morning\n'
            'When containers do arrive, they face more delays at Australia’s '
            'ports. The Maritime Union of Australia is locked in a battle over '
            'pay and conditions, with rolling strikes set to continue this '
            'month. Pallets, the wooden containers used to transport many '
            'items, are also suddenly undergoing a mismatch of supply and '
            'demand. “The pallets are a really good example of all these '
            'factors coming together in a way people might not have foreseen,” '
            'Ball says. “You’ve got a massive spike for consumer goods but at '
            'the same time a big lift in demand for timber due to lots of '
            'building and the renovations that are going on. “Add to that '
            'disruption to the factories that make the pallets, and that all '
            'adds up to a pallet shortage.”\n'
            'Covid itself continues to have a direct effect on crucial links '
            'in the chain. Distribution centres have been shut down, or staff '
            'forced to isolate, slowing the flow of goods. Australia Post has '
            'been overwhelmed at times during lockdown restrictions, and '
            'courier companies are also feeling the strain. “Some distribution '
            'centres and warehouses have been impacted by reduced staffing '
            'levels due to Covid cases, we’ve had industrial disputes from '
            'delivery drivers and port workers, while state border controls '
            'and limited domestic flights are also impacting the movement of '
            'goods,” Zahra says. Finally, there is a shortage of the right '
            'people for the right jobs. Infrastructure Australia warned in '
            'October that two in three key occupations necessary for '
            'construction were “likely or potentially in shortage”. There are '
            'nationwide shortages of engineers and architects, and potential '
            'shortages of bricklayers, concreters, carpenters, electricians '
            'and other tradies. Which products are worst affected? Cars and '
            'electronics The pandemic has increased demand as people buy more '
            'computer products to work from home or entertain themselves in '
            'lockdowns. But the global dearth of semiconductors used in '
            'electronics such as whitegoods, phones and cars means even Apple '
            'has struggled to get chips for iPhones, Macs and iPads. All '
            'computer manufacturers are facing similar difficulties. Toyota '
            'Australia says current demand exceeds supply, with long delays '
            'for parts. People are waiting months for some of its most popular '
            'models. Nissan, General Motors and Volkswagen are all facing '
            'delays. Food and groceries The Australian Food and Grocery '
            'Council has pulled together a taskforce to deal with supply '
            'problems, including the pallet crisis, which is hampering '
            'supermarkets shifting goods around the country. The council’s '
            'chief executive, Tanya Barden, says Covid staff shortages and '
            'shutdowns mean products have been kept in storage on pallets for '
            'longer. “The issues include impacts on global shipping and sector '
            'shutdowns based on health authority orders,” she says. She hopes '
            'that as states open up, pallets will be emptied and put back into '
            'distribution. “New measures for management of Covid close '
            'contacts in the workplace should also have beneficial flow-on '
            'effects to address pressures on labour capacity issues in supply '
            'chains.” Specific issues have further complicated the picture for '
            'other products, including coffee and some alcohol brands. '
            'Building materials Even before Covid, Australia was facing timber '
            'shortages because of the 2019-20 bushfires, which burned '
            'commercial plantations as well as native forests. Demand for '
            'construction materials skyrocketed during the pandemic as the '
            'federal government poured stimulus money into construction. That '
            'happened globally, too, so imports couldn’t make up the '
            'shortfall.\n'
            'Steel and other construction supplies are also in short supply. '
            'Steel mills around the world wound back production when Covid '
            'hit, expecting things would slow down, the Australian Steel '
            'Association chief, David Buchanan, has said. But then the '
            'stimulus money did what it was intended to do, and demand soared. '
            'The Australian Institute of Architects has warned that '
            'insulation, bricks and plaster board could also face shortages. '
            'When will it end? In July, the Productivity Commission warned '
            'that increasingly complex global supply chains meant they were '
            'more at risk from trade wars, natural disasters, financial '

{'article': 'Australia’s federal budget is set for a post-lockdown bounce '
            'before settling into deficits of $60bn a year due to higher '
            'social services and defence spending, an independent analysis has '
            'warned. Deloitte Access Economics’ budget monitor, released on '
            'Tuesday, projects cumulative deficits will be $45bn lower than '
            'expected over the next four years as momentum built before the '
            'Delta wave is unleashed through a sustained recovery in a highly '
            'vaccinated society. But in 2024-25 the deficit will be at least '
            '$36bn on announced policies and it’s tipped to reach $60bn '
            'including $25bn of new spending not yet announced.\n'
            'The federal government will then have an “ongoing shortfall” so '
            'large it would require interventions as drastic as raising the '
            'GST to 17% or raising marginal income tax rates by 5.5% to wipe '
            'out the deficit. The report calls into question the '
            'sustainability of stage three income tax cuts – which flatten the '
            'tax rate to 30% for all workers earning between $45,000 and '
            '$200,000 – supported by both the Coalition and Labor. Deloitte '
            'forecasts the budget deficit will shrink from $116bn in 2021-22 '
            'to $49bn in 2024-25 because “when nations get sufficiently ahead '
            'of Covid for their economies to open up, their tax revenues go on '
            'a tear”. In the medium and long term, Australia’s budget will be '
            'in deficit – not because of Covid spending measures, as the cost '
            'of servicing Australia’s debt actually decreased due to low '
            'interest rates – but due to baked-in spending. The May budget '
            'added $15bn a year to ongoing spending on social services, with '
            'large investments in disability, mental health and aged care, in '
            'part to rectify historical underspending identified by the royal '
            'commission. Deloitte warned of “a fast widening gap between what '
            'experts expect the NDIS to cost and what’s budgeted for it”, a '
            'gap also noted by the government services minister, Linda '
            'Reynolds, who has suggested “hard discussions” will be needed to '
            'make the scheme sustainable. The fastest-growing budget item, '
            'defence, is expected to continue to grow as the Aukus pact '
            'responds to dangers in the Indo-Pacific region with higher '
            'spending. Australia will also have almost one million fewer '
            'people due to Covid border closures, Deloitte projected, which '
            'will weigh on the budget. Deloitte warned that income tax cuts to '
            'battle bracket creep are “overdelivering” because “bracket creep '
            'is driven by wage growth, but that’s slumped to record lows”. '
            '“Worse still, the national debate on these tax cuts focussed on '
            'fairness, whereas the problem with these tax cuts was always '
            'their size,” it said. “So just when we should be turning our '
            'minds to how to pay for higher social and defence spending, we’ll '
            'deliver a tax cut that’s too big.” Sign up to receive an email '

            'Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson told Guardian '
            'Australia that the nation didn’t “need fiscal repair any time '
            'soon” because the top priority was to “repair the economy”. '
            'Richardson said stage three tax cuts, set to take effect in '
            '2024-25, and how to finance the deficit if they proceeded, were '
            '“the story of the next election”. “Do not let either side of '
            'politics hide from the difficult questions … there are no easy '
            'answers … important decisions need to be made and they won’t be '
            'fun.” There is disquiet within the Morrison government’s own '
            'ranks about the size of programs to combat the Covid recession '
            'including the $90bn jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, which Deloitte '
            'said could have been better targeted but played a “starring role” '
            'in supporting the economy. In September 2020 the treasurer, Josh '
            'Frydenberg, signalled the Coalition will continue to prioritise '
            'reducing the unemployment rate ahead of debt reduction, promising '
            'that it will not begin the work of substantial debt and deficit '
            'reduction until the unemployment rate was “comfortably” back '
            'under 6%.\n'
            'Labor, burned at the 2019 election for proposing wide-ranging tax '
            'changes to franking credits, negative gearing and capital gains '
            'tax has ditched all these revenue-raising measures and promised '
            'not to scrap the stage three tax cuts. Frydenberg said the '
            'monitor was “a further vote of confidence in Australia’s economic '
            'resilience” and showed “temporary, targeted and proportionate '
            'economic support has underpinned our strong economic recovery”. '
            '“Lower taxes and investment in skills and infrastructure will '
            'continue to support the economy as we recover from the biggest '
            'economic shock since the Great Depression,” the treasurer said. '
            'Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the budget monitor '
            '“confirms the significant challenges Australians face” and that '
            'improvements in the near term were “despite the Morrison '
            'government not because of it”. “This government has promised '
            'eight surpluses but delivered none, real wages are going '
            'backwards, and year after year its budgets have been weighed down '
            'by waste and riddled with rorts,” he said.',

{'article': 'Four Pacific-facing Latin American nations have committed to '
            'joining their marine reserves to form one interconnected area, '
            'creating one of the world’s richest pockets of ocean '
            'biodiversity. Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica announced '
            'on Tuesday the creation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine '
            'Corridor (CMAR) initiative, which would both join and increase '
            'the size of their protected territorial waters to create a '
            'fishing-free corridor covering more than 500,000 sq km (200,000 '
            'sq miles) in one of the world’s most important migratory routes '
            'for sea turtles, whales, sharks and rays. The move comes amid '
            'growing clamour for action to protect rare marine species and '
            'commercial fish populations against foreign fishing fleets '
            'exploiting the region’s rich marine biodiversity, as well as to '
            'limit illegal, under-reported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by '
            'local fishing communities. The president of Colombia, Iván Duque, '
            'announced an additional 160,000 sq km of marine protected area on '
            'top of the country’s existing 120,000 sq km at Cop26 in Glasgow '
            'on Tuesday. The day before, Ecuador’s president, Guillermo Lasso, '
            'took the first step by announcing the expansion of the current '
            '133,000 sq km Galápagos marine reserve by 60,000 sq km.\n'
            '“Just as all the world leaders here have called for action not '
            'words, I believe this is a concrete action on behalf of Ecuador '
            'that goes beyond any words we can say here,” Lasso told the '
            'Guardian after the announcement. “This is a sovereign decision of '
            'the Ecuadorian government but I have to point out that it is the '
            'result of five months of dialogue, which we’ve held with '
            'small-scale and industrial fishermen. For that reason I don’t '
            'expect any problem of rejection or protest because it is a '
            'consensual decision,” he said. Lasso added that the plan for a '
            'wider joined-up reserve was “an absolutely direct response of '
            'middle-income countries with a commitment to humanity” to the '
            'increased presence of industrial fishing fleets. He said the '
            'expansion involved one of the world’s largest debt swaps for '
            'conservation, but did not give any details or figures. The '
            'expansion creates a “safe swimway” connecting Ecuadorian with '
            'Costa Rican waters, where “important endangered migratory '
            'species, such as sharks, whales, turtles and manta rays travel”, '
            'said Ecuador’s environment minister, Gustavo Manrique. “In spite '
            'of the fact we’re a developing country, despite the fact we have '
            '[one of] the largest [fishing] fleets in the Pacific, we have '
            'decided to reduce the fishing effort,” Manrique told the '
            'Guardian.\n'
            '“This is the new language of global conservation. Never have '
            'countries with connecting maritime borders joined together to '
            'create a public policy.” This new Galápagos protected area would '
            'be split into two: a no-take zone of 30,000 sq km to the '
            'north-east of the Galápagos Islands connecting Ecuador’s waters '
            'with those of Costa Rica, along the underwater seamounts of the '
            'Cocos Ridge, a key migration route for ocean-going species. '
            'Another 30,000 sq km area is a no-longline fishing zone wrapping '
            'north-west around the existing Galápagos marine reserve. Alex '
            'Hearn, a British marine biologist who has worked in the Galápagos '
            'Islands for two decades, said it was a step forward. “This is a '
            'moment to relish, but there’s a lot of work which needs to be '
            'done.” Hearn said the eastern tropical Pacific was “one of the '
            'last bastions of what ocean biodiversity would look like in a '
            'pristine world”, and described the seas that connect the '
            'Galápagos, Malpelo, Cocos and Coiba islands as a living '
            'laboratory for scientific research. “Just protecting the waters '
            'around them is not enough. There’s a connectivity between the '
            'areas and that’s what we need to protect,” he said.\n'
            'Hearn noted that the populations of highly migratory species had '
            'been falling this century, among them turtles, rays and sharks, '
            'particularly the critically endangered hammerhead species that '
            'congregates to breed around the Galápagos’s Darwin and Colombia’s '
            'Malpelo islands. In June, as part of the UK-led “30x30” '
            'initiative to secure at least 30% of the world’s ocean as '
            'protected marine areas by 2030, Panama more than quadrupled the '
            'Cordillera de Coiba marine protected area – from about 17,220 sq '
            'km to 98,230 sq km. Max Bello, an ocean policy advisor with the '
            'NGO Mission Blue, said: “With this commitment, Latin America '
            'again consolidates its leadership in marine conservation, but '
            'more is needed. We are hoping to continue towards at least 30% of '
            'protection in all of the [maritime] countries.” “A new era – to '
            'provide protection to species which know no frontiers – has been '
            'born,” he said.',

            'doesn’t generate money.” Henry, 44, currently an assistant coach '
            'for the Belgian national team, said previous attempts to talk to '
            'social media firms had met with silence before his boycott. “I '
            'tried to reach [out] at times. They didn’t want to talk, but when '
            'the boycott happened they wanted to talk to me. I was like: ‘I '
            'don’t know what we need to talk about now’.” Henry said social '
            'media companies had not done enough since launching his boycott, '
            'which he said he would end once platforms started tackling racism '
            'and bullying properly. Speaking at a press conference after his '
            'Web Summit appearance, Henry said there had been no action. “They '
            'are not really trying to change anything about it.” Asked if he '
            'would return to social media, he said: “I am OK without it. I '
            'sleep well.” Henry also welcomed Monday’s report in the Times '
            'that online trolls could face a two-year jail sentence for '
            'posting content or sending messages that caused psychological '
            'harm. The criminal clauses would be included in the online safety '
            'bill, which Boris Johnson has promised to fast-track through '
            'parliament. Asked if he would support two-year sentences, Henry '
            'said: “Yes I would. I think that’s a big and massive start.” He '
            'said people shouting abuse in the street would be arrested or '
            'told to stop by police, but online “it seems you can do whatever '
            'you want”. Referring to the speed at which videos are removed '
            'from sites for breaching copyright, Henry added that social media '
            'companies would act if something had an “impact on their '
            'pockets”. Speaking in support of Puma’s Game of Our Lives '
            'anti-online hate initiative, he also expressed scepticism that '
            'Instagram would deal with complaints by Wilfried Zaha, the '
            'Crystal Palace forward, over abuse he received after his team '
            'defeated Manchester City at the weekend. Zaha has been told by '
            'Instagram to report each instance of abuse after the game. Henry '
            'said: “You need to report it for each [abusive] message – if they '
            'do answer.” A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of '
            'Facebook and Instagram, said: “No one should have to experience '
            'racist abuse anywhere, and we don’t want it on our platforms. We '
            'remove hateful content as soon as we find it and respond quickly '
            'to valid legal requests to help with police investigations.” It '
            'is also understood that Instagram has banned all the accounts '
            'that sent abuse to Zaha. Nick Clegg, the vice-president of global '
            'affairs at Meta, used his Web Summit appearance to defend the '
            'business against renewed criticism from the whistleblower Frances '
            'Haugen, who spoke in Lisbon on Monday. Clegg denied Haugen’s '
            'claims that Facebook deliberately “spoonfeeds” hateful content to '
            'keep them on the platform. Clegg said advertisers, who account '
            'for most of Meta’s $86bn (£63bn) annual revenues, did not want '
            'their ads placed next to extreme content. “It misreads the '
            'commercial self-interest of Meta,” he said.',

{'article': 'Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City may be in the “best '
            'moment” of his five years as manager, despite defeat in the past '
            'two matches by West Ham and Crystal Palace. The reverse at West '
            'Ham was in the Carabao Cup via a penalty shootout but Palace won '
            '2-0 in the Premier League with a convincing display when City '
            'were reduced to 10 men and decidedly second-best. Guardiola said '
            'he was content before his side host Club Brugge in Wednesday’s '
            'Champions League group game. “We are playing at an incredible '
            'level – the way we have been playing in the last month, month and '
            'a half,” he said.\n'
            '“I would say one of the best moments, maybe the best moment since '
            'we’ve been here. The results are many things, circumstances, and '
            'we have to improve. Our solidity, in terms of the process, we are '
            'doing really, really well.” Guardiola denied any frustration that '
            'results have not recently matched quality. “Football is a game '
            'where you win and lose. I’m only concerned about the way we play. '
            'Defeat was tough but we know the calendar, how busy it is. We '
            'want to finish this run well with the [Manchester] United game '
            '[on Saturday] before the international break.” City beat Brugge '
            '5-1 two weeks ago and are second in Group A, a point behind Paris '
            'Saint-Germain and two ahead of the Belgian club. “This is more '
            'important than United – this game gives us an incredible '
            'possibility to make a step forward to qualify for the last 16,” '
            'Guardiola said. “In the Premier League there are many games; in '
            'this competition just six [in the group] and now three left: they '
            'are decisive, three and four – the most important games.” Despite '
            'stating City are in their best moment, Guardiola found fault when '
            'reviewing the win at Brugge. “Some things we have to improve: '
            'defensively, our pressing, it’s normal, every game,” he said. “I '
            'saw the game against Brugge and saw many bad things we have '
            'done.”\n'
            'Kyle Walker, who played in the match, said the squad might '
            'discover later on Tuesday what the manager meant. “We will have '
            'to wait for today’s training session and find out,” the said. “He '
            'has probably been doing his homework and picked up on something '
            'to help the team.” Walker is confident Jack Grealish, who cost a '
            'British record £100m will find his best form, having scored twice '
            'and made three assists in 14 appearances. “I can assure you he is '
            'a nightmare for defenders,” Walker said. “He has not played '
            'badly, he’s probably not quite hit the assists and goal levels he '
            'was getting at Aston Villa, but we like to share the load here.”',

{'article': 'Nicolas Sarkozy has appeared in court as the first former French '
            'president to be ordered to testify as a witness – but refused '
            'point blank to answer any questions. “It is an essential '
            'principle of democracies known as the separation of powers, and '
            'as president of the Republic I do not have to account for the '
            'organisation of my office or the way in which I exercised my '
            'mandate,” he told the court in Paris on Tuesday. France’s '
            'president from 2007 to 2012 told the court that the order, which '
            'the judge said was necessary “to determine the truth” since '
            'Sarkozy had probably “influenced the acts of which the defendants '
            'are accused”, was “entirely anti-constitutional”. Sarkozy said he '
            'was accountable “to the French people, not to a court”. He has '
            'not been charged or interrogated in the case, in which five of '
            'his former aides and allies are accused of misusing public funds '
            'on polling contracts. The former head of state had said earlier '
            'he would refuse to testify in the trial, but told the court he '
            'had reconsidered because he “respected and have always respected” '
            'the judicial system, even if he considered the order to testify '
            '“totally disproportionate”. Sarkozy then exercised his right not '
            'to answer a lengthy series of questions from the judge and a '
            'lawyer for Anticor, the anti-corruption association that brought '
            'the case. Both the public prosecutor and the defence team '
            'declined to ask him anything. Five aides and allies of Sarkozy, '
            'including his former chief of staff Claude Guéant and ex-adviser '
            'and consultant Patrick Buisson, have been on trial since 18 '
            'October accused of favouritism, conspiracy and misuse of public '
            'funds. Prosecutors say the polling contracts, worth €7.5m '
            '(£6.4m), signed by the five during Sarkozy’s term in office were '
            'negotiated in secret and without competition, breaking French '
            'laws on transparency and competitive bidding in public contracts. '
            'Sarkozy, 66, no longer has immunity from legal prosecution and is '
            'embroiled in several cases. In September, a judge handed him a '
            'one-year prison sentence over the illegal financing of his failed '
            '2012 re-election bid. In March, he was convicted of “corruption '
            'and influence peddling” and given a three-year prison sentence, '
            'two years suspended, for trying to bribe a senior judge in one of '
            'several legal cases involving him. He is appealing against both '
            'verdicts. In October last year, he was placed under formal '
            'investigation on an accusation of “criminal association” over '
            'allegations the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi helped finance '
            'his successful 2007 presidential campaign to the tune of up to '
            '€50m. He has denied the allegations. He was cleared of '
            'involvement in another 2007 campaign financing scandal involving '
            'allies from his UMP party who were accused of accepting illegal '
            'payments from L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt in cash-filled '

{'article': 'Just before lift-off, I’m asked if I’ve ever done anything like '
            'this before. Following a nervous shake of my head, the news is '
            'broken that it “might feel quite unnatural”, but that we would be '
            'taking it slow. “Are you ready?” aerial director Gwen Hales asks. '
            'Soon I can feel empty space beneath my feet. Even though I am not '
            'afraid of heights, I’m suddenly very aware that I am dangling '
            'mid-air. This flying lesson feels more secure than I’d imagined '
            'but my heart still starts to beat faster. “A lot of people do '
            'have a very physical reaction, a bit like a panic attack, when '
            'they are taken up,” says Hales. We are at the rehearsal studios '
            'for an adaptation of CS Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch and the '
            'Wardrobe, which has just started a tour of the UK. The show was '
            'first staged at Leeds Playhouse in 2017 and transferred to the '
            'Bridge theatre in London in 2019. Hales was originally a circus '
            'performer: for 20 years she specialised as an aerialist, and then '
            'began directing when her body “started to crumble”. I’m attached '
            'to a harness that is tightened around my hips, that works by '
            'being clipped on to two metal wires connected to an electrical '
            'system. The instructions given are to let the machinery take me '
            'into the air. “Try not to fight it,” Hales says. But even with '
            'the mechanics pulling me upwards, my immediate reaction is to '
            'resist and stay on the ground.\n'
            'To fly, you need strong core muscles. “Anyone can be lifted, but '
            'doing choreography needs physical strength,” explains Hales. '
            'Before rehearsals start, she sends actors a training plan, mainly '
            'involving exercises such as planks. “If they haven’t done them, '
            'you can really tell,” she says. And my own lack of preparation '
            'makes following some of her directions difficult – such as lying '
            'flat. When performing aerially, the ability to stay horizontal is '
            'vital. “You don’t see a lot of people flying upright, so we have '
            'to do a lot of work to get it right,” says Hales. From a standing '
            'position, she instructs me to tip myself so I’m downwards facing. '
            'I’m told to stretch out my arms and balance myself while working '
            'hard to remain level. “You won’t fall out of the harness,” she '
            'says. But, as I wobble and slip just a little bit too far '
            'forward, I can’t help but worry. For Robyn Sinclair, the actor '
            'playing Susan, it is her first time properly flying on stage. '
            'Though she describes the feeling as a “fizzy excitement”, she '
            'tells me she initially felt nervous when she was lifted high up. '
            '“It was frightening. I don’t think I’m a natural. It takes me a '
            'long time to get used to being at a particular height. But once '
            'you do, it is a very powerful feeling.” As Susan, Sinclair only '
            'flies once in the show, in a scene when Aslan takes her and her '
            'sister Lucy on a journey through the skies of Narnia, but it is a '
            'moment she looks forward to performing. “I’m playing a human '
            'character, so luckily, I get to act shocked, which makes it '
            'easier!”\n'
            'Flying is one of the tools used in this production to evoke the '
            'Narnia universe, in addition to puppetry and live music. The tour '
            'is directed by Michael Fentiman, based on the original production '
            'by Sally Cookson, with set and costumes designed by Rae Smith. '
            'Fantasy is the reason we return to the tale again and again, says '
            'Samantha Womack, the former EastEnders actor who is playing the '
            'White Witch. “The narrative makes your imagination soar,” she '
            'says. “Even as adults, people need to experience magic.” Womack '
            'argues that Lewis’s story has taken on an even greater relevance '
            'during the pandemic. “The last year has been heavy. People have '
            'lost their sense of self and have struggled to understand what it '
            'means to have their freedom taken away,” she says. “This story is '
            'all about what matters [in life]. It’s a good time to escape the '
            'real world for a bit – and the flying adds excitement.” My time '
            'in the air was, unexpectedly, very moving. Hales tells me this '
            'feeling is something she hopes the audience will share. “I like '
            'to believe we’re physically connected to the people we watch on '
            'stage, so when we see them lifted, our bodies understand the '
            'sensation.” Theatrical flight demands that we suspend our belief '
            'in reality for a while, and, as I’m lowered on to the ground for '
            'the final time, I’m reluctant to say goodbye to my spell in the '
            'sky. “How did it feel?” Hales asks. “Superhuman,” I reply. The '
            'Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is on a UK tour until 9 April.',

{'article': 'ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER SPURS MANAGER Antonio Conte has enjoyed '
            'consistent success throughout his managerial career, winning the '
            'title at his last three clubs, Juventus, Chelsea and '
            'Internazionale. All good things must come to an end, though, and '
            'on Tuesday he was named as the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur. '
            'Presumably the 52-year-old Spaniard Italian is an ardent believer '
            'in the rule of three, or has come to the conclusion that his next '
            'championship will be more satisfying in pure narrative terms if '
            'the main character suffers a setback and has to overcome severe '
            'difficulties along the way. Either way, it’s a clean snap. But '
            'does this reduce Spurs to little more than the status of a '
            'MacGuffin? Not sure. Erm. Maybe. Perhaps. Surely not, though. '
            'Merriam-Webster defines a MacGuffin as “an object in a story that '
            'serves to set and keep the plot in motion despite usually lacking '
            'intrinsic importance”. Oh Spurs. “I am extremely happy to return '
            'to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the '
            'ambition to be a protagonist again,” cheered Conte, framing the '
            'news firmly in the context of his own journey, although to be '
            'fair at one point he almost allowed the sides of his mouth to '
            'turn upwards and form the semblance of a smile, as he posed with '
            'the shirt of the club whose name he couldn’t bring himself to '
            'say.\n'
            'Conte had, you’ll remember, told the North London MacGuffins to '
            'do one in the summer, sparking a chain of non-events that led to '
            'the Nuno fiasco and all the way back here. Conte explained away '
            'his volte-face with typical Italian romanticism. “Our union did '
            'not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was '
            'still too recent and emotionally too involved,” he extemporised, '
            '“but the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy '
            'in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. '
            'Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it '
            'with great conviction.” The Fiver wishes him the best of luck, '
            'and if he can convince Harry Kane to start running around again '
            'with similar determination, expect Tottenham to climb a few '

            'of fans was not simply a product of discontent with a manager’s '
            'decision. The chairman, Daniel Levy, is reported to have been '
            'furious after the game. As a Spurs fan, he had every right to be. '
            'But was the fury also based on the chants of “We want Levy out” '
            'that followed the opprobrium directed at Nuno?\n'
            'Whatever prompted the decision to sack the 14th manager of Enic’s '
            'reign as owner, the club’s board are firmly in the spotlight. '
            'Nuno lasted 17 games, an appointment made after a bungled and '
            'highly public flick through a Rolodex of managerial names that '
            'filled no one – probably not even Nuno – with confidence. It was '
            'an appointment that had to be got right, made after the failure '
            'of the last appointment that had to be got right. And has led to '
            'another appointment that has to be got right. There is open '
            'discussion now about whether the board are able to recognise the '
            'mistakes made or know how to put them right. But in the absence '
            'of any takers, this is the board we have. So we need them to get '
            'it right. Our role as a Supporters’ Trust is to help ensure the '
            'club achieves the best it can and we have to work with what we '
            'have to do that. We’ve been criticised by a small section of fans '
            'for not organising protests, but we exist to find solutions, not '
            'just take an oppositionist stance to please the gallery. Last '
            'Saturday’s expression of anger was all the more powerful for '
            'being spontaneous and unorganised. Fans don’t need to be told '
            'what to think or given permission to protest. But they would like '
            'to know the answers to the questions we’ve put to the board '
            'regularly over the past two years and that we set out again last '
            'month. None of those questions are unreasonable, none differ from '
            'the type that would be asked of any board or business in similar '
            'circumstances. Bland and evasive answers about focusing on '
            'success and being a family don’t cut it, especially when the club '
            'posts a statement urging everyone to stick together one day and '
            'sacks the manager the next.\n'
            'Antonio Conte needs to be able to assert some leadership, create '
            'some direction and identity, and be backed. There’s an air around '
            'Spurs that suggests everyone is looking over their shoulder, '

            'sterile luxury: glass-walled, penthouse restaurants and gleaming, '
            'first-class lounges. The film was shot in the Taiwanese capital '

{'article': 'The UK’s age-old “frenemy” relationship with France never fails '
            'to ignite passion, and no more so than when the frequent fishing '
            'wars are thrown into the mix. Post-Brexit, there is undoubtedly '
            'added piquancy to the cross-Channel insults. “After le showdown, '
            'now it’s LE SURRENDER”, trumpeted the Daily Mail, after France '
            'retreated from threats to clog up exports and ban UK fishers from '
            'landing catches on its coast in the latest row over licences. '
            'Other tabloid headlines evoked similar sentiment – “Le Surrender” '
            '(Metro); “Le Climbdown” (Express). From the hundred years war of '
            'the late middle ages through to the 19th-century Napoleonic wars, '
            'beyond the signing of the entente cordiale in 1904 and to the '
            'present fishing dispute, the UK’s relationship with France has '
            'had its rocky moments. The most recent “fishing wars” have '
            'provided an excuse for metaphors, and columns revisiting the '
            'Allies’ second world war liberation of France, to be dusted down '
            'and re-employed as they always are in Britain’s spats with its '
            'near neighbour – with French-baiting Franglais an irresistible '
            'element. “Clambusters”, railed he Sun, neatly melding the second '
            'world war and seafood, after Jean Castex, the French prime '
            'minister, wrote to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission '
            'president, last week saying the UK should be shown it caused more '
            'harm to leave the EU than to remain. More conflict imagery was '
            'dispensed by Clément Beaune, France’s Europe minister, after the '
            'Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan was seized '
            'in Le Havre. “Now we need to speak the language of force,” Beaune '
            'told French television. “Unfortunately, it’s the only language '
            'the British government understands.” The impounding of the '
            'British vessel was a dream for headline writers. “Done like a '
            'S-kipper,” said the Sun. “Ship’s hit fan,” shouted the Daily '
            'Star. “Go on Macron, blow up that boat and shock us out of our '
            'shellfish behaviour,” ran one Sunday Times article. Others urged '
            'the EU to “Tell Macron to sling his hook” and to “reel in '
            'maverick Macron”. Boris Johnson, who greeted France’s fury over a '
            'new AUKUS military pact between the UK, US and Australia with the '
            'Franglais “donnez-moi un break”, has also been unable to resist '
            'the odd pun. “We have bigger fish to fry,” he said, in a lame '
            'joke ahead of meeting the French president at the recent G20 and '
            'ongoing Cop26. Fish puns were much in evidence as recently as '
            'May. “Fish and ships: UK flexes its mussels,” is how the Sun '
            'reported Johnson’s deployment of gunboat diplomacy by dispatching '
            'two Royal Navy patrol vessels to Jersey after French trawlers '
            'threatened to blockade the port of St Helier. This dispute is the '
            'latest in a long line with France over fishing, including the '
            'Great Scallop War, or guerre de la coquille, which in October '
            '2012 led to a confrontation between French and British vessels '
            'off Le Havre over a difference in fishing restrictions. A second '
            'Scallop War in 2018 involved fishing boats colliding and '
            'projectiles being hurled. For now, though, France has '
            'de-escalated. Or, as the Sun put it: “They blink – it’s trawl '

            'erosion of free speech and the degradation of political debate. '
            'There are deep wells of potential material – the censorious '

            'minute into McGrath’s section, the show attempts to provoke with '

            'character even spells this out in case we missed the message), '
            'but it quickly feels repetitive.\n'
            'Some jokes – on remainers patronising working-class people and '
            'the tweeness of anti-Trump protests – do land. But many do '

            'of Hitler jokes too, Godwin’s law IRL. In these ways, it does '
            'bring Twitter to the West End. I hesitate to give this one star. '

            'world’s top 400 billionaires last year. Beasley then name-checked '
            'Jeff Bezos and Musk, pointing out that the latter saw a $6bn '
            'increase in his net worth in just one day last week. Asking '
            'obscenely rich people to help prevent imminent catastrophic '
            'famine seems reasonable enough to me. Musk, however, was very '
            'prickly about being asked to chip in. “If WFP can describe on '
            'this Twitter thread exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger, I '
            'will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,” he tweeted on Sunday. '
            '(This, by the way, was appended to a snarky tweet from one of his '
            'acolytes asking why the WFP hadn’t solved world hunger already, '
            'seeing as it raised $8.4bn in 2020.) Musk added that he would '
            'only pony up the money if the WFP used “open source accounting, '
            'so the public sees precisely how the money is spent”. The '
            'not-so-subtle subtext here was: I would obviously help end world '
            'hunger, but I can’t trust the WFP.\n'
            'Musk’s excuse for not handing over a tiny portion of his wealth '
            'to the WFP is hardly original. Billionaires love to sorrowfully '
            'declare that they are dying to pay more tax, but they can’t bear '
            'to see their money used inefficiently, so, for everyone’s sake, '
            'they had better hoard it instead. Last week, in response to a '
            '(very short-lived) plan by the Democrats to tax billionaires, '
            'BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he would happily part with more of '
            'his dosh if there were assurances it would be spent well. “If we '
            'could find solutions where the money could be directed in a '
            'proper way, I have more to give.” Fellow billionaire Ray Dalio '
            'also said he would willingly pay more tax if it accomplished '
            '“greater productivity” but sadly, he wasn’t sure that it did. '
            'Musk, meanwhile, insinuated that he was doing us all a favour by '
            'not paying more tax. “My plan is to use the money to get humanity '
            'to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness,” he tweeted last '
            'Thursday. A couple of days later he darkly warned that a '
            'billionaire tax would trickle down. “Eventually they run out of '
            'other people’s money, and then they come for you.” The '
            'government, of course, has already come for the majority of us. '
            'The median American household paid about 14% in federal taxes in '
            'recent years (that doesn’t include state taxes). Billionaires pay '
            'only a tiny fraction of that. ProPublica has calculated that '
            'Musk’s “true tax rate” is a minuscule 3.27%. But that’s OK; he is '
            'working overtime to “preserve the light of consciousness”. '
            'Millions of people may be on the brink of starvation, but Musk '

{'article': 'As world leaders, negotiators and activists converged on Glasgow '
            'for the start of the Cop climate summit, curious delegates who '
            'picked up a Scottish newspaper may have seen a small advert from '
            'the Scottish National party. Its main image was of Skye’s famous '
            'crags bathed by sunshine, with a soft-focus portrait of the first '
            'minister, and it read: “A nation in waiting welcomes the nations '
            'of the world.” Despite the simplicity of that proposition, public '
            'enthusiasm for independence has fallen since it reached a record '
            'high of 59% at the peak of the pandemic in October last year. '
            'Most opinion polls over the past six months have shown the yes '
            'vote trailing no by between four and eight points.\n'
            'Was that message misplaced? Her pro-UK opponents have accused '
            'Sturgeon of pursuing a “divisive obsession” as the rest of the '
            'world focused on a collective effort to combat a global crisis – '
            'a charge she denies. Hardliners inside the independence movement '
            'fear Sturgeon has lost her spark, fatigued by the long hours she '
            'invested managing the Covid crisis, the impacts of Brexit and the '
            'Alex Salmond crisis, and running her government. Last week she '
            'broached the issue of life after politics, disclosing to Vogue '
            'magazine she may foster children in the future. Some internal '
            'critics, bolstered by their allies in Salmond’s small breakaway '
            'party Alba, are openly challenging Sturgeon on the timing of a '
            'referendum, and question her appetite for staging one. Angus '
            'MacNeil, a dissident SNP MP who chairs the Commons trade '
            'committee, implied in a newspaper column last week that Sturgeon '
            'knew Boris Johnson would never agree to a referendum and that the '
            'supreme court would block any attempt by her to stage one without '
            'his approval. She had to find another route to secure '
            'independence, he argued. Yet there are few concrete signs '
            'Sturgeon is as ambivalent as her critics allege. When she set out '
            'her programme for government in September, she said civil '
            'servants had been told to start drafting a new case for '
            'independence. Conscious, too, of the public mood, Sturgeon '
            'insists that combating Covid takes immediate precedence over '
            'pushing for a fresh independence vote. And her strategists have '
            'their eyes on other factors, the Cop climate talks among them. '
            'What Cop may do is nudge cautious Scottish voters into taking a '
            'more green- and climate-minded worldview. If so, that could work '
            'to Sturgeon’s long-term advantage and that of the wider '
            'independence movement. Her SNP government is sharing power for '
            'the first time in 14 years with the pro-independence Scottish '
            'Greens. For the first time since devolution in 1999, there are '
            'Green ministers at Holyrood and their agreement includes staging '
            'an independence vote before the next Scottish election.\n'
            'Glasgow’s designation as host city – perhaps chosen by '
            'Conservative ministers in London to show the UK embracing '
            'Scotland – directly influenced Sturgeon’s decision to sign the '
            'deal with the Greens. It was a political decision, and not based '
            'on numerical advantage at Holyrood: she has aligned the SNP with '
            'a more leftwing party to amplify her government’s pro-climate '
            'claims, at a time when green politics, thanks to Cop, is '
            'ascendant. While Sturgeon does not have a seat at the negotiating '
            'table – no devolved administrations do at Cop – she is enjoying a '
            'significant profile at the conference locally, welcoming Greta '
            'Thunberg and the Minga Indígena collective, and campaigning for '
            'the voices of women and girls to be advanced in the talks. She is '
            'sufficiently distant from any policy failures at Cop not to be '
            'tainted by them, while able to point to the differences she says '
            'independence would bring. That strategy is likely to emerge '
            'clearly later in November, when the SNP is to hold a short party '
            'conference at which Sturgeon is expected to prioritise the drive '
            'for a second independence vote. Any policy failures at Cop and '
            'her government’s heavier emphasis on the climate and environment '
            'will feature heavily. If Cop helps shift the Scottish '
            'electorate’s mood, and finally makes voters amenable to the '
            'tougher changes to their energy use, and driving, shopping and '
            'holiday habits that cutting CO2 emissions involves, Sturgeon has '
            'gambled that the SNP and the case for independence will gain.',

{'article': 'More than 100 civilians in the Yemeni province of Marib have been '
            'killed or injured in the past month as fighting rages for the '
            'country’s last major government-loyal stronghold. Marib city has '
            'been under sustained attack since the beginning of the year from '
            'Houthi rebels, whose forces have steadily closed in on the '
            'central desert area on three different fronts. The fight for '
            'control of the oil-rich region has become one of the bloodiest '
            'and most important battles of Yemen’s seven-year-old civil war. '
            'If the rebels succeed in taking Marib they will effectively have '
            'beaten the Yemeni government and Saudi-backed coalition, which '
            'has managed to cling on to the city with the use of intensive '
            'airstrikes. On Sunday, at least 29 civilians were killed in a '
            'rebel missile strike which hit a mosque and religious school to '
            'the south of Marib city. The unverified death toll for all sides '
            'is now believed to run into the tens of thousands. “The situation '
            'has become very bad. It’s not just the fighting, it’s the '
            'economic collapse too,” said Hamas al-Muslimi, a 23-year-old '
            'student living in Marib but originally from Dhamar.\n'
            '“We used to be able to buy five pieces of bread for 100 rials '
            '[£0.30], but now we can only buy two.” For several years, Marib’s '
            'relative quiet and prosperity made it a beacon for more than 1 '
            'million Yemenis fleeing fighting in other parts of the country, '
            'like Muslimi and her family. Many live in vast displacement camps '
            'with no water or health facilities and no schools, and have been '
            'cut off from the little aid they do receive by Houthi advances '
            'over the last two months. According to aid agencies, about 10,000 '
            'people have been displaced in October alone, in what amounts to '
            'the biggest wave of displacement recorded in a single month this '
            'year. “Our staff can reach only a small portion of those in need '
            'in Marib, and what we provide is just a drop in the ocean '
            'compared to the staggering needs,” Erin Hutchinson, the Norwegian '
            'Refugee Council’s country director for Yemen, said in a '
            'statement. “We call on all parties to spare civilians and ensure '
            'that we can keep reaching them with life-saving aid. We also call '
            'on the international community to provide the promised funding to '
            'keep Yemenis alive in this hour of need.” Yemen’s war between the '
            'Iranian-backed Houthi movement and forces loyal to the exiled '
            'Yemeni government broke out in 2014 but deteriorated sharply '
            'after the intervention of a Saudi-led coalition the following '
            'year. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have imposed strict '
            'religious edicts on the people living under their control, while '
            'the coalition has been widely criticised for bombing civilian '
            'infrastructure. The conflict has since spawned the world’s worst '
            'humanitarian crisis, with more than 70% of the population of 30 '
            'million in need of aid to survive. About half are food insecure, '
            'with 5 million already starving in pockets of famine-like '
            'conditions. Prior to the Houthi offensive on Marib, the war had '
            'largely deteriorated into a stalemate. Extensive UN-brokered '
            'talks in April and May to discuss a ceasefire for both Marib and '
            'the wider country stalled after the Houthis rejected a deal. '
            'Diplomatic observers fear that the rebel leadership has since '
            'decided that escalating efforts to capture Marib will transform '
            'the bargaining calculus. The UK, which is the current penholder '
            'for Yemen at the UN security council, has licensed an estimated '
            '£20bn in arms exports to member states of the coalition since the '
            'conflict began. Earlier this year, the Foreign, Commonwealth and '
            'Development Office slashed the UK aid budget for Yemen by 60%.',

{'article': 'For its supporters, the 55-metre-tall turbine-blade-like '
            'sculpture jutting out of an isolated Northumberland hilltop will '
            'attract tourists and be a fitting tribute to Queen and '
            'Commonwealth. For opponents it will be “ecological vandalism” '
            'that spoils the landscape, an artwork that would not look out of '
            'place in communist-era eastern Europe. On Tuesday, a government '
            'planning inspector came down in favour of the sculpture, '
            'overturning a 2019 decision by Northumberland county council to '
            'refuse planning permission. It means the the scheme’s backers can '
            'go ahead with plans to install the work, nearly three times '
            'higher than Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North, on Cold Law, a '
            'small hill near Kirkwhelpington. The Elizabeth landmark, which '
            'will come with a walking trail, is called Ascendant. It has been '
            'designed by the artist Simon Hitchens and is intended as a '
            'tribute to the Queen in her platinum jubilee year. Made from '
            'steel, the work is meant to look like a thin slice of the '
            'hillside, which has been cut north to south through the bedrock '
            'and then tilted and elevated.\n'
            'Mary Ann Rogers, a local artist and gallery owner, said she '
            'thought it looked outdated, like something from behind the iron '
            'curtain. She is a co-founder of the campaign group Keep the '
            'Wannies Wild, which, with 2,000 supporters, has been fighting the '
            'plan. “I am absolutely devastated,” she said. “I live only a '
            'couple of miles away from the site and it is a really special '
            'place. It’s somewhere I go to walk and be quiet and listen to the '
            'birds so I am absolutely gutted that they are going to do '
            'something so mad there.” Rogers said she was a fan of public art '
            'but there was no good reason for the sculpture. Nor was it '
            'appealing. “To me it is strident, it’s triumphant and it is vast. '
            'It looks more like a scimitar or a knife or a sword.” It was, she '
            'said, “ecological vandalism” and there was “monumental irony” '
            'that the decision was being announced during the Cop26 summit. '
            'The landowner and driving force behind Ascendant is the 3rd '
            'Viscount Devonport, Terence Kearley, who has been adamant that '
            'the development will have a minimal effect on the natural '
            'environment. He was, he said, delighted by the decision. “It is '
            'our ambition to create a sculpture that is not only celebratory '
            'of Queen Elizabeth II and the Commonwealth, but which is also a '
            'magnificent piece of artwork that acts as a beacon for visitors '
            'and tourists to the region – benefiting the local rural economy '
            'and businesses.” The task now is to raise the estimated £2-3m for '
            'the project, with campaigners conceding the battle is lost. '
            'Hitchens said his sculpture’s design “acknowledges the past, '
            'respects the present and aspires for a better future. “I believe '
            'the landmark will be a valuable asset to local communities and '
            'the north-east of England, as a cultural destination with a '

{'article': 'Stephen Colbert Late-night hosts recounted Biden’s first major '

            'in Rome, also the first major international conference since the '
            'Covid-19 pandemic. “The first time you see people in person '
            'post-pandemic is always awkward,” joked Stephen Colbert on '
            'Monday’s Late Show.\n'
            '“Which explains the G20 itinerary: see another world leader '
            'approaching; wonder if they’re going for a handshake; notice '
            'they’re actually coming in for a hug; hug them, only to realize '
            'maybe they weren’t, and you just made it awkward; call out the '
            'fact that you made it awkward and joke about how you’ve forgotten '
            'how to interact with other humans; solve climate change?” At the '
            'conference, G20 leaders pledged to achieve “global net zero '
            'greenhouse gas emissions … by or around mid-century”.\n'
            '“That doesn’t sound very urgent,” Colbert mocked. “It’s like '
            'calling 911 and having the operator tell you the EMTs will be '
            'there sometime between the hours of noon and the funeral.” The '
            'summit wrapped with a group of leaders symbolically tossing coins '
            'into Rome’s famed Trevi fountain. “Not a great sign when global '
            'cooperation has reached the stage of ‘wish!’” remarked Colbert. '
            'Trevor Noah\n'
            'On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the president’s visit '
            'with Pope Francis before the G20 summit. Biden, a Catholic, ended '
            'the three-hour meeting by saying “God love ya” and gifted the '
            'pope a sentimental “challenge coin”, historically collectible '
            'items which originated in the military. According to Biden, the '
            'coin included insignia of the 261st Signal Brigade unit in the '
            'Delaware army national guard, in which his late son, Beau Biden, '
            'served as a captain. “You’ve gotta give it to Joe Biden, because '
            'it took everything in his power as an old man to not make that '
            'coin appear behind the pope’s ear,” joked Noah. “Also, the fact '
            'that he said ‘God love ya’ to the pope – that is the most '
            'unnecessary ‘God love ya’ in history,” he continued. “You don’t '
            'need to say ‘God love ya’ to the pope, he knows God loves him! He '
            'had dinner with him last night. “But I do think that meeting was '
            'cool to see,” he concluded, “because it’s nice that even though '
            'these two men are some of the most powerful leaders in the world, '
            'when it comes down to it, they’re just a couple old guys hanging '
            'out, showing off their coin collection, talking about alcohol, '
            'making inappropriate ethnic jokes. I mean, forget the Vatican, '
            'these two should’ve been meeting in a sauna.” Seth Meyers\n'

            'the Trump White House detailing the events of 6 January that the '
            'former president is trying to keep hidden from the investigating '
            'House committee In a court filing on Saturday, the National '
            'Archives released a list of over 700 pages of documents from call '
            'logs to handwritten notes and schedules during and around the '
            'riot on 6 January that stormed the Capitol. “Personally, I’m '
            'shocked the Trump White House even had any records at all,” '
            'Meyers said. “I assumed that place was like a RadioShack in a '
            'zombie movie. Most of the call logs probably say ‘some guy called '
            '– sounded French’ or ‘Rudy Giuliani butt dial’ over and over '
            'again. “And there’s an obvious reason Trump wants to keep those '
            'records hidden,” he continued. “Trump and cronies had a detailed '
            'plan for overturning election results, and they tried to execute '
            'that plan, and they almost succeeded. It wasn’t an impulse or a '
            'whim; it was a plot.” Jimmy Kimmel\n'
            'And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked Donald Trump for '
            'attending a World Series game in Atlanta despite repeated '
            'distancing of team ownership. Major League Baseball denied making '
            'an invitation to Trump and said in a statement: “He requested to '
            'attend the game.” The former president and the Atlanta Braves '
            'have a one-sided, tumultuous history. Just months ago, when Major '
            'League Baseball pulled the All-Star game from Atlanta over '
            'Georgia’s new law restricting voting rights, Trump called on his '
            'followers to “boycott baseball”. “That was in April of this year. '
            'Six months later, he’s guzzling Diet Coke and doing the ‘Tomahawk '
            'chop’ at a Braves game in Atlanta,” Kimmel said. “The only '
            'exercise he gets is if it’s something racist. “People were '
            'wondering if he would do the ‘Tomahawk chop,’” Kimmel added of '
            'the gameday tradition dance which has come under scrutiny for '
            'racist appropriation from Native Americans. “Of course he would '
            'do the Tomahawk chop! I give him two days before he starts '
            'telling people he invented the Tomahawk chop. “Trump has a lot of '
            'resentment toward Native Americans because they know how to run '
            'successful casinos,” he quipped. Saturday’s game also marked '
            'Melania Trump’s first public appearance since July, and she did '
            'not seem enthused. While being introduced by an announcer with '
            'her husband, the former First Lady appeared to grimace. “If we '
            'could somehow harness the energy of Melania’s hatred for Donald '
            'Trump, we could power the world,” joked Kimmel.',

{'article': 'Yahoo has announced its withdrawal from the Chinese market in the '
            'latest retreat by foreign technology firms responding to '
            'Beijing’s tightening control over the industry. “In recognition '
            'of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in '
            'China, Yahoo’s suite of services will no longer be accessible '
            'from mainland China as of November 1,” the company said on '
            'Tuesday. The timing of the pullout coincided with the '
            'implementation of China’s new data protection law, which came '
            'into effect on Monday. The legislation, which was years in the '
            'making, was likened by some to the Chinese equivalent to the '
            'stringent GDPR in Europe.\n'
            'The law limits the conditions under which companies can gather '
            'personal information and sets rules for how it is used. Chinese '
            'laws also stipulate that companies operating in the country must '
            'hand over data if requested by authorities, making it difficult '
            'for international firms to operate in China as they may face '
            'pressure at home over giving in to Beijing’s demands. In the '
            'run-up to the implementation of the new legislation, foreign tech '
            'companies have been informing their users of the changes in their '
            'services in recent months. Yahoo’s withdrawal came less than a '
            'month after another US tech company, Microsoft’s professional '
            'networking platform LinkedIn, announced it was shutting down '
            'operations in China.. In public, the company blamed a '
            '“significantly more challenging operating environment” as well as '
            '“greater compliance requirements in China”. On Tuesday, Yahoo '
            'users in mainland China were told the company’s services would no '
            'longer be accessible. The products affected included Aol.com and '
            'news outlets such as TechCrunch. Users of apps such as Yahoo '
            'Weather were told in October that it would be discontinued this '
            'month, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo has had a '
            'tumultuous and controversial existence in mainland China. In '
            '2007, the company was criticised by lawmakers in the US after it '
            'handed over data on two Chinese dissidents to the the '
            'authorities, eventually leading to their imprisonment. In recent '
            'years, as regulations toward foreign tech companies hardened and '
            'domestic competition grew, Yahoo began to downsize its operations '
            'in China. In 2015, it closed its Beijing office. Analysts say '
            'Yahoo’s withdrawal from China is largely symbolic as at least '
            'some of Yahoo’s services, including its web portal, have already '
            'been blocked. China has also blocked other US internet services, '
            'such as Facebook and Google. Mainland users who wish to access '
            'these websites use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent '
            'the block. The Associated Press contributed to this report',

{'article': 'Before we get into it all, let me begin by saying nothing could '
            'ever make me question the immense dignity, sanctity and class of '
            'the US legal process. It’s really just the latest jewel in the '
            'royal family’s many, many crowns that the 95-year-old Queen’s son '
            'is now being represented by the guy also defending Armie Hammer '
            'over his whole cannibal-fetish-rape situation. Hammer denies all, '
            'but you probably know that. And you certainly know most of the '
            'Andrew facts. He is accused in a US civil court by former Jeffrey '
            'Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleges that the '
            'prince sexually assaulted her at Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan '
            'and at other locations in 2001 when she was 17. He denies all the '
            'accusations – and it’s been a long old road to get to even this '
            'point. But once Andrew had finally allowed lawyers to serve him '
            'the papers relating to this civil case, a certain change of pace '
            'was inevitable. I guess we all grow out of our family’s heritage '
            'law firms eventually, and want to make our own way in the world '
            'of more avant garde legal possibilities. At some point in recent '
            'months, the prince seems to have decided that the people who deal '
            'with the Queen’s dog licences and estates exemptions and so on '
            'aren’t the kind of hip-and-hardcore legal eagles more suited to '
            'his specific needs and aspirations. We all want to be our own '
            'person, you know? Even if that person is “61-year-old former chum '
            'of a known paedo whose mum is paying his legal bills”. The chum’s '
            'legal bills, not the paedo’s. Prince Andrew is simply accused of '
            'sex offences against a minor – accusations he has long denied. So '
            'there is absolutely no suggestion that at some point Andrew '
            'finally tired of being in social seclusion in this deer park or '
            'on that grouse moor, and screamed: “Just get me what Armie '
            'Hammer’s having!” (Apart from anything else, that kind of order '
            'could lead to a quite grotesque misunderstanding.) But the fact '
            'is, HRH is now being represented by Hollywood power attorney '
            'Andrew Brettler. And the gloves are suddenly well and truly off. '
            'How else to explain a new legal filing that teeters on the edge '
            'of victim blaming – and then plummets right into it, rolls around '
            'it, wallows deeply in it, and then finishes off by making snow '
            'angels in it? Lodged with the US district court in Manhattan last '
            'Friday, this 36-page motion begins by saying that Giuffre “may '
            'well” be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Epstein, in '
            'which case “nothing can excuse, nor fully capture the abhorrence '
            'and gravity of Epstein’s monstrous behavior against Giuffre”. '
            'Indeed, Andrew’s lawyers would like to proceed “without '
            'diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein’s alleged '
            'misconduct”. Alas, the filing then goes on to: accuse Giuffre of '
            'seeking “another payday” at the prince’s expense; claim she has '
            '“milk[ed] the publicity” of her association for years; reference '
            'a tabloid newspaper article in which nameless former associates '
            'brand her a “money-hungry sex kitten” and “head bitch”; break out '
            'a whole section supposedly dedicated to “Giuffre’s role in '
            'Epstein’s criminal enterprise”; claim she recruited and '
            'trafficked young girls for sexual abuse and did so in a way that '
            'was “wilful”; suggests her long-running pursuit of justice is '
            'diverting judicial time and resources from true victims of abuse; '
            'and more – so much more. Which all feels – let’s go out on a limb '
            'here – fairly diminishing. Anyone wondering vaguely whether '
            'Andrew’s reputation could be damaged any further now has their '
            'answer: yes, most definitely. At first glance it might seem '
            'bizarre that the guy who inspired such outrage for completely '
            'failing to express sympathies for Epstein’s victims during his '
            'infamous Newsnight interview should be doubling down on that '
            'front. Indeed, that original glaring omission was followed by a '
            'friend of his materialising in the newspapers to insist that, '
            'while the prince didn’t regret the interview itself, “the fact he '
            'was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy '
            'for the victims of Epstein is of course a source of regret”. Is '
            'it bollocks. There are two overriding impressions to be gleaned '
            'from this latest filing. One, that Prince Andrew has finally '
            'decided he’s in the dogfight of his life, and will now say '
            'absolutely anything to prevail in it. And two, that his total '
            'blindness to the silly little tragedies of Virginia Roberts '
            'Giuffre and all the silly little girls like her has lifted not '
            'one iota, despite everything that has happened. I don’t know '
            'about being biologically incapable of sweating, but on this '
            'evidence he certainly seems biologically incapable of having the '
            'first or faintest clue. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist',

{'article': 'Chinese families have been encouraged to stockpile daily '

            'prices linked to recent extreme weather, fears of supply '
            'shortages and an ongoing Covid outbreak. A notice posted on the '
            'website of the Ministry of Commerce late on Monday urged local '
            'authorities to stabilise prices and families “to store a certain '
            'amount of daily necessities as needed to meet daily life and '
            'emergencies”. It prompted some alarm and speculation, including '
            'that it related to increasing tensions with Taiwan. Related '
            'hashtags were viewed more than 18m times. “As soon as this news '
            'came out, all the old people near me went crazy panic-buying in '
            'the supermarket,” wrote one user on Weibo. State media urged calm '
            'and Zhu Xiaoliang, a senior commerce ministry official, told the '
            'broadcaster CCTV “the supply of daily necessities is sufficient '
            'everywhere” but varying explanations were offered for the notice. '
            'Some said the commerce department often releases such warnings in '
            'the weeks before national holidays while the People’s Daily said '
            'the ministry had issued its instruction earlier this year because '
            'of natural disasters, the surge in vegetable prices and recent '
            'Covid cases. The Economic Daily, a state-backed newspaper, warned '
            'residents against having “too much of an overactive imagination” '
            'but also said the directive was linked to the outbreak and was to '
            'ensure people were prepared in the event of a lockdown. About 500 '
            'cases of the Delta variant have been recorded across at least 16 '
            'of China’s 31 provinces. Authorities have enacted localised '
            'lockdowns, halted movement and travel, and launched mass testing. '
            'On Sunday more than 30,000 people were stopped from leaving '
            'Shanghai Disneyland until they were all tested, after one case '
            'was detected in a woman who might have visited. Despite '
            'reassurances, some were still sceptical. A Weibo user commented '
            'there had been no warnings to stock up at the outset of the 2020 '
            'pandemic. “This is the first time such a reminder notice has been '
            'issued! ! I’m a little scared.” “It is definitely not a normal '
            'reminder,” said another. “Reminding us to stockpile will '
            'inevitably make the market supply and demand unstable, price '
            'fluctuations, and cause panic among some people … It is very '
            'likely to be a special situation.” Extreme weather last month '
            'destroyed crops in China’s biggest vegetable growing region, '
            'Shandong, threatening this year’s efforts to increase supplies '
            'before the lunar new year holiday early next year. Last week, '
            'prices of cucumbers, spinach and broccoli had more than doubled '
            'from early October. Spinach was more expensive than some cuts of '
            'pork at 16.67 yuan ($2.60) per kg, a vegetable price index in '
            'Shouguang, a trading hub in Shandong, indicated. Although prices '

{'article': 'BP has warned that gas markets will remain “tight” during the '
            'winter months after rocketing global gas markets fuelled '
            'higher-than-expected profits and an extra $1.25bn returns for its '
            'shareholders. The global gas supply crisis, which threatens to '
            'increase costs for homes and businesses this winter, helped drive '
            'BP’s profits to $3.3bn (£2.4bn) for the third quarter, ahead of '
            'analysts’ forecasts of $3.1bn. The economic rebound from the '
            'depths of the Covid-19 pandemic last year has caused global oil '
            'and gas prices to surge to record highs in recent months, and '
            'lifted BP’s profits more than 38 times higher than a year ago.\n'
            'The FTSE 100 oil company will use its stronger cashflows to buy '
            'back an additional $1.25bn of shares, as part of the company’s '
            'plans to keep investors on side as it prepares to plough billions '
            'of dollars into renewable energy while shrinking its fossil fuel '
            'production. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, predicted '
            'that gas prices would stay high in the coming months. “All things '
            'being equal, of course that’s a big if, we would expect gas '
            'prices to return to normal probably by the summer of next year,” '
            'he told the Guardian. Commenting on the oil market, Looney said: '
            '“Over the medium term [the oil cartel] Opec is demonstrating '
            'strong discipline and importantly the US shale business, which '
            'typically would respond strongly in a situation like this, has '
            'become very financially disciplined. “Demand is strong but we’re '
            'not yet at pre-Covid levels.” He said it was “not unreasonable to '
            'expect prices to remain at this level for some time to come,” '
            'adding: “If oil prices remain strong and it’s very possible that '
            'they will, then you can see the sort of financial results that we '
            'can generate today.” Prices of wholesale gas have soared because '
            'of low storage levels after an especially cold winter in Europe '
            'last year and increased energy demand from Asia. The cost of gas '
            'for delivery in November hit an all-time high of 407p a therm in '
            'early October, though has since fallen back. In December last '
            'year it was just 45p. Oil prices have also climbed, and '
            'inventories have fallen towards pre-pandemic levels, BP noted. It '
            'expects oil prices to be underpinned by a further decline in '
            'inventories and possibly additional demand from gas to oil '
            'switching. It said that decisions taken on production levels by '
            'the Opec+ oil cartel of big producers including Russia continued '
            'to be an important factor in oil prices and market rebalancing. '
            'Brent crude is now trading at about $85 a barrel. Last week, '
            'Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the '
            'world’s biggest fund manager, warned that there was a “high '
            'probability” of oil hitting $100 a barrel. Despite benefiting '
            'from higher prices in the third quarter, shares in BP were down '
            '3.5% on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC '
            'Markets, said the results overall were “underwhelming”. BP '

            'maintenance and the impact of Hurricane Ida on production in the '
            'Gulf of Mexico. For 2021 as a whole, BP expects production to be '

            '$6bn to $7bn as part of its plan to trim the size of its fossil '

            'Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said BP’s '

            '“High prices have driven strong year-on-year growth in profits, '
            'and that’s being used to fund a generous $1.25bn share buyback. '
            'Coming on top of a $1.4bn buyback announced at the half year '
            'stage the group is firmly focused on shareholder returns at '
            'present. However, you can reasonably question whether that '
            'generosity is justified,” Hyett added. The analyst warned that BP '
            'will need to deliver a strong final quarter result to make sure '
            'its debt doesn’t begin to rise again. The company is making '
            'payments relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 of '
            'about $1.5bn before tax this year.',

{'article': 'An Israeli government minister has received an apology from Boris '
            'Johnson and the organisers of Cop26 after she could not attend '
            'the summit on Monday due to a lack of wheelchair accessibility. '
            'Karine Elharrar, Israel’s minister of energy and water resources, '
            'described how she was denied entry to the summit because as a '
            'wheelchair user she was unable to access the Glasgow venue, '
            'criticising the refusal to accommodate her as “outrageous”. '
            'Elharrar, who has muscular dystrophy, waited for two hours '
            'outside after organisers refused to let her enter the compound in '
            'the vehicle in which she had arrived, she said.\n'
            'Her office said she was eventually offered a shuttle transport to '
            'the summit area, but the shuttle was not wheelchair-accessible, '
            'forcing her to return to her hotel in Edinburgh. She wrote on '
            'Twitter: “I came to Cop26 to meet with my counterparts around the '
            'world and promote a common struggle in the climate crisis. It is '
            'sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with '
            'disabilities, in 2021, does not provide accessibility to its '
            'events.” An official in the Israeli prime minister Naftali '
            'Bennett’s delegation said they had formally complained to '
            'organisers, the Times of Israel reported. Bennett reportedly said '
            'Elharrar’s vehicle would arrive at the summit area on Tuesday as '
            'part of his official convoy, thus ensuring her entry. Johnson '
            'later apologised personally to Elharrar when she joined a meeting '
            'between him and Bennett, saying he was sorry for the “confusion”. '
            'Bennett thanked his British counterpart for his “quick '
            'intervention on this unfortunate incident” and called it a '
            '“learning opportunity for all of us in the importance of '
            'accessibility for all”, a statement backed by Johnson. Cop26 '
            'organisers tweeted: “Regarding minister Elharrar’s experience at '
            'the entry point yesterday, this was a genuine mistake and we have '
            'apologised for that. We are pleased to see her in attendance at '
            'Cop26 today. Cop26 must be inclusive and accessible to all and '
            'the venue is designed to facilitate that.” Elharrar told BBC News '
            'she had gone into the climate summit on Tuesday “very easily” and '
            'it was “quite a different experience”. Earlier the UK environment '
            'secretary, George Eustice, said: “We deeply regret that '
            'incident.” He added there appeared to have been a '
            'miscommunication and organisers had not been aware of Elharrar’s '
            'requirements in advance and so had not made the right provisions '
            'at the particular entrance she was coming to. “I know that at '
            'most of the other entrances, wheelchair access is there. It was '
            'because she came to an entrance where they didn’t have that '
            'provision,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that '
            'action should have been taken to resolve the issue. A '
            'spokesperson from the Israeli embassy in London told BBC News the '
            'country’s delegation to the summit had “communicated over the '
            'past several weeks all the details about the minister’s '
            'requirements”. The UK ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan, tweeted '
            'that he had apologised “deeply and sincerely” to the minister. '
            '“We want a Cop summit that is welcoming and inclusive to '
            'everyone,” he wrote. The Foreign Office minister James Cleverly '
            'tweeted: “I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that minister '
            '@KElharrar could not access Cop today. The Cop venue is designed '
            'to be accessible for all. I have spoken to the minister about '
            'this and I look forward to meeting her tomorrow.” Elharrar told '
            'Israel’s Channel 12 news: “The only way they said I could come in '
            'was to walk on foot for almost a kilometre, or to board a shuttle '
            'which was not wheelchair-accessible.” She told Ynetnews.com that '
            'organisers blocked all roads leading to the conference and left '
            'her out despite the Israeli delegation’s best efforts to convince '
            'security to let her in. “It was impossible to get in with a car '
            'and I could not make that distance independently,” she said. '
            '“It’s outrageous conduct and it should not have happened. I came '
            'for certain purposes and could not achieve them today, but there '
            'will be other opportunities. “The UN calls on everyone to act in '
            'accordance with the international convention and to make places '
            'accessible, so it is fitting that its events should be '
            'accessible. I sincerely hope that today’s lesson will be learned '
            'so that tomorrow promoting green energies, removing barriers and '
            'energy efficiency will be the only things I have to deal with.”',

{'article': 'Alex Gino’s award-winning children’s novel about a trans girl, '
            'George, is being renamed Melissa, after Gino and publisher '
            'Scholastic said they made a mistake in titling it with a name '
            '“the main character does not like or want to use for herself”. '
            'Published in 2015, the novel follows the story of trans fourth '
            'grader Melissa, who is seen by everyone as a boy named George, '
            'but who decides to reveal who she really is by playing the role '
            'of Charlotte in her class play, Charlotte’s Web. It won the '
            'American novelist, whose pronouns are they and them, literary '
            'prizes including the Children’s Stonewall award, the Lambda '
            'literary award, and a Children’s Choice book award. But Gino said '
            'this summer that it had been a mistake to title the novel George, '
            'apologised to the character and to the wider trans community, and '
            'began changing the title to Melissa’s Story when signing books '
            'for fans.\n'
            '“The title of my book made it seem as though it is OK to use an '
            'old name for a person when they have provided you with a '
            'different name that works better for them. I want to be clear – '
            'it isn’t,” Gino said at the time. “The cover is beautiful. '
            'Iconic, even. But here’s the thing: so many transgender people '
            'have been told that we are beautiful/handsome as a reason not to '
            'transition, myself included. We are told that we will mar '
            'something special, as though looking pleasant to others is more '
            'important than being ourselves. As if it’s not more important '
            'than seeing who’s really there, scars and all.” Gino explained '
            'that the original title came about because while they were '
            'writing the novel, they “jokingly” called it Girl George, playing '
            'on the singer Boy George. Scholastic, after acquiring the story, '
            'advised taking the word “girl” off the cover when publishing '
            'because “there would be some people who wouldn’t give the book to '
            'a boy if it had the word girl on it”; Gino, “stunned” to be '
            'published at all, agreed. “I wish I had realised to speak up '
            'then,” they said this summer.\n'
            'Now Scholastic and Gino are officially changing the title of the '
            'book from George to Melissa “to respect Melissa and all trans '
            'people”, said the author. Scholastic, which will publish the new '
            'edition from next April in the US, added: “What we call people '
            'matters and we all deserve to be addressed in ways that feel good '
            'to us. Once you see a mistake, you can always change it.” Gino’s '
            'UK publisher, Scholastic UK, said it would also be replacing '
            'George with Melissa from the next reprint. “No matter how many '
            'people have come to know it as George, we felt it was important '
            'to fix the title,” said Gino, urging readers to either make the '
            'title change themselves, print out new covers from Scholastic’s '
            'website, or buy a new copy once Melissa is published. “The text '
            'inside won’t change, so the name George will still appear to '
            'reflect the character’s growth within the novel, but Melissa will '
            'be the first name readers will know her by.”',

{'article': 'A plan to coordinate the global introduction of clean '
            'technologies in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been '
            'agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders representing '
            'two-thirds of the world’s economy. A global transition to green '
            'energy and vehicles is vital in tackling the climate crisis, and '
            'economies of scale mean that costs plummet as production '
            'increases – as already seen with solar panels and LED lightbulbs. '
            'More than 40 nations said they would align standards and '
            'coordinate investments to speed up production and bring forward '
            'the “tipping point” at which green technologies are more '
            'affordable and accessible than fossil-fuelled alternatives. At '
            'that point, the green transition and cuts in climate emissions '
            'accelerate rapidly towards a net zero economy. Among the '
            'countries signed up to the Breakthrough Agenda are the UK, US, '
            'China, India, the EU and Australia. The first five breakthroughs '
            'will be clean electricity, electric vehicles, green steel, '
            'hydrogen and sustainable farming. The aim is to make these '
            'affordable and available to all nations by 2030 and create 20m '
            'new jobs. “By making clean technology the most affordable, '
            'accessible and attractive choice, the default go-to in what are '
            'currently the most polluting sectors, we can cut emissions right '
            'around the world,” said Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, '
            'which is hosting Cop26.\n'
            '“The Glasgow Breakthroughs will turbocharge this forward, so that '
            'by 2030 clean technologies can be enjoyed everywhere, not only '
            'reducing emissions but also creating more jobs and greater '
            'prosperity,” said Johnson, who launched a £3bn finance package on '
            'Monday to support green technology in developing countries. New '
            'plans include a global electricity initiative launched by the UK '
            'and India and endorsed by 80 nations. The Green Grids Initiative '
            'aims to mobilise political will and finance to create '
            'international supergrids on all continents and to link up sunny '
            'deserts and windy coasts with population centres. By connecting '
            'many locations, supergrids are key to providing reliable '
            'electricity from renewable energy that may be locally '
            'intermittent. Another new initiative is the Global Energy '
            'Alliance for People & Planet, which is focused on producing clean '
            'electricity across the global south. It has an initial $10bn from '
            'the World Bank, Rockefeller Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund and '
            'others. UK and Scandinavian pension funds also announced on '
            'Tuesday they would invest $130bn in clean energy by 2030. The '
            'authors of a report published to support the Breakthrough Agenda '
            'concluded: “International collaboration can create faster '
            'innovations, larger economies of scale, and stronger incentives '
            'for investment, to accelerate progress towards tipping points '
            'where clean solutions become the most affordable, accessible and '
            'attractive options worldwide.” The Breakthrough Agenda follows '
            'other voluntary agreements at Cop26 on ending deforestation by '
            '2030 and cutting global emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse '
            'gas, by 30%. These commitments have been broadly welcomed, but '
            'some delegates warned that global heating would not be reduced '
            'unless the plans become reality. Nations at the two-week summit '
            'are also tasked with getting funding to poorer and vulnerable '
            'countries and finalising the rules of the 2015 Paris agreement. '
            'The cost of solar panels, LED bulbs and lithium ion batteries '
            'have plunged by about 90% in the past decade, with solar and wind '
            'power now the cheapest power in most of the world. By '
            'coordinating signals to industry, policies and standards, '
            'research efforts and investments, the governments aim to drive '
            'production up and prices down for other technologies.\n'
            'Electric cars are already cheaper to run than those burning '
            'fossil fuels and are close to the tipping point when they become '
            'cheaper to buy. Requiring carmakers across big markets to make a '
            'certain proportion of new cars electric, for example, could '
            'increase this. The nations will coordinate to speed up the growth '
            'of markets, but will also compete to supply those markets. A '
            'recent study from Oxford University estimated the costs of clean '
            'energy technologies such as batteries and hydrogen electrolysers '
            'could fall by 45% by 2030 and 75% by 2050 with speedy deployment. '
            'The private sector is involved in the Breakthrough Agenda with a '
            '“first movers coalition” of 25 global companies committing to buy '
            'emerging clean technologies in sectors such as steel, trucking, '
            'shipping, aviation and concrete. Firms are expected to include '
            'the shipping company Maersk and the cement maker Holcim. In '
            'farming, coordinated rules for blocking imports of beef, soy, '
            'palm and cocoa linked to deforestation could hasten the end of '
            'forest destruction. A US-UAE initiative, backed by 30 countries, '
            'has gathered $4bn (£2.9bn) for investment in climate-smart '
            'agriculture. World leaders have committed to discussing and '
            'strengthening global progress on breakthroughs every year, '
            'supported by reports led by the International Energy Agency. The '
            'Economics of Energy Innovation and System Transition report was '
            'produced by experts from the UK, EU, Brazil, China, and India. '
            '“The policies that drove major breakthroughs in low-carbon '
            'technologies like wind and solar, were challenged by traditional '
            'economic advice, which ignored the role of innovation [in '
            'reducing costs] and framed climate policy as costly,” said Prof '
            'Michael Grubb, at University College London and a co-author of '
            'the report. “We need to learn from these successes.” Prof '
            'Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said last week '
            'that most economists had badly underestimated the speed at which '
            'the costs of clean technologies fall and failed to take account '
            'of the “immense risks and potential loss of life” that could '
            'occur as a result of the climate crisis.',

{'article': 'The Georgia Republican responsible for running elections '
            'considered an infamous call in which Donald Trump told him to '
            '“find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state '
            'a “threat” to his safety and that of his family.\n'
            'Biden’s victory in Georgia was a narrow but vital part of his '
            'national win. No Democratic presidential candidate had taken the '
            'state since Bill Clinton in 1992. Trump called Brad '
            'Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, nearly two months '
            'after election day, on Saturday 2 January. Telling him “it’s '
            'pretty clear we won”, the then president said: “I just want to '
            'find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have [to get]” to '
            'surpass Biden’s total. Raffensperger, a conservative who '
            'supported Trump, resisted the president’s demands. That prompted '
            'Trump to suggest the refusal to expose mass voter fraud in '
            'Georgia – on which Trump insisted but which did not exist, as in '
            'all other states – could be a “criminal offense”. “That’s a big '
            'risk to you,” Trump said. “That’s a big risk.” In Integrity '
            'Counts, a book published on Tuesday, Raffensperger writes: “I '
            'felt then – and still believe today – that this was a threat. '
            'Others obviously thought so, too, because some of Trump’s more '
            'radical followers have responded as if it was their duty to carry '
            'out this threat.” Raffensperger details death threats texted to '
            'his wife, an encounter with men who may have been staking out his '
            'home, and being escorted out of the Georgia state capitol on 6 '
            'January as rightwing protesters entered. A recording of Trump’s '
            'call was released to the Washington Post and became a key exhibit '
            'in Trump’s second impeachment trial, for inciting the deadly '
            'attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, by supporters seeking to '
            'overturn the election. Trump was acquitted when only seven '
            'Republican senators could be persuaded to vote for his guilt. He '
            'remains free to run for president again and dominates the '
            'Republican party but his attempts to overturn his defeat in '
            'Georgia have contributed to his extensive legal jeopardy. The '
            'Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, is investigating. '
            'Raffensperger told the Associated Press investigators “talked to '
            'some of our folks here. We sent all the documents and she can now '
            'buy the book online”. The Associated Press contributed to this '

{'article': 'Elysée officials have expressed fury at the decision of '
            'Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to leak a private text '
            'message from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the '
            'diplomatic rift between the two countries deepened. “Confidence '
            'has been completely shattered,” a close adviser to Macron told '
            'French media on Tuesday. “Disclosing a text message exchange '
            'between heads of state or government is a pretty crude and '
            'unconventional tactic.” The adviser told Le Parisien that it '
            '“would never even enter the head” of the French president to '
            'disclose communications of this kind. “It is not the kind of '
            'thing that is likely to improve relations between France and '
            'Australia,” they said.\n'
            'In the text, two days before the announcement of the Aukus '
            'security partnership and the cancellation of a major French '
            'contract to supply submarines to Australia, Macron asked Morrison '
            'whether he could expect good or bad news on the submarines. Its '
            'publication came after Macron told reporters he “knew” that '
            'Morrison had lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to '
            'acquire nuclear-propelled submarines. Morrison rejected the claim '
            'and said he was “not going to cop sledging of Australia”. French '
            'media described the text message leak as “spectacular and '
            'extremely rare”, saying it appeared to be aimed at demonstrating '
            'that Macron had already been informed the contract might not go '
            'ahead even before it was torn up. But the Elysée official '
            'insisted the text showed rather that Macron “did not know what '
            'stage the discussions had got to” just two days before Australia '
            'called off the A$90bn (£49bn) deal for 12 conventionally powered '
            'submarines. A second French government source told Agence-France '
            'Presse that if a message existed that clearly showed that Macron '
            'did in fact know, “they would have reported that instead”. The '
            'source added: “We knew the Australians had some issues, but they '
            'only concerned technical aspects and the timetable, as with every '
            'big contract.” It was precisely those issues that the text '
            'message referred to, ahead of a discussion with submarine '
            'manufacturer Naval Group planned for the following day, the '
            'source said. It is not clear what response Morrison gave to the '
            'message. The Elysée also rejected Canberra’s account that it made '
            'multiple attempts to contact Paris to warn of the impending '
            'announcement. The official told Le Parisien only one phone call '
            'had come through to the palace, at 11am on a Wednesday – during '
            'Macron’s weekly cabinet meeting. “It is difficult to believe that '
            'the Australian prime minister has not been advised of this '
            'constraint,” the official said. “He knew very well the president '
            'was unavailable.” It was later that same day, the adviser said, '
            'that Paris had learned that the contract was being rescinded and '
            'that a press conference was to be held during the afternoon. '
            '“It’s a curious way of going about things,” the Elysée source '
            'told Le Parisien. “France was left with no opportunity to respond '
            'or to come up with a counter-proposition, which we had the means '
            'to do. Once again, it is not the choice that we denounce – that’s '
            'a sovereign decision. It’s the way of doing things.” The Elysée '
            'also said that Morrison could have sought a reconciliatory '
            'meeting with Macron in recent days, at the G20 meeting in Rome or '
            'the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. “The president was waiting '
            'for a proposition from the prime minister, which did not come,” '
            'the source said. Morrison spoke with Macron by phone last week, '
            'and the French president used that call to urge the Australian '
            'government to propose concrete steps to repair the relationship. '
            'Morrison insists that he “made very clear” to Macron at a dinner '
            'in Paris in mid-June “that a conventional diesel-powered '
            'submarine was not going to meet Australia’s strategic '
            'requirements”. But the Australian prime minister also said he '
            'wasn’t at liberty at that stage to disclose to Macron that '
            'Australia would work with the US and the UK to acquire '
            'nuclear-powered submarines, because those plans had not yet been '
            'finalised and were held “in confidence”.',

{'article': 'A Canadian official and academic specialising in Indigenous '
            'health issues has been placed on administrative leave from her '
            'university after an investigation challenged her claims of '
            'Indigenous ancestry. Carrie Bourassa, a professor at the '
            'University of Saskatchewan, has described herself as having '
            'Métis, Anishinaabe and Tlingit heritage. In 2019 she appeared at '
            'a TEDx talk wearing a blue embroidered shawl and holding a '
            'feather, where she identified herself as “Morning Star Bear”. '
            'However, an investigation by CBC television alleged that Bourassa '
            'was entirely of European descent. She recently stepped down from '
            'her role as scientific director for Indigenous peoples health at '
            'the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR). Bourassa had '
            'been described by the CIHR as “a Métis woman, a highly regarded '
            'Indigenous researcher” who “has been a selfless leader and a '
            'tireless champion for all Indigenous peoples in this country”. '
            'The CBC investigation has drawn comparisons with the case of '
            'Rachel Dolezal, an American academic and activist who was accused '
            'of passing herself off as black. A Métis professor who worked '
            'with Bourassa told CBC she was “the modern-day Grey Owl” – a '
            'reference to Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, the British-born '
            'conservationist and writer who passed himself off as a Native '
            'American in the early 20th century. CBC reported that people who '
            'worked with Bourassa had expressed disquiet about her account of '
            'her ancestry, and some examined her genealogical records, which '
            'reportedly showed that her ancestors were of Russian, Polish and '
            'Czechoslovakian descent. In an email to CBC, Bourassa said she '
            'had been adopted as Métis by a friend of her grandfather and had '
            'subsequently been adopted into other communities. She accused the '
            'broadcaster of running a “smear campaign” against her, adding she '
            'was “shocked and dismayed at the recent attack on my identity”. '
            'In a statement released by Bourassa after the claims were '
            'broadcast she said she identified as Métis and that elders who '
            'supported her did not rely on “blood quantums” to assess '
            'Indigenous identity. In comments reported in the Saskatoon '
            'StarPhoenix, she added: “Maybe in the fact that I’m trying so '
            'hard to pull pieces together, maybe I’ve forgotten certain '
            'things. It’s hard sometimes when you’re so anxious to find some '
            'of the gaps you know are there.” The treatment of Indigenous '
            'people in Canada has been in the spotlight in recent months after '
            'the discovery of unmarked grave sites at residential schools that '
            'had attempted to eradicate the culture and languages of '
            'Indigenous populations. Among those quoted by CBC was Janet '
            'Smylie, a health academic of Métis heritage at the University of '
            'Toronto, who wrote a chapter in a 2017 book on Indigenous '
            'parenting edited by Bourassa. Smylie told the broadcaster she had '
            'done her own research into Bourassa’s ancestry. “It makes you '
            'feel a bit sick,” she said. “To have an impostor who is speaking '
            'on behalf of Métis and Indigenous people to the country about '
            'literally what it means to be Métis … that’s very disturbing and '
            'upsetting and harmful.” The university and the health agency '
            'initially supported Bourassa, though on Monday the university '
            'issued a statement saying it had “serious concerns with the '
            'additional information revealed in Dr Bourassa’s responses to the '
            'media.”',

{'article': 'Sausages are my go-to quick dinner, but I always rely on the same '
            'recipes. How can I jazz them up? Tessa, Glasgow “I love sausages '
            'in any guise, and the simpler, the better,” says Stosie Madi, '
            'chef and co-owner of the Parkers Arms in Newton-in-Bowland, '
            'Lancashire. “They are, however, also a wonderful driver for lots '
            'of fun dishes.” So how can you get more, er, bang from your '
            'banger? If you’re cooking for a crowd this Bonfire Night, Tom '
            'Kerridge suggests channelling pigs in blankets: “Dust your '
            'sausages with a little curry powder, wrap them in bacon, then '
            'cook them on the barbecue or in the oven,” says the chef/patron '
            'of Michelin-starred The Hand & Flowers in Marlow, '
            'Buckinghamshire. Then tuck them in hot dog buns with smoked '
            'cheese and serve with “mayonnaise mixed with German mustard, '
            'chopped dill, cornichons and shallots”. For ultimate autumn '
            'vibes, Tommy Heaney, chef/patron of Heaneys in Cardiff, braises '
            'lentils, onion and bacon, tosses them with roast pumpkin, and '
            'serves topped with sausages and salsa verde. Heaney makes the '
            'latter with mint, parsley, watercress, capers, gherkins, '
            'anchovies and sea salt: “I love pork with mint,” he says. “It’s '
            'not traditional, but it works really well.” And if you’re '
            'lighting a bonfire, “brown the sausages, onions and pumpkin, put '
            'them all in a casserole with some stock and whack it straight on '
            'the fire”. Finish with a dollop of the same salsa verde, and it’s '
            'job done. Pumpkins are also welcome in a “sausage tagine-type '
            'thing”, says Madi, who mixes roast squash with ready-cooked '
            'chickpeas and spiced couscous. “The couscous is the carrier of '
            'the spice, so add cumin, harissa, a little chilli to give it some '
            'heat.” Serve with grilled sausages and garlic-yoghurt for “a '
            'lovely centrepiece”. Alternatively, up the ante with something '
            'more theatrical: “Hollow out a pumpkin, roast the flesh and make '
            'an almost-pureed, velvety soup,” she says, then pour into the '
            'pumpkin shell. “Roast some sausages, put them on skewers and dip '
            'into the soup to add a bit of fun.” While sausages defy the '
            'seasons, come autumn, they’re particularly good in pasta, '
            'traybakes, cassoulet or, Madi says, simply with spuds: “Cut up '
            'some grilled sausages, put them on a nice layer of mash, add lots '
            'of cheese and grill.” Then there are stews, which, Kerridge says, '
            'can easily be made with canned stuff. “Roast sausages in a pan to '
            'get loads of colour on them, throw in a drained tin of mixed '
            'beans, add a tin of tomato soup, bring to a boil, then reduce and '
            'add a good pinch of smoked paprika and some salt and pepper.” '
            'Serve with warm crusty bread for mopping. Perhaps the simplest '
            'solution, however, is a sausage wrap, which Madi endorses “every '
            'step of the way”. She brushes Lebanese flatbread with oil, adds '
            'the skinned sausagemeat, some cheese and/or onion if the mood '
            'takes her, folds the bread over, brushes with more oil and bakes '
            'at 180C for 12-15 minutes – “or just enough time to have a big '
            'glass of wine”. Dip into sweet chilli sauce-spiked yoghurt or '
            'serve with a tin of beans jazzed up with Tabasco. “Throw your '
            'shoes off and tuck in: there’s really nothing nicer.” • Got a '

{'article': 'It is a sport conceived originally by the founder of the modern '
            'Olympics to help cavalry riders to develop the skills needed to '
            'survive behind enemy lines. But after 109 years, modern '
            'pentathlon’s governing body has voted secretly to remove horse '
            'riding and replace it with cycling, the Guardian can reveal. '
            'Multiple sources have said the decision was taken by the Union '
            'Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne’s executive board in recent '
            'days, and was hastened by the distressing scenes at the Tokyo '
            'Olympics when a horse was punched by a German coach after it '
            'refused to jump a fence.\n'
            'Those pictures made global headlines and the UIPM is understood '
            'to have acted in order to preserve its status in the Olympics in '
            'the lead-up to the Paris 2024 Games. While the decision has not '
            'yet been announced officially, it is already facing a backlash '
            'from some countries who believe that losing the horse-riding '
            'element fundamentally changes the sport. Modern pentathlon has '
            'been a core Olympic event since 1912 when it was invented by '
            'Pierre de Coubertin – and while it has since moved from a '
            'five-day event to a solitary day it has always tested athletes in '
            'fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting, and '
            'cross-country running. The UIPM refused to deny the story when '
            'confronted by the Guardian, with a spokesperson saying: “I am not '
            'able to give you any information right now.” However, the '
            'organisation later released a statement: “As part of UIPM’s '
            'commitment to maintaining a strong, dynamic profile for modern '
            'pentathlon, a series of strategic meetings are being held. These '
            'meetings will include an upcoming call with national federations '
            'later this week. The outcome of these meetings will be detailed '
            'in a press release to be published on 4 November.” The former '
            'British modern pentathlete Kate Allenby, who won a bronze for '
            'Team GB at the Sydney Olympics, told the Guardian any move to '
            'replace riding would be a “disaster” for the sport. “This needs '
            'talking about because it’s not modern pentathlon if it hasn’t got '
            'riding in it,” she said. However another British Olympian Greg '
            'Whyte, who also won a world silver medal in 1994, said he could '
            'understand the change. “I don’t think it is necessarily a bad '
            'thing,” he said. “Back in the day, the fencing part alone used to '
            'take 14 hours, while in Paris the whole event will last just 90 '
            'minutes. All sports evolve, and no sport is immune from change in '
            'the modern TV era.”\n'
            'The UIPM is understood to have acted after the sport was heavily '
            'criticised in Tokyo. The German competitor Annika Schleu, who had '
            'been in the gold-medal position before the showjumping, was seen '
            'in tears after her ride, Saint Boy, refused to jump over the '
            'obstacles. The German coach Kim Raisner, who was seen punching '
            'Saint Boy, was sent home from Tokyo and the UIPM promised to '
            'conduct a full review as well as disciplining Raisner. Britain '
            'won the men’s and women’s modern pentathlon events at the Tokyo '

{'article': 'There was a setback last month for this play inspired by a hit '

            'two middle-aged divorcees – one nice, one nasty – embroil '
            'themselves in ever more baroque misadventures. But over two '
            'hours, the stage play does strain against the podcast conceit, '
            'which is that Brian and Roger communicate only via answerphone '
            'messages. One craves character development, which never really '
            'comes. The plot is circular too, in that it recounts a succession '
            'of scrapes into which Roger’s good nature allows Brian to '
            'entangle him. It begins small-scale, as the pair arrange to watch '
            'their Avatar DVD in Brian’s student digs, then proceeds to outdo '
            'itself ever more garishly. Eager-to-please Roger, pining for his '
            'family and stony broke, is coerced to take part in a seance in '
            'West Ruislip, an Albanian gambling ring in a Wiltshire abattoir, '
            'and finally a donkey trek across China disguised as a UN '
            'diplomat. All end violently badly for our hapless hero, while '
            'false friend Brian makes himself scarce. There’s pleasure to be '
            'had here, in Peacock and co-writer Dan Skinner’s ear for the '
            'bathos of their characters’ compromised lives, in which a '
            'regional manager job at Ask Pizza is the zenith of glamour. In '
            'Skinner’s performance, Roger’s pathetic pluck in the face of '
            'adversity and his never-quite-strong-enough efforts to resist '
            'Brian’s manipulation are beautifully played. They do get '
            'repetitive though, just as Brian’s cartoonish selfishness and '
            'cynicism give Simon Lipkin (stepping into Peacock’s role) only a '
            'couple of dimensions to play with. None of that’s a problem in a '
            'comic podcast, but a play needs more. Director David Babani tries '
            'to supply it, opening up space around the restricting convention '
            'of Brian and Roger’s phone messages with impressive digital '
            'backdrops (video design by Timothy Bird). In lieu of character '
            'progression, events become increasingly manic and overblown as '
            'the play progresses, leaving its most fertile dramatic terrain – '
            'the everyday poignancy of the two divorcees’ lives – in its wake. '

{'article': 'Last week the government finally published its proposals on how '
            'it intends to ban the degrading practice of so-called “conversion '
            'therapy”. It has taken years of lobbying, several high-profile '
            'resignations, as well as various statements from senior religious '
            'leaders and indeed whole denominations – such as the Church of '
            'England and the Methodist church – to get us to this point. Was '
            'it worth the wait? In truth there is much in the proposals that '
            'can and should be welcomed. The government has shown willing to '
            'listen to the senior human rights lawyers behind the Cooper '
            'report, which I convened, and has accepted our proposal of a '
            'two-pronged approach involving both criminal and civil remedies. '
            'This means that as well as clear criminal sanctions against '
            'perpetrators, who now face sentence of up to five years and a '
            'hefty fine, it will also introduce new protection orders that '
            'will work to safeguard young vulnerable LGBT+ people from harm. '
            'That is, if you are under 18 or have been found to have been '
            'forced or coerced into conversion therapy. But this restriction, '
            'focusing purely on the under-18s, is woefully inadequate and '
            'leaves thousands still open to abuse, particularly in religious '
            'settings – which the government’s own research has shown accounts '
            'for the majority of conversion practices. The new law would still '
            'allow adults to freely seek out such therapies. However, we know '
            'that it is young adults (aged 18-24) who are vulnerable to '
            'significant risk when they leave home and find themselves wooed '
            'by fundamentalist religious groups. So why has the government '
            'left this major loophole? I think, sadly, it is for the same '
            'reason that it has taken so many years to formulate this '
            'legislation: it does not want to offend a small minority of '
            'rightwing evangelicals within its party who want to be able to '
            'continue these barbaric practices of “praying the gay (and trans) '
            'away”. As someone who underwent nearly 20 years of conversion '
            'therapy, which resulted in me being hospitalised twice, I find '
            'this utterly unforgivable. The current proposals to allow adults '
            'to give “informed consent” would not have protected me, nor '
            'indeed the thousands of others like me who willingly undertook '
            'conversion therapy because we believed it was the right thing to '
            'do. Indeed, everyone we knew believed it was the right thing to '
            'do. To not go through it would have meant being ostracised by all '
            'those around us whom we loved and respected. I believed my '
            'desires to be sinful and was told that they must have arisen as a '
            'result of some deep trauma or unhealthy relationship with one of '
            'my family members. As a result, I put myself through years of '
            '“healing prayer” ministry, sharing some of my most intimate '
            'moments and relationships with strangers in the hope that we '
            'might “find the key” as to why I was attracted to women. I was '
            'constantly told that my prayers were unanswered because of my '
            'lack of faith, or that I obviously was not walking a godly enough '
            'path. Part of the trauma of these abusive practices is that you, '
            'the victim, are always left with the burden of being told it is '
            'your fault that you are not healed. I went on to seek other forms '
            'of spiritual counselling, including many exorcisms – paying '
            'thousands of pounds in the process. Years of shame, guilt and '
            'loneliness were then added to an increasing belief that God had '
            'deserted me. It was a living hell. I am a relatively strong '
            'person, and it nearly broke me – sadly many others are not so '
            'lucky, and tragically come to a point of believing that the only '
            'way out is to take their lives. That’s why conversion practices '
            'need to be banned outright, with no exceptions. That’s also why '
            'these rightwing evangelicals need to be held accountable for the '
            'trauma they cause. The government has sadly prioritised listening '
            'to their voices over those of survivors and has been oblivious to '
            'the mounting evidence of the harm that these religious practices '
            'inflict. The government needs to think again. First, it must '
            'learn from the experiences of survivors and prioritise their '
            'concerns, for we are the true experts. We know better than anyone '
            'what needs to be banned, and how best to do this. Two short '
            'meetings with the ministers for equalities – the sum total of '
            'their direct engagement with survivors – will never get to the '
            'bottom of this; nor will trying to “balance” our views with those '
            'who have caused us such harm, and who want to continue doing so. '
            'There is no middle road here: one needs to either protect people '
            'from harm or leave the door open to abuse. We cannot have another '
            'consultation that seeks to legitimise the concerns of those who '
            'are determined to continue with these degrading practices. '
            'Second, the government needs to listen to the senior human rights '
            'lawyers who have set out in the Cooper report why religious '
            'freedoms can and must be limited when significant harm is being '
            'caused. It should follow their recommendations on how best to do '
            'this: by focusing on practices that have the “predetermined '
            'purpose” of trying to change, “cure” or suppress a person’s '
            'sexual orientation or gender identity. It must also take on board '
            'their arguments about why “informed consent” for adults cannot be '
            'a defence in law when so many people’s health, wellbeing and '
            'indeed their very lives are at risk. That is why we do not allow '
            'for consent to female genital mutilation or forced marriage, or '
            'even such everyday matters as wearing a seatbelt. Finally, it '
            'must listen to the religious leaders from around the world who '
            'have also come together to ask their governments to ban this '
            'abhorrent practice. This will also enable those leaders to work '
            'within their organisations to ensure that it is ultimately '
            'stamped out. The government cannot afford to get this wrong – too '
            'many lives are quite literally at stake. My hope and prayer is '
            'that it will, finally, listen and recognise that outlawing '
            'conversion therapy can never have get-out clauses. Anything else '
            'is a ban in name only. Jayne Ozanne is director of Ozanne '

{'article': 'Jacob Rees-Mogg has questioned the fairness of the Conservative '
            'MP Owen Paterson facing a six-week suspension from parliament and '
            'possible byelection, after he was found to have committed an '
            '“egregious” breach of lobbying rules. Rees-Mogg, who is leader of '
            'the Commons, raised concerns about the investigation, and '
            'expressed sympathy with Paterson’s complaint that 17 witnesses '
            'who wanted to speak in his favour were not able to give oral '
            'evidence. Ahead of a vote on whether to enforce the suspension '
            'recommended by parliament’s standards commissioner and committee, '
            'Rees-Mogg kept open the possibility the government could whip '
            'Tory MPs to reduce or cut it completely. “It is always very '
            'important that systems appear to be fair, and therefore if '
            'somebody has witnesses, it would normally appear to be fair that '
            'those witnesses should be heard,” he said on his regular '
            'ConservativeHome podcast. He said the standards commissioner – '
            'Kathryn Stone – could have appointed a senior legal figure to '
            'help in the investigation, and added: “Many people have been '
            'raising with me recently questions about the process that '
            'affected Owen Paterson.” Paterson has tried to dismiss the '
            'propriety of the two-year investigation into his business links '
            'with Randox and Lynn’s Country Foods, claiming it was not '
            'compliant with natural justice because he was acting as a '
            'whistleblower and that the anguish played a “major role” in '
            'driving his wife, Rose, to suicide last summer. Part of '
            'Paterson’s complaint was that investigators declined to take oral '
            'evidence from 17 witnesses who wanted to speak in his support. '
            'The standards committee – on which several Tory MPs sit – said '
            'the witnesses wanted to talk about their perception of Paterson’s '
            'motivations, which would not substantially alter the facts about '
            'what rules had been broken. It added: “We do not see what further '
            'relevant information could usefully be gleaned by inviting oral '
            'evidence from the witnesses concerned.” Rees-Mogg said: “That is '
            'an interesting view to come to, because other people might say: '
            '‘How do you know whether it was relevant to the inquiry until '
            'you’ve taken their evidence and have found out the precise '
            'context of how things were done?’” Asked if Stone was mistaken, '
            'Rees-Mogg said he did not want to “prejudge” how MPs would vote '
            'on Wednesday. He confirmed that the motion to suspend Paterson '
            'would be amendable, meaning his supporters may choose to try to '
            'reduce the punishment, and left open the possibility Tory whips '
            'may instruct MPs to support such a move. Rees-Mogg said: “The '
            'government always has a responsibility to ensure that '
            'parliamentary business is dealt with efficiently, in a timely '
            'manner, and that the reputation of parliament and the government '
            'is upheld in all senses. Therefore, applying whips to individual '
            'votes – however serious they are – is perfectly reasonable.” '
            'Boris Johnson’s spokesman declined to say whether the prime '
            'minister sympathised with Rees-Mogg’s criticisms of the '
            'investigation into Paterson’s conduct. Asked about the comments '
            'by the leader of the house, he said: “This is a detailed report, '
            'a 175-page report, with complex issues and evidence which need to '
            'be looked at carefully. As the commission’s remit doesn’t look at '
            'the conduct of government ministers, I can’t comment any '
            'further.” “This is a matter for MPs,” the spokesman added. He '
            'also declined to say whether or how Johnson would vote on the '
            'sanctions against Paterson, saying only: “We’ll have to get to '
            'tomorrow.” Chris Bryant, the chair of the standards committee, '
            'said it “considered Paterson’s complaints about the process and '
            'rebutted each of his points in the report”, and added: “In the '

            'north-west London, and went into bushes where the women had been '
            'left by their satanist-obsessed killer. The officer took out a '
            'mobile phone and took pictures of the bodies. He sent four images '
            'to Lewis, who edited one of the photos and superimposed his face '
            'on to it with the two murdered women visible in the background. '
            'Lewis took other photos from the crime scene, which did not show '
            'the victims, and shared them with a group of more than 40 '
            'officers via WhatsApp who called themselves the “A-team”. The '
            'Independent Office for Police Conduct said Lewis had “used '
            'degrading and sexist language to describe the victims”. A '
            'spokesperson confirmed the remarks were directed at the murder '
            'victims and it was fair to characterise the remarks as insulting. '
            'Henry, a senior social worker, and Smallman, a photographer, had '
            'been celebrating the elder sister’s birthday in the park. After '
            'the celebration ended, they stayed behind and were attacked. They '
            'were reported missing the next day and a search by family and '
            'friends led to the partner of one of the sisters finding their '
            'bodies. The family of the murdered women were last week backed by '
            'the police watchdog in their claims the Met had let them down '
            'when the force failed to search for the two sisters after they '
            'went missing. The scandal, first revealed by the Guardian, has '
            'further blighted the Met’s reputation and the guilty pleas meant '
            'more detail about the officers’s actions were finally revealed. '
            'On Tuesday, the women’s mother, Mina Smallman, said the Met was '
            '“beyond hope” and called for its leaders to “get the rot out once '
            'and for all”. She accused the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, of '
            'a “shoddy way of behaving”. She said: “She has not contacted us '
            'to say ‘I am really sorry’. She has not spoken into this story at '
            'all. And it’s shameful that the IOPC [Independent Office for '
            'Police Conduct] had to tell the Met they should apologise to us '
            'in their failings for the missing persons [investigation]. Too '
            'little, too late. Too little, too late. “When I was in a senior '
            'position, if my organisation or department failed, it was on me. '
            'I had to take the can for it. Well, it’s now time for them to '
            'take the can for it. They are beyond hope.” The Guardian '
            'understands that Jaffer was a mentor for new recruits. The Met '
            'say he resigned in August and that he and Lewis will face a '
            'fast-track process to sack them. Jaffer, of Hornchurch in east '
            'London, and Lewis, from Colchester in Essex, were based with the '
            'Met’s North East Area Command. The judge told the men he viewed '
            'their offences as grave enough to merit lengthy imprisonment: '
            '“These matters are extremely serious and you should be under no '
            'illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you '
            'will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some '
            'length for your conduct.” The indictment says the offences took '
            'place between 7 June, the day the bodies were found, and 23 June '
            '2020. In a statement after the guilty pleas, the Crown '
            'Prosecution Service said: “PC Lewis edited one of the pictures by '
            'superimposing his own face on to the photograph with the victims '
            'in the background. He sent the resulting image to PC Jaffer, who '
            'then forwarded it unsolicited to a female officer also present at '
            'the scene. “PC Jaffer showed one of the photos of the victims to '
            'a male officer as they left the park. PC Lewis also shared '
            'photographs he had taken at the crime scene, which did not show '
            'the victims, with a WhatsApp group of 40-plus police officers '
            'called the A Team. “PC Jaffer, meanwhile, sent photographs of the '
            'victims to three friends via WhatsApp.” Dick said: “I deeply '
            'regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their '
            'loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced '
            'additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers. '
            'What former PC Jaffer and PC Lewis chose to do that day was '
            'utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive.” '
            'The officers will be sentenced at a later date and were granted '
            'bail. Danyal Hussein, who was 18 at the time, from Blackheath in '
            'south London, has been convicted of the murder of both sisters '
            'and jailed for life. The IOPC said that three officers who '
            'received the images but did not report them had a case to answer '
            'for misconduct.',

{'article': 'An international human rights investigation into the brutal civil '
            'war in Ethiopia’s Tigray province will be published on Wednesday '
            'amid concerns that the scope of the UN inquiry has been '
            'constrained by both Addis Ababa and the ongoing conflict. Due to '
            'be released almost exactly a year after the conflict began, the '
            'joint UN Human Rights Office and government-created Ethiopian '
            'Human Rights Commission (EHRC), will nevertheless be the most '
            'authoritative overview of the war and its consequences. '
            'Independent human rights groups, humanitarian organisations and '
            'foreign media are banned from Tigray, in a conflict where at '
            'least tens of thousands have died and there have been accusations '
            'of sexual violence and deliberate starvation. Investigators were '
            'allowed to visit Tigray however, because of the partnership with '
            'the EHRC – but were not able to visit all key locations, '
            'including the site of an alleged massacre in Axum in November '
            '2020 by Eritrean troops fighting alongside the Ethiopian '
            'government.\n'
            'The involvement of the EHRC has left Tigrayan leaders sceptical '
            'about the investigation’s independence – while the conflict, '
            'which saw much of Tigray recaptured by rebels over the summer, '
            'has created further difficulties. David Crane, the founder of the '
            'Global Accountability Network and founding chief prosecutor for '
            'the special court for Sierra Leone, an international tribunal, '
            'said: “What you need when you go into an atrocity zone is a clean '
            'slate so outside investigators can look into it neutrally, '
            'dispassionately. “You want to do these things where you don’t '
            'build doubt, distrust from the beginning,” including among people '
            'interviewed, he added. Ethiopia expelled seven senior UN '
            'officials last month, including the human rights officer Sonny '
            'Onyegbula, who was working on the report. Addis Ababa accused the '
            'officials of “meddling in internal affairs”. Rising tensions '
            'between the Ethiopian government led by Abiy Ahmed and the '
            'Tigrayan TPLF, previously the dominant group in the country’s '
            'politics, led to the start of fighting in November 2020. '
            'Initially, Ethiopia, in alliance with neighbouring Eritrea, '
            'seized control of Tigray, amid multiple reports of atrocities. '
            'Tigrayan forces regrouped and staged a counterattack, regaining '
            'much of Tigray in June and capturing parts of neighbouring '
            'provinces. Despite a recent counterattack by Ethiopian forces in '
            'October, the TPLF claims to have gained further ground, seizing '
            'strategic towns on the road to Addis, prompting speculation that '
            'the capital itself could fall to the rebels. In a sign of '
            'paranoia around the fate of Addis Ababa, state media called on '
            'Monday for residents to register weapons in the next two days. On '
            'Sunday, Ahmed called for citizens to “use any type of weapons to '
            'block the destructive [rebel push], to overturn it and bury it”. '
            '“Dying for Ethiopia is a duty for all of us,” he said. The rights '
            'report only covers the period from November 2020 to 28 June 2021, '
            'when the TPLF recaptured Mekelle, the province’s capital, and is '
            'based on 269 interviews with victims and witnesses, as well as '
            'with other sources. Some involved in the investigation told the '
            'Associated Press that the head of the EHRC, Daniel Bekele, '
            'underplayed some allegations that fighters from the country’s '
            'Amhara region were responsible for abuses and pressed to '
            'highlight abuses by Tigray forces. But Bekele asserted the '
            'commission’s independence, saying it was “primarily accountable '
            'to the people it is created to serve” and that he and the '
            'commission had consistently cited “serious indications that all '
            'parties involved in the conflict have committed atrocities”. '
            'Bekele also said the investigation lacked the support of the '
            'Tigray authorities now administering the region. The UN has said '
            'Ethiopia’s government had no say in the report’s publication, '
            'though it was given the chance to read it in advance and to point '
            'out “anything it believes to be incorrect”. It has acknowledged '
            'there have been difficulties in accessing key locations. Last '
            'week, Ethiopia’s government released the results of its own '
            'investigations focusing on alleged abuses by Tigray forces. The '
            'ministry of justice said it found 483 non-combatants were killed '
            'and 109 raped in parts of Amhara and Afar that have been '
            'recaptured by federal forces in recent weeks. The spokesperson '
            'for the Tigray forces, Getachew Reda, said the allegations were '
            'not worth “the paper they’re written on”. Accusations of rapes '
            'and killings by Tigray forces are “absolutely untrue, at least on '
            'a level these organisations are alleging,” he said.',

{'article': 'A small group of Ethiopian and Eritrean men stand shoeless and '
            'shivering in Calais. A few hours earlier, they almost drowned in '
            'the Channel, trying to cross to the UK. They got into difficulty '
            'when the motor on their boat failed. Their jeans are stiff and '
            'sodden with sand and seawater. “We called the French coastguard '
            'to rescue us but they told us to call the English coastguard,” '
            'says one man. “Eventually, the French rescued us and brought us '
            'back to Calais. “I studied political science at university in my '
            'country and I want to work and contribute in the UK. I do not '
            'know what I can do now. I can’t go back and I can’t go forward. '
            'There is a lot of racism in this situation. We need to find '
            'peace. If we have no peace we have no life.” Five years ago this '
            'week, workers dressed in orange jumpsuits and white hard hats '
            'came with sledgehammers and diggers to demolish the refugee camp '
            'that had been dubbed “the Jungle” by the migrants living there in '
            'this city on the northern French coast. The squalid 1.5 sq mile '
            '(3.9 sq km) area of scrubland had become a symbol of Europe’s '
            'migration crisis after more than 1 million desperate people – '
            'many escaping the conflict in Syria – fled to Europe by sea '
            'during 2015, according to UNHCR data.\n'
            'Migrants and police at the ‘Old Lidl’ site in Calais. The police '
            'clear the site regularly, evicting anyone living there and '
            'seizing remaining belongings. Today, the Jungle has gone, but the '
            'migrants remain – a report from Human Rights Watch, using data '
            'from local charities, estimates there are still about 2,000 '
            'migrants “in wooded areas, in and around disused warehouses, and '
            'under bridges in and around Calais”, including about 300 '
            'unaccompanied children. Several hundred more are camped in a '
            'forest near Dunkirk. The migrants waiting in these areas are at '
            'the centre of a political storm. In the UK, the home secretary’s '
            'draconian nationality and borders bill, which includes plans to '
            'punish asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats with a '
            'jail sentence and a ban on receiving state funds, looms on the '
            'horizon. There is growing hostility to the migrants on the French '
            'side, too, with police in Calais daily evicting the threadbare '
            'camps that replaced the Jungle. Authorities have even installed '
            'large rocks and boulders at some of the regular distribution '
            'points to prevent aid vans parking. Brexit has slowed shipments '
            'of clothing and other essential items. On a patch of bare ground '
            'known as “Old Lidl” – it was once the site of a Lidl store – '
            'dozens of young men, mostly Sudanese, gather to replenish their '
            'water supplies and charge their phones via large portable power '
            'banks.\n'
            'A man sits alone on the former site of the Jungle. They laugh and '
            'joke, but they look tired, lines prematurely etched in some of '
            'their young faces – and all are underweight, baggy jeans flapping '
            'around their legs. One of them leads us to a small area of '
            'woodland where a group of young men are sleeping in a clearing, '
            'surrounded by rubbish. One is dozing in an open cardboard box; '
            'another is lying on the ground with his legs covered in blankets. '
            'He says he is struggling to walk because he was beaten badly by '
            'the police. “Our routine is the same every day and every night,” '
            'says a third man. “We try and sleep a bit during the day if we '
            'can. Then we go to bed about 8pm. At midnight every night we wake '
            'up and try to cross the Channel. We try to find a boat we can '
            'cross in ourselves because we don’t have the money to pay the '
            'smugglers. Usually we don’t succeed. We hurry back here by 6am so '
            'we can hide our few belongings before the police come to evict us '
            'every morning. Then the same cycle starts again.”\n'
            'The migrants here – from Sudan, Eritrea, Kurdistan and more '
            'recently Vietnam (who are said to be accompanied by traffickers) '
            'are undeterred in their plans to seek safety in the UK. The '
            'number of asylum applications in Britain fell in 2020 to 29,456 '
            '(significantly lower than the 93,475 asylum applications made in '
            'France and the 121,955 in Germany). However, migrant small boat '
            'crossings from northern France to the UK are at record levels. '
            'These Sudanese young men are gloomy about their chances of '
            'reaching the UK. One, who came here via Libya, shows us a '
            'photograph on his phone of a 16-year-old boy known as Yasser, '
            'also Sudanese, who died on 28 September trying to board a truck '
            'at Calais. He had hoped he could secretly reach the UK by '
            'clinging on to the vehicle. “He was my friend,” says the young '
            'man showing the boy’s photo. “He was so small. Like the rest of '
            'us, all he wanted was to live in a safe place. We call Priti '
            'Patel ‘Madame No’ because she won’t allow us to do this.”\n'
            'Several hundred migrants are camped in a forest near Dunkirk. The '
            'squalid conditions will only become worse in winter. The French '
            'media has reported a second similar death of a young migrant '
            'trying to board a truck to the UK on 21 October. “The only thing '
            'in our lives now is to get across the Channel,” the young man '
            'continues. “My hair has grown long. I have said I will not cut it '
            'until I reach the UK.” This desperation is just as palpable in '
            'neighbouring Dunkirk. The Grande-Synthe camp here is home to '
            'several hundred migrants, many of whom are Kurdish. They, too, '
            'have endured difficult journeys – some spent years stuck in camps '
            'in Greece. When we visit, the sun is shining and the autumn air '
            'is still warm in the forest area where the camp is based. The mud '
            'paths are dry now, but when the rain and snow come the area will '
            'be treacherous to navigate. Refugee barbers trim the hair of '
            'friends and family members, unofficial shopkeepers sell soft '
            'drinks on folding tables and Kurdish music blares. This group is '
            'more likely to have the money to pay smugglers, so tend to spend '
            'shorter periods of time here before crossing to the UK – some '
            'have enough money to buy a few essentials from the nearby '
            'supermarket.\n'
            'Charities including Care 4 Calais (top) and Refugee Info Bus '
            '(bottom) provide migrants with food, water, clothing and phone '
            'charging services. However, the funder Choose Love is due to stop '
            'financing at least seven local charities. Navid, a Kurd who '
            'speaks perfect English, was forced to flee Iran after he took '
            'part in protests against the government, an action which is '
            'punishable by death, and was called to appear in court. “I '
            'studied mechanical engineering at one of the best universities in '
            'Iran,” he says. “I travelled through nine countries to get here; '
            'a lot of the time I was walking. The journey took months. I hope '
            'I can cross the Channel to the UK soon. We are refugees. We have '
            'no other way.” One woman from Eritrea sits in the mud with her '
            'five-month-old baby. Her two older children play nearby. Like '
            'many, she is fleeing more than one problem. She escaped Eritrea '
            'as a child with her family and grew up in Sudan, a country she '
            'eventually had to escape from, too, arriving in Germany where she '
            'sought sanctuary. She married a man there who became increasingly '
            'violent and threatening, forcing her to run once again, this time '
            'with three young children in tow. “Everything is shit,” she says. '
            '“I have no other words to describe my situation.” While '
            'anti-migrant groups and politicians crank up the pressure on '
            'Patel to take a tough line on those trying to reach the UK, human '
            'rights campaigners say the home secretary’s plans to make Channel '
            'crossings “unviable” is simply putting more lives at risk – as '
            'desperate people have little other choice but to attempt to cross '
            'regardless.\n'
            'Two migrants who spoke to the Guardian. The man on the right had '
            'tried to cross the Channel the night before. For those migrants '
            'here who are still waiting to get across, their precarious '
            'situation is expected to deteriorate. Choose Love, a major '
            'funder, is due to stop financing at least seven local charities '

            'part in state corruption, refused, and had to flee. He crossed '

{'article': 'Australia has more than 100 fossil fuel developments in the '
            'pipeline that could result in nearly 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse '
            'gases a year – equivalent to about 5% of global industrial '
            'emissions – if all were to go ahead, an analysis says. The '
            'Australian government lists 116 major coal and gas projects under '
            'development, each valued at more than A$50m and with the '
            'potential to reach a final investment decision in the next five '
            'years. Not all will be built, but a new report says it is an '
            'indication of the fossil fuel development that continues in '
            'Australia, including with taxpayer support, despite the Morrison '
            'government committing to net zero emissions by 2050. Launching a '
            'plan for the country to reach the target last week ahead of the '
            'Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, the prime minister, Scott '
            'Morrison, said the government would “not shut down our coal or '
            'gas production”. The plan said the country’s fossil fuel export '
            'industries would continue “through to 2050 and beyond, supporting '
            'jobs and regional communities”. Angus Taylor, the emissions '
            'reduction minister, has also promised to use Cop26 to promote '
            'Australia as a safe and reliable place to invest in gas and '
            'hydrogen.\n'
            'An analysis by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, '
            'found the most recent data from the energy and resources '
            'department’s chief economist, published last December, listed 72 '
            'coal and 44 gas and oil projects with the potential to be '
            'developed. The institute also included the proposed Beetaloo '
            'Basin gas field in the Northern Territory, which the government '
            'has committed up to $224m to develop as part of what it calls a '
            '“gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic. Based on the estimated '
            'annual capacity of each proposal, it found together they could '
            'add about 146m tonnes to emissions within Australia (equivalent '
            'to a nearly 30% annual increase) during extraction and '
            'processing. The overwhelming bulk of the emissions – about 1.6bn '
            'tonnes – would be released offshore after the coal and gas was '
            'sold and burned for energy. About two-thirds of the coal projects '
            'were listed as at feasibility stage. Government officials noted '
            'there was a growing preference for mine expansions over '
            'greenfield projects and that some lenders and investors would no '
            'longer finance thermal coal, which is used in electricity '
            'generation. Richie Merzian, a former Australian government '
            'climate negotiator now with the Australia Institute, said the '
            'country continued to pursue an aggressive expansion of fossil '
            'fuels with potential emissions on the list equivalent to more '
            'than 200 coal-fired power plants. “Australia cannot claim to be '
            'acting on climate change while simultaneously expanding fossil '
            'fuel projects,” he said. The Morrison government’s position on '
            'fossil fuels is that cost and global markets will dictate the '
            'pace of the shift to cleaner technology. It has approved the '
            'expansion of four coalmines since September and in July granted a '
            '$175m loan for a new metallurgical coalmine in Queensland. On '
            'gas, it has said it hoped to develop four more basins after '
            'Beetaloo. State and territory governments under both the '
            'Coalition and Labor also back fossil fuel expansion. Hugh '
            'Saddler, an energy analyst and an honorary associate professor at '
            'the Australian National University, said the federal government '
            'was “just plugging on absolutely business-as-usual” on fossil '
            'fuels. “There’s been no thought about how you fit that into some '
            'supposed plan to reach net zero by 2050,” he said. “We know the '
            'important thing to stop the most catastrophic climate change is '
            'to stop fossil fuels, but Australia is putting its foot on the '
            'accelerator to develop coal and gas as quickly as it can and '
            'putting taxpayers’ dollars into doing that.”\n'
            'The government’s 2050 net zero emissions plan has been criticised '
            'for not including new policies and relying on new technology to '
            'make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the 2030s and 40s. '
            'It says it is committing $20bn over a decade to help lower the '
            'cost of some technologies. Most of the spending is a continuation '
            'of long-standing funding for clean energy agencies. The '
            'government has backed carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology '
            '– burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres '
            'underground – to extend their life, and committed $250m to a “CCS '
            'technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have '
            'previously committed about $4bn in funding for CCS, but it has '
            'failed to prove commercially viable. The country has one '
            'operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in '
            'Western Australia. It has suffered delays and operational '
            'problems, and captures only a portion of the emissions at the '
            'site. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '

            'The gas company Santos confirmed on Monday it would proceed with '
            'a $220m CCS development at the Moomba gas reservoir in South '
            'Australia after the Morrison government approved it to earn '
            'revenue from carbon credits for storing emissions below ground. '
            'Santos said the project could store 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide '
            'a year from 2024. The gas industry group, the Australian '
            'Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the '
            'Australia Institute’s analysis should not be considered '
            '“objective, scientific or reasonable” as the thinktank had made '
            'its opposition to the industry “very clear”. Its chief executive, '
            'Andrew McConville, said it would be more constructive for people '
            'to listen to those that had recognised gas had a role to play in '
            'a low-emissions future, including the International Energy '
            'Agency, the United Nations, and Australia’s former chief '
            'scientist Alan Finkel. Some have backed gas – which has about '
            'half the emissions of coal when burned, and more when methane '
            'leaks during extraction – as playing an ongoing role as the world '
            'moves away from coal, but few have backed opening new gas '
            'fields.\n'
            'The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, earlier '
            'this year said there should be “no new investments in oil, gas '
            'and coal from now” if governments were serious about the climate '
            'crisis. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday said '
            'Australia had to “face up to the fact that we’ve got to stop '
            'burning coal and gas”. “The proposition that seems to be '
            'fashionable in some quarters here that we can keep on burning '
            'coal, and indeed exporting coal, and that somehow is consistent '
            'with getting to net zero by 2050, is nonsense,” he told the ABC’s '
            'RN Breakfast. “The reality is if we keep burning fossil fuels we '
            'will fry the planet.”',

            'yellow, blue and red spiders, in scenes residents say bring to '
            'mind the movie Arachnophobia.\n'
            'The Joro spider is an invasive species, native to east Asia, that '
            'was first spotted in Georgia in 2014. Since then, the 3in '
            'arachnid appears to have thrived in the warm climes of the state. '
            'Its presence has upset locals, however, particularly given its '
            'propensity to spin dense webs up to 3 metres deep. Jennifer '
            'Turpin, a self-described arachnophobe who lives in Atlanta, told '
            'the Associated Press she stopped blowing leaves in her yard after '
            'walking into a Joro web. Turpin, 50, said she tried to set a web '
            'on fire but became concerned the web would fall on her. She '
            'swiftly backpedaled, only to fall into a hole. Turpin asked a '
            'neighbor remove the spider. “I just don’t think I’m going to do '
            'yard work any more,” Turpin said. Debbie Gilbert, from Norcross, '
            '20 miles north-east of Atlanta, was also forced to take matters '
            'into her own hands. She said she uses a stick to wind up the '
            'webs, before tossing it, spiders and all, to the ground. The '
            '67-year-old then stomped on the spiders, she said. “I don’t '
            'advocate killing anything,” Gilbert said. “I live in peace with '
            'all the spiders around here and everything else. But [Joros] just '
            'don’t belong here, that’s all.” Joro spiders, or Trichonephila '
            'clavata, are common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. It is '
            'unclear how they made their way to the US. Researchers say the '
            'particular abundance of the spiders this year could be down to '
            'changes in weather. It is unclear whether the spider will have a '
            'negative impact on native flora and fauna, as do other invasive '
            'species, including the notorious spotted lanternfly. Ann Rypstra, '
            'who studies spider behavior at Miami University, told the AP more '
            'research was needed. “I’d always err on the side of caution when '
            'you have something that establishes itself where it’s not '
            'supposed to be,” she said. In the meantime, people across north '
            'Georgia are trying to come to terms with their new neighbours. In '
            'Winterville, Will Hudson’s front porch became unusable amid an '
            'abundance of Joro webs 10ft deep. An entomologist at the '
            'University of Georgia, he said that he had killed more than 300 '
            'of the spiders. “The webs are a real mess,” Hudson said. “Nobody '
            'wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps '
            'and get a face full of spider web.” Hudson said that though the '
            'spiders can bite, they are not a threat to humans. A researcher '
            'collecting them with her bare hands reported the occasional '
            'pinch, he said, but said the spiders never broke her skin. “Last '
            'year there were dozens of spiders, and they began to be something '
            'of a nuisance when I was doing yard work,” Hudson said. “This '
            'year, I have several hundred, and they actually make the place '
            'look spooky with all the messy webs – like a scene out of '

{'article': 'Antonio Conte believes he can end a 13-year trophy drought at '
            'Tottenham. He has not said so publicly just yet, but this is a '
            'man who has described the pursuit of victory as “an obsession, a '
            'drug”. When Conte joined Internazionale in 2019, he told the '
            'Italian edition of GQ magazine: “I can accept having only a small '
            'chance of winning at the start, even just 1%, but there has to be '
            'at least that much.”\n'
            'The Nerazzurri were nine years removed from their last Serie A '
            'title. Conte needed only two to put them back on top. In his '
            'first season at San Siro, Inter improved by 13 points and reached '
            'the Europa League final. A year later, they were champions of '
            'Italy, sealing their title with four games to spare. Even that '
            'was slow going by the manager’s standards. At his two previous '
            'clubs, Conte won at the first attempt. Juventus finished seventh '
            'in consecutive seasons before he arrived in 2011 and led them to '
            'the Scudetto without defeat. Chelsea were the Premier League’s '
            '10th-best team under José Mourinho and Guus Hiddink in 2015-16, '
            'then champions with Conte in 2016-17. This is the Italian’s '
            'brand: a man who just wins, wherever he goes. A “guarantee”, as '
            'he has often been defined by pundits in his home country, even '
            'though such terms make him bristle. As the one lifting the '
            'trophies, Conte is always quick to remind any interviewer that no '
            'victory is inevitable, and every result hard-earned.\n'
            'Winning at Inter was, in his perception, most difficult of all. '
            'The club’s identity seemed to exist in direct opposition to his '
            'own, and not only because he had spent so much of his career '
            'working for Juventus, a great rival. One of Conte’s first acts '
            'was to ban the playing of Pazza Inter before kick-off, a beloved '
            'anthem which calls on fans to embrace the “craziness” and '
            'unpredictability of their team. That trait was always overstated. '
            'Inter had won 18 league titles before Conte arrived – a figure '
            'only Juventus could better. They had underachieved heavily in the '
            'decade since winning the treble under Mourinho, however, '
            'routinely finishing outside the top four despite one of the '
            'highest wage bills in Serie A. Throughout his tenure, Conte '
            'repeated that his first objective was to make Inter “credible” '
            'again. Perhaps that would be an appropriate starting point at '
            'Tottenham. In the past two years the club has gone backwards, '
            'from a Champions League final to the Europa Conference League, '
            'via an Amazon Prime documentary series and a 3-0 humiliation in '
            'Zagreb.\n'
            'Those unfamiliar with Conte’s mindset might ask why he would '
            'consider taking on the team in their present state. A man who has '
            'won league titles in five out of his past seven seasons of club '
            'management could doubtless have landed a more comfortable '
            'position if he had chosen to wait. The prospect of a year out '
            'will not have daunted him. Conte took a sabbatical in 2018-19 '
            'after he parted company with Chelsea. Although “the need to work '
            'hard is in my DNA”, he confessed to enjoying the opportunity to '
            'be with family and swim in “my sea” where he grew up in Puglia. '
            'This summer his social media was awash with pictures of him '
            'revisiting those waters.\n'
            'If anything, it may be the scale of the challenge at Tottenham '
            'that has intrigued him. “I like putting myself in play,” Conte '
            'has said. “Inter were the extreme limit of this approach. I had a '
            'lot to lose. But I have a hard head, so I press forward, ready to '
            'knock down walls with this head of mine.” Equally, though, he is '
            'not a man to charge in without assessing the scale of the '
            'challenge. The fact that Conte was available is testament to his '
            'unwillingness to work in conditions he considers unfavourable. He '
            'left Inter because he did not believe he could build on his '
            'successes while the club sought to slash 20% from its wage bill.\n'
            'What assurances has he received from his former Juventus '
            'colleague Fabio Paratici, the managing director of football at '
            'Spurs? It is easy to imagine Conte being enticed by the '
            'opportunity to work with Harry Kane, whom he described in 2017 as '
            '“one of the best strikers in the world”. Yet the player has '
            'struggled for form this season after being denied a move. '
            'Tottenham may view Conte as a good bet to help the striker get '
            'back to his best. The manager found the right buttons to press '
            'with another brilliant No 9, Romelu Lukaku, who produced the best '
            'football of his career at Inter, piling up 47 goals and 13 '
            'assists in two Serie A seasons while adding almost 50% to his '
            'market value.\n'
            'That was not his first success story with a tall and physical '
            'centre-forward. Graziano Pellè went beyond the limits that most '
            'imagined for him while wearing an Italy shirt under Conte, and '
            'Diego Costa scored 20 times to fire Chelsea to the Premier League '
            'title in 2017, even if the relationship did break down '
            'immediately afterwards. Certainly, it is easy to imagine how Kane '
            'and Son Heung-min would dovetail well at the top of Conte’s '
            'preferred 3-5-2. The summer loan signing Cristian Romero could '
            'also benefit from returning to such a system, playing between two '
            'other centre-backs as he did at Atalanta. What guarantees, '
            'though, have Tottenham offered to Conte? He has always demanded '
            'that clubs who employ him match his ambition with investment. He '
            'left Juventus after infamously suggesting that nobody should '
            'expect to eat in a €100 restaurant for €10. He blamed a '
            'disappointing second season at Chelsea on the club’s failure to '
            'deliver him Lukaku and Virgil van Dijk. His critics will accuse '
            'him of always wanting more, pointing out the many players signed '
            'to support his vision at both clubs. In Italy it did not escape '
            'anyone’s attention that Inter found their best form last season '
            'after a January in which financial constraints prevented them '
            'from making any moves. The manager was obliged to work on getting '
            'the most from players who had been marginalised, including the '
            'former Tottenham man Christian Eriksen. What Conte wants and what '
            'he needs to succeed may be two different things, yet it seems '
            'inconceivable that a man with his CV and personality would take '
            'any job on somebody else’s terms. He believes he can win trophies '
            'at a club where Mourinho, Mauricio Pochettino and André '
            'Villas-Boas failed to do so. The least that Conte will expect '
            'from Spurs is to share in his vision for how that can be '
            'achieved.',

{'article': 'The trickiest job in New Zealand? It used to be generally '
            'accepted that even the prime minister had it easier than the '
            'incumbent All Blacks head coach. Now, though, there is a third '
            'contender, requiring the former’s diplomatic touch and the '
            'latter’s survival instincts. To be NZ Rugby’s chief executive at '
            'this juncture in rugby history is to be caught between the devil '
            'and the deep blue Pacific. Put yourself in Mark Robinson’s '
            'jandals for a second. On the one hand he presides over the most '
            'marketable national team in the world, which is not the worst '
            'gig. On the other he represents a country at odds over whether a '
            'chunk of NZ Rugby’s commercial operations should be sold to a '
            'US-based private equity firm. Squaring that contradictory circle '
            '– “rugby means an awful lot to our country’s identity and psyche” '
            '– will define Robinson’s stewardship, with significant '
            'implications for every other rugby-playing country in the world.\n'
            'Because, make no mistake, these are critical weeks and months for '
            'rugby’s global commercial future. As with the climate emergency '
            'the clock is ticking and, having talked to various other senior '
            'officials over the weekend, the urgency and tension is mounting. '
            '“It has to happen now,” said one, referring to the renewed push '
            'to agree a streamlined global fixture calendar. “A lot of unions '
            'are hurting at the moment.” The upshot is that everyone, not '
            'least New Zealand, will need to embrace people and/or rival '
            'unions they have often treated with a mixture of scepticism or '
            'indifference. During the era of the previous NZ Rugby chief '
            'executive, Steve Tew, the All Blacks’ attitude was mostly a '
            'blunt: ‘Take it or leave it.’ Encouraged by cash-strapped '
            'European nations to fly north outside the official window, they '
            'have long since hired themselves out at a punchy rate. Playing in '
            'Cardiff against a weakened Welsh side last Saturday, for example, '
            'was worth £2m to NZ Rugby, which may explain why the head coach, '
            'Ian Foster, took a potshot or two at the media for questioning '
            'the fixture’s legitimacy. Playing non-lucrative away Tests in the '
            'Pacific Islands, strangely, has tended to be less of a priority. '
            'It also says a fair amount about rugby’s uneasy north-south '
            'marriage that, outside World Cups, England have faced the All '
            'Blacks once in the past seven years, a 16-15 loss at Twickenham '
            'in 2018. This lack of mutual interaction has not benefited either '
            'party, nor updated age-old prejudices on both sides, while '
            'southern hemisphere players relocating to lucrative European or '
            'Japanese leagues remains another underlying source of friction. '
            'For many of the above reasons, the 47-year-old Robinson is an '
            'increasingly key figure. Having spoken to him twice in recent '
            'days, the first thing to say is he is far more approachable than '
            'his predecessor and many of those masquerading as European '
            'rugby’s biggest cheeses. The second is that, perhaps uniquely for '
            'a senior NZ Rugby administrator, he genuinely loves the UK. In '
            'addition to winning nine caps for the All Blacks, he studied at '
            'Cambridge University and shared in two winning Varsity matches in '
            'an era when the Light Blues won five years in a row.\n'
            'Twickenham, as a result, holds fond memories and he also used to '
            'play rugby in Taranaki with Beauden and Jordie Barrett’s father, '
            'Kevin. A good enough player to have been selected on a couple of '
            'occasions ahead of Tana Umaga in the All Blacks’ midfield, he '
            'featured in the same half-decent starting backline as Christian '
            'Cullen, Doug Howlett, Jonah Lomu and Andrew Mehrtens against '
            'France in 2002. Unusually for a leading administrator, he knows '
            'how it feels to tour around sodden, wintry European fields in the '
            'professional era with every opponent desperate to take a slice '
            'out of you. Had it not been for his studies and bad luck with '
            'injuries, he might have had an even more decorated career but, '
            'given his nicely balanced CV, you can understand why NZ Rugby '
            'anointed him as Tew’s successor just before the world shuttered '
            'up against Covid. Completing a deal with the US technology '
            'investment firm Silver Lake after the players’ union vetoed the '
            'initial $NZ387.5m offer remains a clear priority – “I wouldn’t be '
            'prepared to put a timescale on it but it’s heading in the right '
            'direction” – but ask what will happen if things go completely '
            'pear-shaped and his easy-going tone hardens slightly. “We’re not '
            'the kind or organisation that gives up easily. It’s the Kiwi way. '
            'We would keep searching for the opportunity. The game has many '
            'mouths to feed and we’ll have to find a way to keep doing that.” '
            'Robinson is also smart enough to understand that even the mighty '
            'All Blacks can not stand still in changing times. In an open '
            'letter to New Zealanders in May he did not mince his words, '
            'suggesting the traditional Kiwi rugby model “is broken” and '
            'urging supporters to embrace change. He would be instantly sacked '
            'for suggesting the national team should lose more often but knows '
            'that visiting the United States to consult NBA and NFL teams '
            'about commercial strategy and event management, as the All Blacks '
            'did last month, will be of limited value unless global rugby '
            'becomes collectively healthier.\n'
            'Thrashing the US Eagles 104-14 is unlikely to woo many casual '
            'American fans and the same two teams winning the past four World '
            'Cups does not offer a perfect future growth blueprint either. '
            '“What we want to see an international environment with a greater '
            'depth and breadth of talent and competition,” says Robinson. '
            '“That has to be a vision we all aspire to. We’re really '
            'interested in what the game can look like as more of a truly '
            'global sport.” It explains why NZ Rugby is right behind a World '
            'Cup in the US in 2031, will be in the (virtual) room this month '
            'for talks with representatives of all the major club leagues and '
            'will happily host a women’s Lions tour should the opportunity '
            'ever arise, not just to generate more income to fund their '
            'domestic grassroots but “to create more value across the whole '
            'rugby ecosystem”. Because even Robinson and his marketable All '
            'Blacks can sense the onrushing financial chill if rugby does not '
            'pull together now. “It’s an absolutely critical time,” he says. '
            '“We want to make sure as many rugby organisations can firstly '
            'survive and then look to create some models that can really help '
            'it thrive.\n'
            '“I am optimistic we can create something with a stronger '
            'narrative around the international game but it takes a lot of '
            'consultation, listening and hard work. I don’t think anyone’s too '
            'big, at the moment, to think they’re got the answers to '
            'everything.” • This is an extract from our rugby union email, the '

{'article': 'The US drugmaker Pfizer has lifted its 2021 forecast for revenues '
            'from its Covid vaccine to $36bn (£26.3bn), and forecast another '
            '$29bn sales next year after it started shipping booster jabs and '
            'shots for children. The Covid jab, called Comirnaty and developed '
            'with Germany’s BioNTech, contributed $13bn of revenues in the '
            'three months to 30 September. That was more than half of Pfizer’s '
            'total revenues of $24bn in the quarter, which rose 134% from a '
            'year earlier. In the first six months of the year, Corminaty '
            'revenues were $11.3bn. Pfizer, which shares profits on the Covid '
            'vaccine evenly with BioNTech, raised its 2021 forecast for '
            'Corminaty sales from $33.5bn in July, as it expects to deliver '
            '2.3bn doses this year. Together with BioNTech, it continues to '
            'expect to manufacture 3bn doses by the end of December, although '
            'not all of them will be delivered by then. For next year, it has '
            'so far agreed contracts for 1.7bn doses. The jab was the first to '
            'gain approval for emergency use in the US for adults last year, '
            'and more recently for children and booster shots. Together with '
            'the US biotech firm Moderna, Pfizer accounts for the lion’s share '
            'of the pharma industry’s global revenues from Covid vaccines. '
            'Many western countries including the US, UK and Germany have '
            'started giving third booster shots to elderly and vulnerable '
            'people. However, booster jabs are controversial because in '
            'low-income countries only 3.7% of people have received at least '
            'one dose of a Covid vaccine. About 7.1bn doses have been '
            'administered globally, and nearly half the world’s population has '
            'received at least one jab.\n'
            'The jump in Covid vaccine revenues prompted Pfizer to lift its '
            'overall sales and earnings predictions. It now expects to make '
            'total revenues of up to $82bn this year, and underlying earnings '
            'a share of $4.13 to $4.18, compared with its previous forecast of '
            '$3.95 to $4.05. Pfizer faced fresh criticism from groups such as '
            'Amnesty International. The campaign group Global Justice Now '
            'accused Pfizer of “making a killing” out of “the most lucrative '
            'medicine ever produced,” while “most of the world has been locked '
            'out of this vaccine”. Its director, Nick Dearden, said: “Just 1% '
            'of Pfizer’s supplies have been sold to the international '
            'distribution mechanism Covax, as the company has put sales of '
            'third and fourth doses in wealthy markets ahead of selling doses '
            'to where they’re most needed. This will undoubtedly prolong the '
            'pandemic.” Responding to criticism, Pfizer’s chief executive, '
            'Albert Bourla, said poorer countries and organisations such as '
            'Covax needed to place orders, at a heavily discounted price, '
            'adding: “We remain on track to achieve our goal of delivering at '
            'least 2bn doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of '
            '2022 – at least 1bn to be delivered this year and 1bn next year.” '
            'Bourla made a bold promise in June, saying that should the need '
            'arise for a new Covid vaccine, the company could develop one '
            'within 100 days. He was referring to the possible emergence of an '
            '“escape variant” – a strain of Sars-CoV-2 that evades the '
            'immunity provided by current vaccines and previous infections. '
            'Other companies, such as Moderna and AstraZeneca, are also '
            'preparing for the emergence of new strains by updating their '
            'current vaccines to match known variants such as delta, and '
            'testing them on these strains. These dress rehearsals are '
            'designed to even out kinks in the processes so the firms can move '
            'faster if an “escape variant” emerges for which current jabs do '
            'not work, Nature reported recently.',

{'article': 'The Labour party has called on the government and the EU to lift '
            'the “veil of secrecy” over the talks about new Brexit '
            'arrangements for Northern Ireland, urging them to give local '
            'political leaders a seat at the negotiations table. As the talks '
            'inch towards the deadline the UK government has set for making a '
            'decision to trigger article 16 and suspend parts of the protocol, '
            'the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said it was '
            'unsustainable for leaders, businesses and civic society to be '
            '“shut out” on huge decisions being taken about their future. She '
            'made her remarks as the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, revealed that '
            'the US president, Joe Biden, had pulled him aside after a formal '
            'Cop26 conference in Glasgow to tell him he was watching the '
            'Northern Ireland Brexit talks closely. “He called me aside after '
            'the meeting to, again, make it very clear to me that the United '
            'States takes the Good Friday agreement very seriously. To use his '
            'own words, ‘it matters greatly to me and to the United States’, '
            'and he said he has made this clear to the UK government.” '
            'Speaking at the start of October, the Brexit minister, David '
            'Frost, said the conflict over the protocol needed to be settled '
            'within three weeks, but last week he said significant gaps '
            'remained between the two sides, particularly on state aid and the '
            'role of the European court of justice. Whitehall sources suggest '
            'the earliest a decision on triggering article 16 could be made is '
            'the third week in November, after Cop26.\n'
            'Lord Frost and the European Commission vice-president Maroš '
            'Šefčovič are due to meet on Friday to assess progress in talks. '
            'Earlier this week it emerged that Frost’s drive to get the '
            'existing Northern Ireland protocol scrapped was as much rooted in '
            'opposition to the deal Theresa May struck in December 2017 as it '
            'was in delivering a new agreement to the unionist community that '
            'oppose the protocol. Writing in a foreword to a new paper for the '
            'Policy Exchange thinktank, Frost said the EU-UK joint report, '
            'which set the terms for the article 50 process of divorce from '
            'the EU, was a result of the UK failing to make “the necessary '
            'mental shift from being a member of the EU to negotiating exit '
            'from the EU”. Haigh urged negotiators not to stoke tension over '
            'the protocol, which has prompted a resurgence in identity '
            'politics in Northern Ireland, and to bring local leaders in from '
            'the sidelines. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, '
            'admitted in the House of Commons last week that democratically '
            'elected leaders in Northern Ireland had still not been privy to '
            'the UK’s legal text of the negotiating position. “It is simply '
            'unsustainable for leaders, businesses and civic society to be '
            'shut out on huge decisions being made about their future,” said '
            'Haigh. “Businesses and communities want a deal and with rising '
            'tension, the last thing Northern Ireland needs is more poisonous '
            'instability.” “If the government are really acting in Northern '
            'Ireland’s interests, rather than their own, then they should draw '
            'back the veil of secrecy, move the talks to Belfast, and give '
            'Northern Ireland a seat at the table,” she added.',

            'he’s sold the family home and is making plans for his own '

{'article': 'I don’t know if it is too late for humanity to avert a climate '
            'catastrophe, but I am sure there is no chance if we continue to '
            'treat global heating and the destruction of nature as separate '
            'problems.\n'
            'That is the wrongheaded approach of the United Nations, which is '
            'about to stage one big global conference for the climate in '
            'Glasgow, having just finished a different big global conference '
            'for biodiversity in Kunming. This division is as much of a '
            'mistake as the error made by universities when they teach '
            'chemistry in a different class from biology and physics. It is '
            'impossible to understand these subjects in isolation because they '
            'are interconnected. The same is true of living organisms that '
            'greatly influence the global environment. The composition of the '
            'Earth’s atmosphere and the temperature of the surface is actively '
            'maintained and regulated by the biosphere, by life, by what the '
            'ancient Greeks used to call Gaia. Almost 60 years ago, I '
            'suggested our planet self-regulated like a living organism. I '
            'called this the Gaia theory, and was later joined by biologist '
            'Lynn Margulis, who also espoused this idea. Both of us were '
            'roundly criticised by scientists in academia. I was an outsider, '
            'an independent scientist, and the mainstream view then was the '
            'neo-Darwinist one that life adapts to the environment, not that '
            'the relationship also works in the other direction, as we argued. '
            'In the years since, we have seen just how much life – especially '
            'human life – can affect the environment. Two genocidal acts – '
            'suffocation by greenhouse gases and the clearance of the '
            'rainforests – have caused changes on a scale not seen in millions '
            'of years. Because subjects like astronomy, geology, and '
            'meteorology are taught separately in schools and universities, '
            'few people are aware of the natural forces affecting the Earth’s '
            'surface temperature. For billions of years the Earth’s surface '
            'temperature has been determined mainly by the radiant heat coming '
            'from the sun. This energy increased over time because it is the '
            'nature of stars like the sun to increase their heat output as '
            'they grow older. But temperatures on Earth remained relatively '
            'stable thanks to Gaia: forests, oceans and other elements in the '
            'the Earth’s regulating system, which kept the surface temperature '
            'fairly constant and near optimal for life. The global warming '
            'that concerns all of us, and which will be discussed this week in '
            'Glasgow, includes a great deal of extra heating that comes as a '
            'consequence of extracting and burning fossil fuels since about '
            'the middle of the 19th century. That releases methane, carbon '
            'dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. They absorb radiant '
            'heat and stop it escaping from Earth. This is what causes global '
            'warming. The amount of global warming depends hugely on the '
            'properties of water. When cold ice forms, much of it is white '
            'snow. This reflects the sunlight back to space and is cooling. '
            'But when it is warm, the water vapour in the air is a powerful '
            'greenhouse gas that makes it warmer still. Much of the confusion '
            'over global heating comes about because of the huge quantities of '
            'heat needed to change the state of water. Few are aware that to '
            'melt a gram of ice takes 80 calories, enough heat to raise the '
            'temperature of 1ml of water to 80C. Try an ice cube in your '
            'boiling hot tea. Then imagine how much heat was needed to melt '
            'large areas of the polar ice cap during the recent summer and how '
            'much hotter the world would have been if the ice had not been '
            'there. No wonder there is confusion about whether there is global '
            'heating or not. Warnings that once seemed like the doom scenarios '
            'of science fiction are now coming to pass. We are entering into a '
            'heat age in which the temperature and sea levels will be rising '
            'decade by decade until the world becomes unrecognisable. We could '
            'also be in for more surprises. Nature is non-linear and '
            'unpredictable, never more than at a time of transition. Lowering '
            'these risks and adapting to those we can no longer avoid will '
            'require a mobilisation of resources on the scale of a war '
            'economy. We have no choice but to reduce the burning of fossil '
            'fuels or face even worse consequences. But we should also not '
            'become over-reliant on renewable power, which will leave us with '
            'an energy gap. We need to build more nuclear power stations to '
            'overcome that, though the greens will first have to get over '
            'their overblown fears of radiation. The dangers are nowhere near '
            'as bad as they are often painted. I’ve travelled millions of '
            'miles by air, and all that time I have been exposed to levels of '
            'radiation that are ten times as great as at ground level. The '
            'dangers are exaggerated. We also need to address the problem of '
            'overpopulation and to urgently halt the destruction of tropical '
            'forests. Most of all, we need to look at the world in a holistic '
            'way. I am not hopeful of a positive outcome at Cop26, knowing who '
            'is participating. I was not invited to Glasgow, though that is '
            'hardly a surprise. As well as being 102 years old, I am an '
            'independent scientist, and the university academics have never '
            'been comfortable with that. But my fellow humans must learn to '
            'live in partnership with the Earth, otherwise the rest of '
            'creation will, as part of Gaia, unconsciously move the Earth to a '
            'new state in which humans may no longer be welcome. The virus, '
            'Covid-19, may well have been one negative feedback. Gaia will try '
            'harder next time with something even nastier. James Lovelock is '
            'the originator of Gaia theory and the author, most recently, of '
            'Novascene. This op-ed was told to Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s '

            'home to the Black woman who has worked for them her whole life in '

            'believed: the novel is 2/1 at both Ladbrokes and William Hill to '
            'take the prize. Galgut, who has been shortlisted twice before for '
            'the Booker but has never won, has said he felt “relief, '
            'excitement and a fair amount of anxiety” at making the shortlist. '
            '“Damon Galgut has been all the rage with literary punters since '

            'Promise will land this year’s Booker,” said Ladbrokes’ Jessica '

            '5/1 and Patricia Lockwood’s internet-focused No One is Talking '
            'About This is at 6/1. Lockwood’s debut – the only first novel on '
            'the shortlist – is the bestselling title of the six, however, '
            'with 9,541 copies sold to date, according to the Bookseller, '
            'narrowly ahead of The Promise’s 8,844. Nadifa Mohamed, the sole '
            'British writer to make this year’s Booker shortlist, is at 8/1 at '
            'Ladbrokes for The Fortune Men, inspired by the real-life story of '
            'a Somali seaman wrongfully convicted of murder in Wales. Sri '

            'to what awaits beyond the tarmac after touchdown. Joe Root '

            'cricketer. Nevertheless he could be forgiven for finding himself '
            'somewhere between the two states of mind when he boards the '
            'flight to Australia on Thursday. If there is a twinge of despair '
            'in the departure lounge or a wave of panic amid the clouds it '
            'could be because the next few weeks might well define his legacy '
            'as a batter and as a captain. To the bat first. Root has enjoyed '
            'a remarkable run of form in 2021. In 12 Test matches, beginning '
            'with Sri Lanka in January and India home and away since, he has '
            'swept, stroked, glanced, cut, driven, defended and dominated '
            'against searing pace and devilish spin. On Asian dustbowl and '
            'English green-top, under Chennai sun and Pennine cloud. Root has '
            'been an almost constant figure at the crease, runs flowing from '
            'his blade with surgeon-like precision; 1,455 of them at an '
            'average a tick over 66. His six centuries this calendar year '
            'include three double centuries, a 186 and a 180 not out. With the '
            'rest of England’s top order quacking and creaking of late, Root’s '
            'runs have been increasingly imperative. If England are to get '
            'even the pinkiest of fingers around the urn during five Test '
            'matches in Australia on deathly-dull drop-in batter-friendly '
            'pitches, Root surely has to pick up where he left off and extend '
            'his purple patch up to Christmas and beyond. But here’s the rub. '
            'Root has never scored a century in Australia. In fact, as he '
            'cruises over the vast expanses on Friday, he will be unable to '
            'recall too many happy memories from his intended destination. Oz '
            'has been his bogey-land, he has an average of 38 in his nine '
            'Tests down under. While the lofty 30s might be a mere pipe dream '
            'for some of the top-order batters who have made the plane, that’s '
            'a significant drop-off for Root whose career average after 109 '
            'Tests is north of 50. He has made no secret of his desperation to '
            'put this record straight.\n'
            'Root has also pointed to the pain of being dropped for the 2014 '
            'Sydney Test after a quiet tour in which he occasionally looked '
            'cowed at the crease. To be fair, in that series the '
            'half-man-half-velociraptor Mitchell Johnson was ravaging his way '
            'through England’s batting lineup repeatedly, making even the most '
            'seasoned players yearn for the departure lounge. The memory of '
            'missing out in that game inspired Root to improve. “Cooky sat me '
            'down and said: ‘It’s a tough call but you are not going to play '
            'in this game.’” He opened up to fellow Sheffield Collegiate '
            'alumnus and England captain Michael Vaughan in 2015. “I can’t '
            'remember what I did for the next hour. I was gone. I was an empty '
            'vessel … but then I was absolutely spewing. I was so angry and '
            'gutted because I had not scored runs, not because I thought I '
            'deserved to play.”\n'
            'Four years later, Sydney again, but a different type of spewing. '
            'A debilitating bout of viral gastroenteritis struck Root down. '
            'Now captain and with England battling to stay in the game – the '
            'urn long since relinquished – Root spent time hooked up to a drip '
            'at St Vincent’s hospital up the road from the Sydney Cricket '
            'Ground. Although he briefly made it back to the ground and out '
            'into the middle, he was physically unable to continue. Forced to '
            'retire on 58 not out after nearly four hours of batting with a '
            'raging fever in temperatures topping 50 degrees. At the moment of '
            'defeat he was passed out on a bench in the dressing room. Jimmy '
            'Anderson had to stand in for his stricken captain to do the media '
            'postmortem. Despite this, when Root boards the plane to '
            'Queensland this week it might even be with a sigh of relief. At '
            'last, it is on. The prospect of Messrs Cummins, Hazelwood, Starc '
            'and Lyon – each in possession of their own fearful projectiles – '
            'lying in wait at the Gabba on 8 December – is far preferable to '
            'the uncertainty and speculation of the past few months.\n'
            'At one stage there were rumblings that those with young families '
            '– Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, potentially even Root himself – '
            'would in effect be left with little choice but to rule themselves '
            'out of the tour due to the stringent quarantine regulations in '
            'place. The prospect of a cad’s tour to Oz was briefly in the '
            'offing, a Sam Billings XI or suchlike. In the end, with the right '
            'assurances made and the pandemic in Australia headed finally in '
            'the right direction, not to mention millions of pounds worth of '
            'broadcasting money at stake, the 2021-22 Ashes were cleared for '
            'takeoff. Perhaps crucially, Root will also have Ben Stokes by his '

{'article': 'The international community’s chief representative in Bosnia has '
            'warned that the country is in imminent danger of breaking apart, '
            'and there is a “very real” prospect of a return to conflict. In a '
            'report to the UN seen by the Guardian, Christian Schmidt, the '
            'high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, said that if Serb '
            'separatists carry out their threat to recreate their own army, '
            'splitting the national armed forces in two, more international '
            'peacekeepers would have to be sent back in to stop the slide '
            'towards a new war. International peacekeeping duties in Bosnia '
            'are currently the task of a residual EU force (Eufor) that is 700 '
            'strong. Nato retains a formal toehold with a headquarters in '
            'Sarajevo. The year-long mandate for both is up for renewal this '
            'week at the UN security council, but Russia has threatened to '
            'block a resolution unless all references to the high '
            'representative are removed, potentially undermining Schmidt’s '
            'authority as the overseer of the 1995 Dayton peace deal. In his '
            'first report since taking up the post in August, Schmidt, a '
            'former German government minister, warned that Bosnia was facing '
            '“the greatest existential threat of the postwar period”. The '
            'Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, is threatening to pull out of '
            'state-level institutions, including the national army built up '
            'with international assistance over the past quarter century, and '
            'reconstitute a Serb force. On 14 October, Dodik said he would '
            'force the Bosnian army to withdraw from the Republika Srpska (the '
            'Serb half of Bosnia) by surrounding its barracks and that if the '
            'west tried to intervene militarily, he had “friends” who had '
            'promised to support the Serb cause, a presumed reference to '
            'Serbia and Russia. Bosnian Serb police carried out '
            '“counter-terrorist” exercises last month on Mount Jahorina, from '
            'where Serb forces bombarded Sarajevo throughout a 1992-95 siege. '
            '“This is tantamount to secession without proclaiming it,” Schmidt '
            'wrote in a report delivered to the UN secretary general, António '
            'Guterres, on Friday. He said Dodik’s actions “endanger not only '
            'the peace and stability of the country and the region, but – if '
            'unanswered by the international community – could lead to the '
            'undoing of the [Dayton peace] agreement itself.” The high '
            'representative said it was possible there would be clashes '
            'between Bosnian national law enforcement agencies and Bosnian '
            'Serb police. “Should the armed force of BiH [Bosnia and '
            'Herzegovina] splinter into two or more armies, the level of '
            'international military presence would require reassessment,” '
            'Schmidt warned. “A lack of response to the current situation '
            'would endanger the [Dayton agreement], while instability in BiH '
            'would have wider regional implications,” he said. “The prospects '
            'for further division and conflict are very real.” Schmidt’s '
            'warnings were delivered as the UN security council was preparing '
            'its annual resolution renewing the peacekeeping mandate for Eufor '
            'and the Nato headquarters, with a vote as early as Wednesday. '
            'Moscow is threatening to block the resolution unless all '
            'references to the high representative are removed. The Kremlin '
            'opposed Schmidt’s appointment by a Peace Implementation Council, '
            'an ad hoc multinational body set up to implement the Dayton peace '
            'agreement, and refuses to recognise his authority. “I suspect '
            'what Russia really wants is to chip away at the authority of the '
            'high representative’s office by stopping him briefing the '
            'council,” said a diplomat close to the discussions. Kurt '
            'Bassuener, co-founder and senior associate of the Democratization '
            'Policy Council, a Berlin-based thinktank, said: “It sounds like '
            'the Americans, the Brits and the French have effectively agreed '
            'to really strip back the references to the high representative '
            'that were boilerplate, standard issue language in all the '
            'previous resolutions.” He added: “And while legally that doesn’t '
            'undercut the high representative, politically it sure as hell '
            'does.” Even if Eufor’s mandate is renewed, there is little '
            'appetite in the EU to beef up the small force left in Bosnia. '
            'Some member states, particularly Hungary, are supportive of '
            'Dodik. “I think he’s willing to gamble on the possibility that, '
            'as improbable as it is, he can get away with it by essentially '
            'creating new facts on the ground rapidly and counting on the idea '
            'that confusion and delay would grip both Sarajevo and the '
            'international community and there would ultimately be no '
            'meaningful international consequences,” Jasmin Mujanović, a '
            'Bosnian political scientist, said. US deputy assistant secretary '
            'of state Gabriel Escobar told Congress last week that the US is '
            'working with the EU to “make sure there are consequences for any '
            'illegal or any destabilising actions” in Bosnia. But it is '
            'unclear whether the Biden administration would support a return '
            'to Nato peacekeeping. Alida Vračić, the head of a Bosnia-based '
            'thinktank, Populari, said the perpetual and worsening sense of '
            'crisis allows the country’s leaders to disguise their failure to '
            'govern. “Dodik has gone ballistic, but collectively politicians '
            'hope to win points on this crisis and citizens are the only '
            'losers as expected,” Vračić said. “This discussion comes in '
            'handy, as it derails all meaningful discussions like the fact '
            'that Sarajevo is choking in smog, that [the regional governments] '
            'embezzled money in the Covid-19 crisis, that the death toll in '
            'Sarajevo is worse than during the war, the fact that half of the '
            'country is living in poverty, that we have completed exactly zero '
            'reforms, that no laws have been discussed in the parliament for '
            'months.” • The headline on this article was amended on 2 November '

{'article': 'The construction of smart motorways should be paused until '
            'promised safety improvements have been delivered and there is '
            'more evidence to assess the risks, MPs have urged. The '
            'cross-party transport select committee criticised as premature '
            'the decision by Grant Shapps in March 2020 to press ahead with '
            'the use of the controversial motorways in the face of mounting '
            'concern about their safety. While the government has maintained '
            'that smart motorways are as safe as conventional ones, MPs said '
            'at least five years of trial data covering all variants of smart '
            'motorway, which manage road speeds through electronic signs and '
            'do not have a hard shoulder, were needed. The report said the '
            'available evidence was “limited and volatile”, and urged greater '
            'powers for the Office of Rail and Road to block new road schemes '
            'until it was satisfied of their safety.\n'
            'The scale of measures needed to mitigate the risks from removing '
            'the hard shoulder on motorways had been underestimated, MPs said, '
            'and Highways England (the old name for National Highways) and the '
            'Department for Transport had failed to deliver promised safety '
            'upgrades. More emergency refuge areas should be retrofitted to '
            'existing all-lane running smart motorways to be never more than '
            'one mile apart, and every 0.75 miles where possible. The highway '
            'code should also be updated with instructions to drivers to '
            'create corridors to allow emergency services to reach the scene '
            'of incidents, according to the MPs. The report did not go as far '
            'some campaigners in calling for smart motorways to be scrapped, '
            'after a number of motorists who had broken down in a live lane '
            'and been hit by other vehicles were killed. However, it said that '
            'Shapps’ so-called “stock take” and 18-point plan last year would '
            'not go far enough in addressing the risks. MPs also questioned '
            'Shapps’ decision to end by 2025 the use of “dynamic” all-lane '
            'running, where the hard shoulder is sometimes used as a live '
            'traffic lane. They suggested that with clear, consistent use such '
            'motorways would be preferable, as they could retain the hard '
            'shoulder in quieter times. The committee chair, Huw Merriman, '
            'said as only 29 miles of all-lane running smart motorways had '
            'operated for over five years, it “feels too soon, and uncertain, '
            'to use this as an evidence base to remove the hard shoulder from '
            'swathes of our motorway network”. He said the focus on upgrading '
            'safety by ministers was welcome, “but we’ve been here before. '
            'We’re not convinced that reinstating the hard shoulder on '
            'existing schemes is the answer, but the DfT must pause the '
            'rollout and take stock.” The select committee in June 2016 called '
            'on the government to drop or pause the rollout of smart '
            'motorways, which have been seen as a comparatively cheap and easy '
            'way to increase capacity on the UK’s major road networks. A '
            'report then concluded that the trade-off in safety was an '
            '“unacceptable price to pay” for all-lane running. Motoring '
            'organisations welcomed the latest report, which they said was '
            'pragmatic and endorsed their calls for measures to improve '
            'safety. Labour said it confirmed that ministers had wrongly '
            'pressed ahead in the face of overwhelming warning evidence. Jim '
            'McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said: “We know smart '
            'motorways in their current form, coupled with inadequate safety '
            'systems, are not fit for purpose and are putting lives at risk. '
            'Reinstating the hard shoulder while full investigations are '
            'carried out need not be costly … the government must finally '
            'listen.” A DfT spokesperson said: “We’re pleased that the '
            'committee recognises that reinstating the hard shoulder on all '
            'all-lane running motorways could put more drivers and passengers '
            'at risk of death and serious injury and that we’re right to focus '
            'on upgrading their safety, as the secretary of state committed to '
            'doing when he became transport secretary.” While “improvements '
            'have not always been made as quickly as they could have been in '
            'the past”, Shapps had committed £500m on upgrades and the faster '
            'rollout of stopped vehicle detection technology, they added.',

            'algorithm-driven Facebook ecosystem, said the US senator Sheldon '
            'Whitehouse. “Facebook and other social media companies make money '
            'when they send users down rabbit holes of climate denial,” he '
            'said. “That’s a very dangerous business model for the future of '
            'the planet.” In 2020, Facebook launched a Climate Change Science '
            'Center, which contains factual data from credible sources on the '
            'climate crisis to counteract the spread of misinformation on its '
            'platforms. It also adds informational labels to some posts about '
            'the climate crisis, which direct users to the center. A spokesman '
            'for Facebook said it received more than 100,000 visitors each '
            'day. That resource was previously targeted primarily at US users, '
            'but on Monday, the company announced it was expanding its Climate '
            'Change Science Center to more than 100 countries, labeling posts '
            'for the first time in Belgium, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, '
            'the Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan. But the study’s authors are '
            'asking the social media platform to go much further. They called '
            'on Facebook to stop taking payment from the publications to '
            'promote their content and to label misinformation about the '
            'climate crisis on a larger number of posts. The study found that '
            '92% of the most popular articles examined did not have a label '
            'about climate crisis misinformation. CCDH also called on Google '
            'to remove eight of the 10 publications using Google Ads to profit '
            'from their climate crisis denial content. The researchers '
            'determined those eight publications earned an estimated $3.6m '
            'through Google Ads in the last six months. Imran Ahmed, chief '
            'executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, argued that '
            'the “bad faith misinformation” pushed by the 10 websites is '
            'designed to undermine social media users’ confidence in science. '
            'By not acting more forcefully, Ahmed said, “big tech is once '
            'again on the wrong side of science, truth and human progress.” '
            'The deputy editor in chief of RT, which according to the CCDH '
            'study published articles on “climate alarmism” condemning '
            '“doom-mongers” who believed climate change was worsening and has '
            'been called “one of the most important organizations in the '
            'global political economy of disinformation”, told the Guardian '
            'that the publication “constantly raises concerns over '
            'environmental issues”. RT would not “disregard the variety of '
            'views essential to a healthy public discourse on its effects”, '
            'Anna Belkina said. Other websites named in the study did not '

            'cope as hundreds of thousands of pounds promised to them by the '
            'government has not yet materialised. The Home Office has pledged '
            'to provide councils with £28 a person a day to provide essential '
            'support to Afghan families in hotels. But a government source '
            'told the Guardian: “Local authorities will be offered £28 per '
            'person per day to provide support to the guests. This will be '
            'backdated and we will be working with local authorities on how it '
            'can be claimed in due course.” Georgia Gould, the chair of London '
            'Councils, said: “London boroughs have stepped up to provide '
            'emergency support for hundreds of Afghan families evacuated '
            'during the summer. Despite promises from the Home Office, '
            'councils are yet to receive any funding to cover the cost of '
            'clothing, medical supplies or the hiring of support staff to help '
            'evacuees with basic needs. “We are urgently seeking reassurance '
            'from government that boroughs will receive this funding and that '
            'it will be extended to British nationals who have so far been '
            'excluded from this offer, which is unacceptable.”\n'
            'The news comes after reports that the Home Office’s debit cards, '
            'known as Aspen cards, failed to activate, leaving new arrivals '
            'from Afghanistan with no cash. The Refugee Council said it was '
            'making payments of £7-8,000 a week in emergency cash to refugees. '
            'Many people airlifted to safety from Afghanistan this summer are '
            'still unclear about their immigration status and not everyone has '
            'been told for which resettlement scheme they qualify and whether '
            'they are eligible for family reunion. London Councils told the '
            'Guardian it had received 221 homelessness applications from '
            'Afghans who do not qualify for resettlement support when they '
            'leave the hotel accommodation they were placed in when they '
            'arrived. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee '
            'Council, said: “It’s alarming that families with large numbers of '
            'vulnerable children, many of whom are very traumatised, are '
            'having to live in hotels without the support they need and '
            'without any money of their own. “It’s critical that every family '
            'is given the warm welcome the government has promised so that it '
            'becomes a reality rather than just an aspiration. Government '
            'needs to step up its efforts by creating across Whitehall '
            'taskforce to make this happen.” A government spokesperson said: '
            '“The emergency evacuation of Afghanistan was the biggest and '
            'fastest in our country’s recent history. It helped over 15,000 '
            'people, including those who served alongside our armed forces, to '
            'safety in the United Kingdom. The government is working at pace '

{'article': 'Tony, a gender-fluid social worker, knows they have two battles '
            'to face if they want to change public attitudes towards HIV and '
            'the transgender community in their home country of Georgia. An '
            'acutely marginalised group, it was only in March this year that '
            'the first trans person in the country had their gender status '
            'legally recognised by the courts. Tony identifies prejudice and '
            'stigma as constant barriers for trans people trying to access '
            'healthcare. “Transphobia can jeopardise people’s sexual health, '
            'or may lead to poor treatment adherence if they already have '
            'HIV,” says Tony, who is also executive director of the trans '
            'advocacy group Temida in Tbilisi. “They may be less likely to get '
            'tested and to receive medication.” Raising awareness of these '
            'issues is crucial to reducing stigma and improving the health and '
            'wellbeing of trans people and other communities most affected by '
            'HIV. Tony is one of a diverse group of HIV community leaders from '
            'across eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA) who are telling '
            'their stories as part of Radian Changemakers, an effort to raise '
            'awareness of HIV in the region and the devastating effects of '
            'stigma around the virus. Both AIDS-related deaths and new HIV '
            'infections have continued to rise in EECA despite numbers falling '
            'in other global regions. According to the Joint United Nations '
            'Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), EECA is “failing to control its '
            'HIV epidemic”. The annual number of new HIV infections increased '
            'by 43% between 2010 and 2020, making EECA “the fastest growing '
            'HIV epidemic in the world” and one of two regions in the world '
            'where new HIV infections rose in that period. In the Middle East '
            'and north Africa, new infections increased by 7%.\n'
            'Radian is a groundbreaking partnership between the Elton John '
            'AIDS Foundation and pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which '
            'aims to help reduce HIV infections and to end HIV as a public '
            'health threat by 2030 in EECA. According to UNAIDS, deaths from '
            'AIDS-related illnesses have risen by 32% in the past 10 years and '
            'now account for nearly 100 deaths a day in EECA. More than 380 '
            'people are newly diagnosed with HIV every day, adding to the 1.6 '
            'million people already estimated to be living with the virus in '
            'the region. The Radian partnership has two arms. The Unmet Need '
            'fund supports individual grassroots organisations devoted to HIV '
            'prevention and care, while its Model Cities programme provides '
            'significant funding to improve access to lifesaving HIV services '
            'in key EECA cities and regions to reduce new HIV infections and '
            'AIDS-related deaths, as examples for other cities and regions in '
            'EECA seeking to end their own HIV epidemic. Almaty in Kazakhstan '
            'is Radian’s first model city.\n'
            'Community Friends is the primary organisation addressing HIV '
            'among Almaty’s LGBTQ+ community, and one of the first '
            'organisations to receive support from Radian. Founded by '
            'Svyatoslav Suslov, it works directly with the city’s trans '
            'community and men who have sex with men (MSM). “It’s sad to see '
            'that while on average the whole world is recording a downward '
            'curve in new [HIV] cases, here we have an increase in '
            'infections,” says Suslov. However, the work of Community Friends '
            'is already having an impact. It provides practical support '
            'including HIV tests, access to prevention programmes and peer '
            'support groups for MSM and trans people. But crucially it is also '
            'helping to reduce the stigma associated with HIV. Suslov says: '
            '“There are more people who have begun to talk openly about the '
            'fact that they have been living with HIV for many years.” In '
            'another part of the city, Lyubov, who was diagnosed with HIV 17 '
            'years ago, advocates for the rights of people living with HIV. '
            'Her organisation, supported by Radian, runs HIV awareness '
            'training for healthcare staff to help reduce the stigma and '
            'discrimination associated with a positive diagnosis. Lyubov says '
            'her work has taught her to be more compassionate towards those '
            'who discriminate against people with HIV. “You can’t just force '
            'change on people,” she says. “We need to understand the people '
            'discriminating are human beings, and that they need help to '
            'understand that HIV is not scary. This experience stays in my '
            'memory as it changed how I work.”\n'
            'Approximately 1,500 miles away in Yekaterinburg in Russia, Vera '
            'knows first-hand what it really means to live with HIV. Diagnosed '
            '20 years ago, she knew she had to take action when she realised '
            'that increasing numbers of her friends and family were dying from '
            'the virus. “I felt I had no choice,” she says. “I realised that I '
            'was already deeply affected by the disaster, so I had to do '
            'something about it.” Vera’s organisation has recently celebrated '
            'its 10-year anniversary as a registered charity, after starting '
            'as a local peer support group and patient information centre for '
            'people living with or at risk of HIV – including sex workers, '
            'prisoners and people who use drugs.\n'
            'Today, with help from Radian, the organisation is helping to save '
            'lives and providing support for grassroots organisations. Working '
            'in harmony with the government-backed local AIDS centre, it is '
            'connecting people who are receiving HIV treatment to lifesaving '
            'care. By providing individual and group counselling, organising '
            'outreach events and HIV prevention exhibitions, the organisation '
            'is leading efforts to address HIV and AIDS across the Sverdlovsk '
            'region. Radian hopes that by amplifying the voices of community '
            'leaders it can draw greater attention to the continuing HIV '
            'epidemic in the EECA region. Anne Aslett, chief executive officer '
            'of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, says: “Local innovations are '
            'key to tackling the unique issues of the AIDS epidemic in eastern '
            'Europe and central Asia. We are excited to shine a light on the '
            'remarkable work of local experts supported through our Radian '
            'partnership and the vital role they play in the HIV response.” '
            'Alex Kalomparis, vice-president of international public affairs '
            'at Gilead Sciences, echoes her praise, heralding the changemakers '
            'as “the people who are leaders in ending this epidemic”. If you '

{'article': 'For many people, an HIV diagnosis is frightening and isolating, '
            'leaving them to wonder what their future holds. For Vera, who '
            'discovered she had HIV in 2001 at the age of 23, the diagnosis '
            'was a catalyst to act, changing the trajectory of her life for '
            'ever. “All my activities probably stem, in one way or another, '
            'from the fact that I am living with HIV. Now I am surrounded by '
            'people who are active in this sphere,” she says. Vera leads an '
            'organisation that provides community-based services for people '
            'affected by HIV. Radian, a joint initiative of the Elton John '
            'AIDS Foundation and pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, '
            'supports organisations such as Vera’s to address the burgeoning '
            'HIV/AIDS epidemic in eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA). '
            'Contrary to global trends, deaths from AIDS-related illnesses '
            'have increased by around 32% in the past 10 years in EECA, and an '
            'estimated 1.6 million people are living with HIV in the region.\n'
            'Part of the problem is that there is still significant stigma '
            'attached to living with HIV, which discourages people from '
            'accessing necessary treatment and care, leading to poorer health '
            'and increased HIV transmission. A report by the Joint United '
            'Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) shows that an estimated '
            '53% of people living with HIV in EECA are receiving treatment '
            'compared with 73% globally. To help address this issue, Radian '
            'will support targeted interventions in up to 25 countries in EECA '
            'over the next five years, working with a number of grassroots '
            'organisations. Vera’s is one of them. After she saw the need for '
            'support services for people like herself, Vera began running '
            'groups and patient information meetings to help people living '
            'with HIV in 2010. Support from Radian is helping Vera and her '
            'organisation to contribute to Russia’s national strategy goal to '
            'connect people living with HIV to lifesaving care and treatment '
            'and to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030. Vera is working '
            'with her local AIDS centre to implement mobile search teams to '
            'bring people living with HIV back into care so they can receive '
            'treatment. Despite living in an area with a high prevalence of '
            'HIV, Vera is optimistic that they can bring about change. “Every '
            'life matters,” she says. Access to treatment and care is critical '
            'in reducing new cases of HIV and ending AIDS. When people living '
            'with HIV are on treatment, not only are their health outcomes '
            'improved, but it’s impossible to transmit the virus. Radian hopes '
            'to help tackle the issue through its Model Cities programme and '
            'the Unmet Need fund, which aim to expand access to lifesaving '
            'services and help end the HIV epidemic in key EECA cities. '
            'Globally, young women aged 15 to 24 are twice as likely to be '
            'living with HIV than young men, according to UNAIDS. In EECA, '
            'women account for a rising proportion of people living with HIV.\n'
            'Lyubov, a 36-year-old mother from Kazakhstan, has lived with HIV '
            'for 17 years. She has directly experienced how HIV impacts '
            'women’s health, safety and wellbeing. Lyubov started campaigning '
            'after trying to help a domestic abuse victim who was turned away '
            'from her local crisis centre when staff discovered she had HIV. '
            '“I called the head of the crisis centre and told her if they '
            'didn’t accept this woman, we would be filing a lawsuit against '
            'them for discrimination, and then of course they said: ‘OK’,” she '
            'says. The following day, Lyubov went back to the crisis centre to '
            'deliver HIV training to help staff understand more about HIV '
            'transmission, stigma and discrimination. HIV can cause specific '
            'health problems for women including issues with their menstrual '
            'cycle, early menopause and a higher risk of cervical cancer. '
            'Pregnant women, who are not on treatment, are more likely to pass '
            'on HIV to their unborn baby and women are also more likely to '
            'develop heart problems if they have HIV. Women are already more '
            'likely to experience social and economic inequality than men, and '
            'more than half (52%) of women from EECA have experienced physical '
            'abuse after being diagnosed with HIV, a 2019 study by the '
            'Eurasian Women’s Network on AIDS (EWNA) shows. Lyubov hopes her '
            'organisation, which provides information and anti-discrimination '
            'training to staff in healthcare institutions and shelter homes '
            'for homeless women, will continue to help overcome the stigma '
            'that still surrounds HIV. “Unfortunately, I am one of the few '
            'people who feels able to talk openly about my HIV status, but I '
            'think this can be extremely impactful when we are conducting '
            'training with doctors, police, and the community. It’s important '
            'to be visible,” she says. “Vera and Lyubov are inspirational. '
            'They’ve turned their direct experience as women living with HIV '
            'into action,” says Anne Aslett, chief executive officer of the '
            'Elton John AIDS Foundation. “It can be difficult to disclose your '
            'status, seek support or know where to turn, and these two '
            'champions are making HIV care more accessible and familiar to key '

{'article': 'Sudan has been hit by a severe cash shortage as most banks and '
            'cash machines remain closed one week after a military coup '
            'prompted a nationwide strike by bankers. About 90% of bankers '
            'were taking part in a civil disobedience campaign, said Ibrahim '
            'Abdel-Raheem, who works at the Workers National Bank in Sudan’s '
            'capital, Khartoum. “We knew that going on strike as bankers would '
            'cripple the economy,” he said. “Banks are the backbone of the '
            'economy.” The Sudanese Bankers Association has said it will stage '
            'protests in front of banks across the country on Tuesday and '
            'Thursday in a “revolutionary escalation” of its campaign. '
            'Abdel-Raheem said the action has affected him personally. “I had '
            'to give up many things,” he said. “I don’t even have one pound in '
            'my pocket. I am only buying the very basic things, because I have '
            'no cash.” Yassir Binawai, a 46-year-old who works in the mining '
            'industry in northern Sudan, said that he had to borrow money from '
            'his employer’s canteen to buy food. “It’s been so difficult to '
            'manage with the cash shortage,” he said. “But we will not give up '
            'despite all the struggles.” Cash still dominates the Sudanese '
            'economy due to a lack of ATM infrastructure. Western Union '
            'suspended its operations last week, making access to money '
            'harder. Salah Mamoun, from Omdurman, said he relied on friends '
            'who worked in the money exchange industry to get hold of cash. '
            '“There’s no money in the market,” he said. Commodity prices have '
            'fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, making financial planning hard '
            'for ordinary people. A shop owner in Khartoum who declined to '
            'give his name said he had been forced to borrow money from a '
            'neighbour and that his family was struggling. “There’s a '
            'recession, nobody buys things from our shop” he said. “My wife '
            'has money in her bank account [but] withdrawing it is an issue '
            'because the ATMs are empty.” On 25 October, Sudan’s top general, '
            'Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the cabinet as well as the '
            'ruling joint military-civilian Sovereign Council, which had been '
            'heading Sudan’s transition towards full civilian rule after the '
            '2019 overthrow of the autocratic president Omar al-Bashir. In a '
            'move widely condemned internationally, Burhan declared a state of '
            'emergency and detained Sudan’s civilian leadership, including the '
            'prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, and members of his government. '
            'The US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, '
            'arrived in Khartoum on Tuesday to try to defuse the crisis. '
            'Feltman accused Burhan of acting in bad faith by staging the coup '
            'hours after holding face-to-face discussions with him in '
            'Khartoum, in which he gave no hint of his plan to seize power. '
            'The US has paused $700m in debt relief and aid and urged '
            'potential allies of the Sudanese military – Russia and the United '
            'Arab Emirates – not to back the coup. “We are in with a number of '
            'nations, including the UAE, to restore the civilian [government] '
            'in Sudan,” Feltman said. Feltman urged the military to restore '
            'the ousted civilian government, release all prisoners including '
            'Hamdok, who is currently under house arrest, as well as to allow '
            'medical assistance to reach injured demonstrators without '
            'interference. “To the freedom-loving Sudanese and to those who '
            'would seek to rob them of their democratic ambitions, I say: ‘The '
            'world is watching and the Sudanese people have made it clear they '
            'will not accept a military attempt to sideline their hard fought '
            'democratic transition.’” Feltman also questioned Burhan’s bona '
            'fides. “For all his statements supporting the constitutional '
            'declaration of 2019 and their desire for elections, his actions '
            'have done the opposite, undermined the civilian military '
            'partnership and hijacked the type of transition that the military '
            'and civilians had agreed,” he said. Agence France-Presse '

{'article': 'Researching outfits for the Netflix western The Harder They Fall, '
            'the costume designer Antoinette Messam got a history lesson in '
            'the process. The film’s story is fictional, but it draws on the '
            'real-life black cowboys of the west, including Nat Love, Bill '
            'Pickett, Rufus Buck and characters such as Stagecoach Mary, who '
            'delivered mail across the US, protecting it from bandits with a '
            'shotgun. It is now thought that one in four cowboys were black, '
            'but this reality has been whitewashed from history. “I literally '
            'had to buy this book, The Black West,” says Messam. It contained '
            'images of these people for her to pore over. “They all had their '
            'own individual style,” she says. “So, when it came to my cast, it '
            'was really, really important that I differentiate everyone so '
            'they’re not a cookie-cutter, stereotypical cowboy, you know?”\n'
            'Directed by Jeymes Samuel and produced by Jay-Z, the film '
            'features Regina King, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Lakeith Stanfield, '
            'Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors. Their costumes showcase '
            'Messam’s research skills. Love, played by Majors, wears jeans. '
            'Messam says the original appeal was the indigo colour, “but I '
            'when I started doing my research, I was shocked to know that '
            'denim as I show it existed far before my timeline, from the '
            '1850s. I was like: ‘My shit is accurate, you guys.’” Stagecoach '
            'Mary, played by Beetz, is reimagined as a former gang member who '
            'owns saloons. She wears a corseted dress that multitasks. “When '
            'we first see her, it’s important to show her in the attire of a '
            'saloon,” says Messam. “Then, when we see her again, she’s dressed '
            'to go out on the plains … her dress is split, so that she can '
            'straddle a horse, not sit side-saddle, which was common at the '
            'time.”\n'
            'Details like this are crucial for Messam. Most viewers will '
            'notice King’s frilled blouse, Stanfield’s neckerchief or Elba’s '
            'red velvet jacket, but look closer and you will see the different '
            'cultural influences that people such as Love and Buck would have '
            'absorbed. “It was important for me to use references from all '
            'over the world,” says Messam. “Spanish references, Mexican '
            'references, indigenous references. Mary wears a lot of silver and '
            'turquoise, and they were influenced by the vaqueros, Mexican '
            'cowboys.” Cuffee, played by Danielle Deadwyler, is a '
            'gender-non-conforming character who provides the muscle on the '
            'door of Stagecoach Mary’s saloon. “In doing my research and '
            'coming across a woman who dressed non-binary, as we would call it '
            'now, it looked to me like it was mostly for practical reasons,” '
            'says Messam. Cuffee is clearly more comfortable in a man’s suit '
            'than a skirt. “To be taken seriously, that’s what worked for '
            'her,” says Messam. “If she was going to knock somebody out, it '
            'was better that she was wearing pants and a jacket.” While modern '
            'viewers might assume that the clothing in The Harder They Fall '
            'would conform to gender norms, Messam says the era was more '
            'varied in reality – especially in the wild west. This is evident '
            'in her costumes. “It’s hard to see some of them in the saloon, '
            'but there was a woman in hats and pants alongside the ladies of '
            'the night,” she says.\n'
            'The Harder They Fall comes out at a time when western style is '
            'enjoying a moment, with black Americans in the public eye '
            'showcasing the look. At the film’s premiere, Taraji P Henson wore '
            'a stetson, while others donned cowboy boots. This follows Beyoncé '
            'in chaps, Lil Nas X in a cowboy hat and the Yee-Haw Agenda, a '
            'website and Instagram account that works as an archive of '
            'imagery. Is this about rediscovering style heritage lost to '
            'history? “Well, there’s that – and there’s also the fact that '
            'people are becoming aware of the cowboy culture that exists now,” '
            'Messam says. She references Elba’s film, Concrete Cowboy, which '
            'is based on a real-life black cowboy community in Philadelphia, '
            'and a community she visited in California. “Doing this film, they '
            'brought in cowboys from across the country to ride the horses,” '
            'she says. “I got to know some of them. They’re so cool.” The '
            'Harder They Fall is on Netflix from 3 November',

            'emerged that BlackRock was halving its stake in the online '
            'retailer after a rocky month for the company. BlackRock, its '
            'largest institutional shareholder, is selling 58m shares priced '
            'at 195p each, or a 10.3% discount to the stock’s Monday close, '
            'according to bookrunner Goldman Sachs. The deal is valued at '
            '£113.1m. The world’s biggest fund manager had a 10.1% stake, or '
            'nearly 124m shares, in mid-October according to Refinitiv data. '
            'Shares in the Manchester-based THG, which runs websites including '
            'Lookfantastic and Cult Beauty, fell 9% to a record low of 197p on '
            'Tuesday, far below the flotation price of 500p in September '
            '2020.\n'
            'The shares soared to nearly 800p at the start of the year but '
            'have slumped in recent months because of concerns about the '
            'firm’s governance and the future of the business, after it '
            'flagged last week that profit margins would be squeezed by '
            'currency changes. Analysts have also pointed to a slowdown in '
            'growth at its core beauty division. “For a while THG was a stock '
            'market darling with investors clambering to own the stock in the '
            'belief it would play a key role in helping product manufacturers '
            'sell direct to consumers. Now it is losing fans at an incredibly '
            'rapid rate,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at the '
            'stockbroker AJ Bell. “Asset managers rarely sell after a stock '
            'has already fallen so much unless they’ve lost all confidence in '
            'the business and/or found something that completely changes the '
            'investment case. The backlash against THG seems to centre on the '
            'fact that people bought into the hype without paying attention to '
            'valuation. “Now that difficult questions are being asked about '
            'costs and more, particularly if the business is broken up into '
            'three as per the suggestion from THG, investors aren’t getting '
            'the answers they want – or they are not liking what they see.”\n'

            'Senate majority in tune on a trillion-dollar-plus budget '
            'reconciliation package without a single vote to spare? Just wait. '
            'These days of 50 Democratic senators may soon look like glory '
            'days.\n'
            'Democrats are staring down an ugly reality in the US Senate: the '
            'historical malapportionment of the upper chamber, which awards '
            'two members to every state, even though Wyoming’s population is '
            'not only 68 times smaller than California’s but smaller than 115 '
            'counties nationwide, already places the party at a disadvantage. '
            'This edge has only become more prominent due to polarization and '
            'population patterns, and will collide next with a challenging map '
            'in 2022 and an even harder one in 2024. It’s a problem so '
            'intractable that it makes even partisan gerrymandering seem like '
            'child’s play. Demographic change won’t help, either. Democrats '
            'are simply packed into fewer states. According to a 2020 Data for '
            'Progress study, that hands Republicans a three-percentage-point '
            'advantage. The nation has grown more multiracial and less white, '
            'according to 2020 census data, a trend which should, on balance, '
            'favor Democrats. But while the “emerging Democratic majority” is '
            'happening on paper, it has been structurally blocked from '
            'achieving political power. The white, non-college-educated voters '
            'that make up the largest part of the Republican coalition are '
            'shrinking in numbers nationwide, but they’re better distributed; '
            'those rural and less-educated voters still hold a dominant '
            'position in enough small states to claim a decisive grip over the '
            'Senate. Maybe 130,000 New York hipsters can be persuaded to move '
            'from Jackson Heights, Queens, to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It might '
            'be the best investment any liberal billionaire could make, since '
            'this is a political problem for Democrats but also a crisis for '
            'democracy without any easy solutions. The political analyst and '
            'pollster David Shor suggests that even if Democrats deliver “a '
            'startling performance” in 2022, defeat Republicans by four '
            'percentage points and surmount the losses that a governing party '
            'historically faces in the midterms, “they have about a 50-50 '
            'chance of holding the majority”. Win a more slender majority, '
            'says Shor – say 51% – and “they’ll likely lose a seat – and the '
            'Senate”. This isn’t a new development, of course: the structure '
            'of the Senate has been inegalitarian since our founding, and the '
            'nation’s political geography has provided the Republican party '
            'with a baked-in edge for decades. But contemporary partisan '
            'trends have exacerbated it. The Republican party held the US '
            'Senate between 1994 and 2006, and again from 2014 through 2020. '
            'However, according to research by Stephen Wolf of Daily Kos, '
            'Republican senators actually represented a majority of Americans '
            'during just one electoral cycle over those decades, in 1996-97. '
            '(Right now, the 50 Democratic senators represent 41 million more '
            'Americans than the 50 Republicans.) Wolf added up every vote cast '
            'for Democratic and Republican Senate candidates over this period, '
            'and calculated the total over every six-year period in order to '
            'determine which party had more support over the period of any '
            'given Senate term. Only during a small window over those three '
            'decades – covering Senate elections from 1994 through 1998 – did '
            'Republicans ever capture that three-cycle aggregate vote '
            'representing every ballot cast for all 100 senators. The '
            'trendline for Democrats does not look to be improving. The 2020 '
            'census showed that more than half of the 330 million Americans '
            'live in just nine states. That means upwards of 50% of us have 18 '
            'US senators, while the smaller half has the other 82. (By 2040, '
            'according to a University of Virginia forecast, half of the '
            'nation could live in only eight states, with just 16 senators.) '
            'Let’s break that down even further. Two-thirds of all Americans – '
            'some 219,073,534 of us, to be exact – live in the largest 15 '
            'states, according to census data. They’re represented by 30 '
            'senators – 22 Democrats and eight Republicans. The other third? '
            'They have 70 senators. These smaller states aren’t only whiter '
            'than the nation at large, they tilt decisively to the Republican '
            'party, represented by 42 Republicans and 28 Democrats. That’s '
            'more than enough to filibuster any legislation that cannot be '
            'passed through the reconciliation process – including voting '
            'rights – effectively granting veto power over even popular '
            'proposals to a tiny minority of voters from the smallest and '
            'whitest states. (As the Maine senator Angus King noted on the '
            'Senate floor last week, 41 senators representing just 24% of '
            'Americans can block legislation with the filibuster.) The '
            'Democrats’ future looks even bleaker when you graft that '
            'geographic reality on to a deeply polarized nation with more '
            'red-leaning states than blue, and voters increasingly less likely '
            'to split their ballots between a presidential candidate of one '
            'party and a US Senate hopeful from another. The Senate has become '
            'as sorted as the rest of the nation. Should the Senate represent '
            'states, or the American people? Should one-third of the nation '
            'retain the power to block legislation favored by large '
            'majorities? What does it mean to hold the consent of the governed '
            'when Democratic candidates for the US Senate – but also the US '
            'House and the White House – must win by large majorities to have '
            'a chance at holding more seats or electors, but Republicans can '
            'capture both chambers with fewer votes? In a moment in which we '
            'are focused on racial equity, how can we hand bonus '
            'representation to smaller, whiter states, ensuring that the '
            'Senate leans toward the interest of white voters on any issue '
            'where whites and communities of color diverge? And what does it '
            'hold for the legitimacy of the supreme court when five of nine '
            'conservatives have been selected by presidents that lost the '
            'popular vote, then confirmed by senators that represent a '
            'minority of Americans? There is no equality in a system so wildly '
            'malapportioned. A Congress designed 240 years ago to guard '
            'against a tyranny of the majority now ensures that a white '
            'majority in a changing nation maintains veto power simply by '
            'virtue of the smaller states where they live. Perhaps that has '
            'been the point of the Senate from the beginning. More than 25 '
            'years ago, in 1995, the former senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan '
            'observed that “sometime in the next century, the United States is '
            'going to have to address the question of apportionment in the '
            'Senate.” We’ve arrived at that moment. Now what? One solution '
            'would require Republicans conceding their advantage in the '
            'interest of representational fairness and broadening their appeal '
            'to voters in a multiracial nation. The other requires Democrats '
            'to broaden their appeal and win elections in states turning '
            'decisively the other direction, then using that power to add '
            'states or make otherwise bold reform. At this moment, as '
            'Republicans cement an enduring minority rule through '
            'gerrymandering, geography and the courts, and Democrats appear '
            'unable or unwilling to muster any meaningful response, both '
            'options feel equally unlikely. David Daley is the author of '

            'that there are powerful people coming for me, with detailed and '
            'strategic plans to control my body. Sounds dramatic, doesn’t it? '
            'It is dramatic, more so because it’s a straight-up fact. In 2021, '
            'state legislatures enacted more abortion restrictions than in any '
            'previous year, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher '
            'Institute, a research and policy body dedicated to advancing '
            'reproductive rights. Last month’s decision by the supreme court '
            'to refuse to block a Texas law all but banning abortion signals '
            'that the court could well be on the way to overturn Roe v Wade, '
            'and soon. National legalized abortion is just one part of this. '
            'Reproductive justice advocates as far back as 1994 understood '
            'that when women don’t have access to abortion it generally means '
            'that we don’t have access to a whole host of other rights: '
            'affordable contraceptives, comprehensive sex education, pre-natal '
            'care, even screening and treatment for a variety of diseases '
            'including cancer and HIV. This is an overall form of oppression, '
            'and I know what’s happening. I also fear I know what’s coming. I '
            'live in New York City, I am financially stable and I am white. '
            'These factors, as well as legal protections in New York, mean '
            'that I get to live a life free from coercion, with access to '
            'contraception, to reproductive healthcare, to a medical abortion '
            'if I need one. I don’t take this for granted, because this '
            'reality is worlds away from where I grew up – in Ireland, a '
            'country that only legalised abortion in 2018. Here in the US, '
            'back in 1973, the supreme court affirmed the legality of a '
            'woman’s right to have an abortion under the 14th amendment to the '
            'constitution. Living in this far from perfect nation, I still '
            'have the right to make choices about my own health and future, '
            'meaning a life with more dignity and autonomy than I had growing '
            'up, and that is an extraordinary thing. But even if I don’t yet '
            'feel it, the threat of losing this hard-won freedom is all around '
            'me. In the words of Alexis McGill Johnson, president and chief '
            'executive of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, “The '
            'moment is dark … No matter where you live, no matter where you '
            'are, this fight is at your doorstep right now.” McGill Johnson '
            'was speaking on 2 October, as women across the country organized '
            'through the Women’s March protested against the US supreme '
            'court’s refusal to block the Texas legislation. Talk about being '
            'up against it: Donald Trump appointed three conservative '
            'justices, meaning that the court now has an anti-abortion '
            'majority and reproductive justice hangs in the balance. That is '
            'why on 4 October, Emma Whittman, a 22-year-old public health '
            'student from Arizona sat in the road, blocking traffic outside '
            'the supreme court in Washington DC. She was arrested for civil '
            'disobedience.\n'
            '“I’m not from Texas, but I feel like I’m fighting for people in '
            'Texas,” she told me, as well as people “in all of these other '
            'states that will probably get abortion bans, and will be impacted '
            'when Roe v Wade is overturned. I feel like I’m fighting for all '
            'women around the country.” It was Whittman’s first arrest and the '
            'experience of being searched and held by the police was scary. '
            'Concerns about how an arrest and a potential criminal record may '
            'affect her future career worried her too. But Whittman was not '
            'alone. Her mother, an OB/GYN from Tucson, was there too, '
            'reassuring her daughter as she was zip-tied, telling her that she '
            'loved her and was proud of her. Women take care of each other. We '
            'always have. In Ireland, in the darkest and most oppressive '
            'times, when our reproductive rights and our health were out of '
            'our hands, we did what we could to make each other safe. In 1980 '
            'Irish women could not get condoms, divorce was illegal and '
            'abortion was shameful, illegal and dangerous. In 2018, after a '
            'compassionate but fierce campaign, almost two of every three '
            'Irish people voted to legalize abortion. Today in the US, the '
            'moment is indeed dark, and there are darker times ahead. Women, '
            'as ever, are fighting against that. Professor Terry McGovern, '
            'chair of the department of population and family health at the '
            'Columbia University medical center, was also arrested outside the '
            'supreme court that day. She points out that Texas already has a '
            'severe maternal mortality crisis with a disproportionate effect '
            'on Black women. “They’re not taking care of women and children,” '
            'she told me. “They have the worst health outcomes. And then '
            'they’re focusing on restricting women and girls and people’s '
            'bodily autonomy?” That is why she showed up on the steps of the '
            'supreme court, and that is why she will continue to fight. “It '
            'has absolutely always been true in history that when a law is as '
            'thoroughly amoral as this one, and it will be when they overturn '
            'Roe, that we have to do whatever we need to do to protect '
            'people’s health.” Maeve Higgins is a comedian and the author of '

{'article': 'It is Thursday morning at Home Park and, as the Plymouth manager '
            'Ryan Lowe says, there is no time to waste. Training starts across '
            'the way in nine minutes. His squad are preparing to face Ipswich '
            'before a bumper crowd of 16,087, their biggest for a league game '
            'since 2008. Perched above a tree-lined slope the performance '
            'analyst, Jimmy Dickinson, is filming the session. The pitches, '
            'spread over two tiers, are immaculate – perfect for their slick '
            'style – and the ball zips across the surface during a passing '
            'drill. Then comes some unit work, while rainbow-coloured corner '
            'flags flutter in the breeze. Lowe, a former Shrewsbury and Bury '
            'striker, moonlights as a defender as he takes the forwards for a '
            'shooting exercise while his assistant, Steven Schumacher, takes '
            'the midfielders. Adam Randell, a 21-year-old academy graduate, is '
            'practising pinging balls forward from a pivot position, until now '
            'home to the suspended Jordan Houghton. Two days later Randell is '
            'man of the match on his full league debut as Plymouth win to stay '
            'top of League One and extend their unbeaten streak to 15 league '
            'matches.\n'
            'The Pilgrims are not getting carried away but their progress is '
            'impossible to ignore. Eight years ago they avoided relegation to '
            'non-league on the final day and they finished 18th in the third '
            'tier last season. They have revamped their defence – only Swindon '
            'and Oldham conceded more goals in the top four tiers last season '
            '– and grown wedded to an attacking 3-5-2. “We try and play the '
            'formation no matter who we are playing against,” says the '
            'defender James Wilson, one of 10 summer signings. Recruitment is '
            'key. Plymouth work with Mrkt Insights, a data analytics company, '
            'to identify potential signings. “I liaise with them pretty much '
            'on a day-to-day basis,” says the director of football, Neil '
            'Dewsnip, pointing out they still have “foot soldiers” taking in '
            'games. “The data is a support mechanism – it is not the holy '
            'grail. The signoff is still very much at the end of a discussion '
            'between myself, Ryan and Andrew Parkinson, the CEO.” Dewsnip, who '
            'previously worked with England and Everton, has known Schumacher '
            'since the age of eight. “I was his first coach at Everton,” he '
            'says. “I was still a PE teacher in those days and he came to my '
            'school as well, so he got it both barrels. He’d always said: '
            '‘When I start to coach, would you help me, would you mentor me?’ '
            'We’re living that, really.”\n'
            'It explains why Schumacher and Lowe refer to Dewsnip, who also '
            'counts Steven Gerrard and the Oxford manager, Karl Robinson, '
            'among his former pupils, as “Mr D”. “I think Steven is still a '
            'little bit apprehensive about calling me by my first name because '
            'I would have challenged him as a young player over the years,” he '
            'says, laughing. “It is a term of endearment, I think.” Dewsnip’s '
            'contacts have enabled him to organise Zoom calls between '
            'Plymouth’s coaching staff and Gareth Southgate, Steve Holland and '
            'Anthony Barry, Chelsea’s first-team coach. Lowe, meanwhile, '
            'counts Gerrard as a longtime friend. Dewsnip, who is based in '
            'Cheshire, sometimes crashes at Lowe’s apartment in Plymouth and '
            'speaks with the manager “hourly, I think”. The day before a game, '
            'Dewsnip is on the grass at training. “Most technical directors or '
            'sporting directors are doing it from a recruitment point of view. '
            'I’m not so sure there is anybody else in my role that actually '
            'gets on the field and supports the manager and assistant manager '
            'in terms of the gameplan, the discussions we have about how to '
            'win games and so on.”\n'
            'Last weekend marked a decade since the club came out of '
            'administration and a handful of staff remain, including the kit '
            'manager, Neil Lunnon. Over the years Lunnon has seen various '
            'superstitions, including a striker who bought a pair of boots '
            'every time he went a couple of games without scoring, and a '
            'midfielder who requested Lunnon lug a pot of black pepper with '
            'him home and away. “Every game I would sprinkle it into his '
            'boots,” Lunnon says. The bloody noses Plymouth have given '
            'Sheffield Wednesday, whom they face in the FA Cup first round on '
            'Sunday, and Ipswich are even more impressive given they are '
            'working with a bottom-half budget. Sustainability is not just a '
            'buzzword at Argyle, who – with the caveats of receiving a £2.5m '
            'business interruption insurance payout in case of “communicable '
            'disease” and government support via the furlough scheme – posted '
            'a £376,000 profit despite playing almost all of last season '
            'behind closed doors. “You have clubs who chase the dream and '
            'probably overstep that and on the other hand you go to a '
            'situation where if you don’t spend the right amount of money, are '
            'you really competitive?” Parkinson says. “The answer is somewhere '
            'in the middle. We’re doing well on the pitch and off it.”\n'
            'Plymouth were one of the first clubs to hand use of their stadium '
            'to the NHS at the beginning of the pandemic and although the '
            'Captain’s Lounge in the revamped Mayflower Stand is still a '
            'vaccine centre, these days the main reason supporters are coming '
            'in their droves is to drink in what is happening on the field. A '
            'decade on from those struggles at the foot of League Two, those '
            'dark days are a distant memory. “The club is well structured, '
            'we’re in a better financial position,” Lowe smiles. “It is run '
            'better than it ever has been – and the football’s going OK as '
            'well.”',

            'With Me after finding, at parties, that the people he was '
            'chatting to often seemed eager to excuse themselves to go to the '
            'bathroom. Having struggled with insomnia since childhood, and '
            'finding most “sleep solutions” to be off-puttingly po-faced, '

            'eight-year-old daughter Lily. Charlie marches about town stapling '
            'missing posters to lamp-posts in the midst of an emotional '
            'breakdown or maybe even a psychotic episode – hallucinating, '
            'seeing her daughter in dark corners. Set in Georgia in the 1990s, '
            'the film opens a year after Lily vanishes. Tough but vulnerable '
            'Charlie is played beautifully by character actor Robyn Lively '
            '(half-sister of Blake) with a riveting less-is-more stillness. '
            'The local sheriff (Stan Houston) is ignoring her. Her partner '
            'Angela (Bethany Anne Lind) has walked out; homophobia already put '

{'article': 'Last July, the home secretary, Priti Patel, fired off a '
            'triumphant tweet: “We have published a clause to end so-called '
            '‘rough sex defence’ which enables perpetrators to avoid justice '
            'by claiming their victims consented to rough sex.” The tweet was '
            'the result of rising fury over cases such as that of Natalie '
            'Connolly, the 26-year-old mother from Worcestershire, who in 2016 '
            'bled to death after sustaining more than 40 injuries, which her '
            'partner, John Broadhurst, claimed occurred as part of consensual '
            'sex. (His account was believed and he served less than two years '
            'for manslaughter.) In 2018, the campaign group We Can’t Consent '
            'to This began collating cases and found that uses of the '
            'so-called “rough sex” defence increased tenfold between 1996 and '
            '2016 – and in 45% of cases had led to lesser charges of '
            'manslaughter rather than murder, or sometimes no charge at all. '
            'This weekend, the Sunday Times reported that nine British '
            'soldiers made jokes about “choking” a Kenyan mother, Agnes '
            'Wanjiru, whose body was found dumped in a septic tank in Nanyuki, '
            'Kenya. Following a local police inquiry, a 2019 inquest presided '
            'over by a Kenyan judge concluded that one or two British soldiers '
            'were responsible for the death, but the MoD took no further '
            'action. The subject of Patel’s tweet – section 71 of the Domestic '
            'Abuse Act (DAA), which states that a defendant cannot use the '
            'defence that the victim “consented to the infliction of the '
            'serious harm for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification” '
            '– was going to change all that. Except it has not. Barely a year '
            'later, on 7 September, Sam Pybus, from Middleton St George, a '
            'village near Darlington in County Durham, was sentenced to just '
            'four years and eight months after pleading guilty to the '
            'manslaughter of Sophie Moss, a vulnerable mother of two. (He '
            'could expect to serve half that; compare this with the sentence '
            'this month of Penelope Jackson, 66, who will serve a minimum of '
            '18 years for the murder of her husband, David Jackson, a man she '
            'claims was violent and coercively controlling; their daughter had '
            'seen him holding a knife to her mother’s throat.)\n'
            'At Pybus’s trial, the court heard that, late on a Saturday night '
            'last February, after drinking 24 bottles of Amstel lager, he left '
            'the home he shared with his wife, Louise Howitt (who was sleeping '
            'upstairs), and drove to Moss’s home in Darlington. Although Pybus '
            'claimed to recall little of what happened, Moss died after '
            '“sustained pressure” to her neck, something Pybus claimed Moss '
            '“enjoyed and encouraged” during sex. According to his account, '
            'Pybus awoke in the early hours to find his hands were hurting and '
            'Moss unresponsive beside him. Rather than administering first aid '
            'or dialling 999, he got dressed, left the flat and sat in his car '
            'for 15 minutes, deciding what to do. Then he drove to the police '
            'station to give his story. His lenient sentence has sparked '
            'another outcry – and been referred to the court of appeal by the '
            'attorney general. The case is currently expected to be heard on '
            '12 November. So what went wrong? Harriet Wistrich, the director '
            'of the Centre for Women’s Justice, who has spent decades fighting '
            'discrimination in the justice system around male violence against '
            'women, admits that even she was surprised by the Pybus case, '
            'occurring so soon after the new clause was enacted. “I think it’s '
            'an embarrassment to the government that, having passed this law, '
            'heralded as a new intervention, you get the same outcome,” she '
            'says. “In a sense, though, the DAA amendment did little more than '
            'codify what had already been determined. The legal principle that '
            'a person cannot legally consent to being injured or killed was '
            'already established. The amendment doesn’t outlaw ‘rough sex’ as '
            'a defence.” In cases like Pybus’s, Broadhurst’s or any other '
            'so-called “sex game gone wrong”, the critical issue is not the '
            'victim’s consent – it is the defendant’s intent. And the judge in '
            'Pybus’s case accepted that he did not intend to kill. A murder '
            'charge requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that someone '
            'intended to cause serious harm or death – and a statement from '
            'the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) North East claimed that, with '
            'Pybus, the evidence for this was insufficient. “For me, the most '
            'concerning thing is, first, the way the case was investigated,” '
            'says Wistrich. “Was it with a view to determine whether Pybus was '
            'dangerous and a risk to women, or was it a search for evidence to '
            'stand up his story? Second, the readiness with which the CPS '
            'seemed to accept that evidence, instead of putting it to a jury, '
            'is impossible for me to understand. Third, the length of the '
            'sentence just seems so inappropriate.”\n'
            'Some of those closest to the case agree. Howitt, Pybus’s '
            'estranged wife, and Daniel Parkington, Moss’s former partner and '
            'the father of her children, have been shocked by how quickly and '
            'easily Pybus’s narrative slipped through. “The police told me at '
            'the very start that the charge would probably be downgraded to '
            'manslaughter,” says Parkington. “It always felt like they were '
            'accepting the easy option. If it’s tricky to take this person to '
            'court for murder and let a jury decide, you get the sense that '
            'they’d rather accept a guilty plea to manslaughter and go for the '
            'slam dunk, the tick in the box. Move on. Next case.” Parkington, '
            '39, who works for his family’s telecom business, lives 10 miles '
            'from Darlington with the boys, aged five and six, he fathered '
            'with Moss. He met Moss nine years ago when she worked in a stable '
            'yard and as a personal trainer in the local gym. “She was a '
            'hardworking girl with so much charm and charisma,” he says. “When '
            'Sophie entered a room, you knew she was there. I first introduced '
            'her to my family at my mum’s 60th birthday dinner. They were '
            'amazed by how perfect she was. And she was perfect.” The couple '
            'moved to a tiny cottage in the village of Bolton-on-Swale, North '
            'Yorkshire, before relocating to Darlington just before their '
            'first son was born. After six years, they separated – Parkington '
            'says Moss’s deteriorating mental health and alcohol dependence '
            'were factors, although he stresses that he carries much of the '
            'blame. It was, he says, in the boys’ best interests that the '
            'couple lived apart. Parkington had custody, but Moss remained '
            'central to all their lives. She would meet them at the school '
            'gates most mornings to see the boys into school. They would '
            'FaceTime every evening. They stayed with her on a weekly basis. '
            'Parkington would bring food to Moss at her flat and order her '
            'takeaways to make sure she was eating – two months before she was '
            'killed, she was seriously ill in hospital with liver and kidney '
            'infections. There was no doubt that Moss was extremely vulnerable '
            'to abuse. Parkington says he had witnessed one male visitor '
            'arrive at her flat at 9am with two bottles of wine. He had seen '
            'another – a local solicitor – bring wine in his lunch hour. “I '
            'used to tell Sophie’s friends that, if we didn’t stop this, one '
            'day she’ll turn round and say: ‘I’m not in the mood,’ and some '
            'man is going to kill her.” There were also, he says, high value '
            'items going missing from her flat, and money disappearing from '
            'her account on a monthly basis. (Parkington is convinced that '
            'CCTV footage at her local cash machine would confirm that someone '
            'else was using her card.)\n'
            'On the night Moss was killed – before Pybus had arrived at her '
            'flat – she had texted Parkington and asked him to order a taxi to '
            'take her to hospital, as her ankles were swollen and she was '
            'struggling to walk. Unfortunately, Parkington was already asleep '
            'and did not see it until the morning. He refuses to accept that, '
            'just hours after texting him, Moss died by accident as a result '
            'of consensual choking. Parkington says: “When the police told me, '
            'I immediately said: ‘No way.’ She didn’t enjoy that type of '
            'thing. I knew Sophie better than anybody. She had the lowest pain '
            'threshold of anyone I’ve ever known. Sophie’s long-term boyfriend '
            'told the police the same thing. But the police accepted the '
            'account of Pybus and another unidentified person who used to '
            'visit her, who was not put in front of a jury to decide whether '
            'he was credible. All the judge heard were good character '
            'references for Pybus, and his terrible remorse.” Howitt, a '
            'teacher studying for a PhD in linguistics, agrees that the '
            'investigation did not delve deeply. When the police arrived at '
            'her house on the Sunday morning, their first question was: “‘Did '
            'Sam ever strangle you in bed?’ It seemed like they took his '
            'narrative then looked for evidence to support it,” she says. '
            '“They were concentrating so much on: ‘What did he do?’ and: ‘How '
            'did he do it?’ The truth is that, yes, there were things he did '
            'to me when I was young and a bit naive and at the time I thought: '
            '‘This is what people do.’ But it’s really important that there '
            'were never any conversations about it first. Sam never, ever '
            'asked before he did it. “The police didn’t dig any deeper about '
            'our marriage,” continues Howitt. She claims that Pybus had got '
            'the couple into £10,000 of debt due to reckless spending and '
            'payday loans. At one point, she had discovered he was texting '
            'numerous local women and sleeping with Moss, but whenever she '
            'tried to leave, Pybus would break down and threaten to kill '
            'himself. “He was so good at manipulating you and making you feel '
            'sorry for him,” she says. “If they’d really looked into Sam’s '
            'history with women, they would have found abuse, sexual violence '
            'and just a complete lack of respect.” (Another former partner '
            'wrote on Facebook when the case became news: “I’m just gonna put '
            'this out there before all the messages flood in. Yes, this is '
            'THAT Sam … I just hope that now nearly 10 years later those '
            'people who didn’t believe my words as a young 19-year-old girl or '
            'judged me without knowing both sides now know what this boy is '
            'capable of.”) Once the police had confirmed that Pybus had '
            'practised strangulation during sex in the past, and once the CPS '
            'had accepted his manslaughter plea, there was still scope for a '
            'lengthier sentence. Much depended on the judge’s decision around '
            'Pybus’s culpability, which can range from very high to low. '
            'According to sentencing guidelines, high culpability includes '
            'cases where death resulted from “an unlawful act which carried a '
            'high risk of death or GBH which was or ought to be obvious to the '
            'offender”. This carries a sentence range of between eight and 16 '
            'years. Instead, Pybus seems to have been deemed to have had '
            'medium culpability, which carries a sentence range of three to '
            'nine years. On top of this would be a reduction for a guilty '
            'plea, and possible mitigating factors such as remorse and good '
            'character. (It seems an injustice that use of a weapon is an '
            'aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing, whereas '
            'strangulation, the second most common method of femicide, is '
            'not.)\n'
            'Fiona Mackenzie, the founder of We Can’t Consent to This, has '
            'found the case hugely disappointing. “What’s so upsetting, right '
            'after the new amendment, is that it’s immediately been '
            'demonstrated that police are not getting it, the CPS are not '
            'getting it and the judge did not get it,” she says. “So what is '
            'the government going to do? Do we need more training? New '
            'guidelines for prosecution or sentencing?” In the meantime, she '
            'hopes the impending appeal will increase Pybus’s sentence. '
            'Wistrich, along with We Can’t Consent to This, is exploring the '
            'possibility of bringing a third-party intervention to the appeal, '
            'to introduce additional points for consideration from witnesses '
            'including Howitt, who remains adamant that justice was not '
            'served. “Sam has written from prison,” she says. “His letters are '
            'infuriating – all about making me feel sorry for him. He says '
            'he’s so depressed, he has nothing in common with the other '
            'prisoners. Not once has he ever said he was sorry for killing '
            'Sophie or taking her away from her children.” Moss’s sons still '
            'call for their mum when they fall or hurt themselves. When Moss '
            'was killed, the UK was in lockdown, so, at home in his little '
            'bubble, Parkington put off telling his boys for several weeks. It '
            'was only when schools were reopening that he told them their '
            'mummy had been in hospital again and this time doctors couldn’t '
            'save her. Sophie loved cats – she had four when she died, three '
            'of them rescues. The boys have taken one each. “They love them '
            'and I’m sure it keeps their memories of their mummy more recent,” '
            'says Parkington. “We can’t kid ourselves, though. There’s Google. '
            'They only need to type in their mum’s name and all this will be '
            'there – and by the time that happens, the man who killed her '
            'could be out and free. “It consumes me. I think about it every '
            'minute of every day. It makes me so, so angry and that anger '
            'isn’t all at him. A lot of it is to do with these people in '
            'powerful positions who make decisions that just aren’t right. No '
            'sentence would be long enough in my mind, but how can this one '
            'ever be seen as fair? If the appeal isn’t successful, then I just '
            'lose all faith. Surely there have got to be some good people out '
            'there.”',

{'article': 'How can you hold climate talks without including the most '
            'affected people? You can’t. How can you make decisions on the '
            'best way to adapt to climate impacts without talking to those '
            'forced to adapt? You can’t. And how can you deliver climate '
            'justice by continuing to ignore those that are suffering the '
            'most? You can’t. As the Cop26 climate summit gets under way, and '
            'the so-called leaders of the world take centre stage to deliver '
            'yet more empty promises, we – five youth climate activists from '
            'five of the most affected areas across Africa, Asia, Central '
            'America and the South Pacific – have arrived despite attempts to '
            'shut us out. We have sailed into Glasgow onboard the Rainbow '
            'Warrior to let these presidents, prime ministers, policymakers '
            'and CEOs know that our voices will no longer remain unheard. They '
            'cannot and should not have these talks without us and we’re '
            'demanding a seat at the table to make sure they finally act. The '
            'climate crisis is a global crisis that requires global action. '
            'But it does not affect everyone in the same way. It’s a crisis of '
            'inequalities. We are all in the same storm, but we are not all in '
            'the same boat. Today there are five times more extreme weather '
            'events – devastating storms, floods, droughts, water scarcity and '
            'heatwaves – than 50 years ago, and they disproportionately affect '
            'those of us living in the most vulnerable areas, especially in '
            'the global south. Last year, climate disasters displaced more '
            'people from our communities than war and violent conflict, again '
            'mostly from the global south. Yet we are not the ones that have '
            'caused this crisis. Since 1965, one-third of global emissions, '
            'driven by the relentless exploitation of fossil fuels, have been '
            'caused by just 20 companies. Rich nations are responsible for 92% '
            'of global emissions, with the US and countries in Europe causing '
            'almost two-thirds of those. We’re just the ones forced to live '
            'with, or sadly in many cases die because of, its impacts. Yet our '
            'voices continue to be sidelined. In our home countries of '
            'Namibia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Mexico and Tuvalu in the South '
            'Pacific, we face many different challenges. But they are all '
            'exacerbated by the same injustices such as gender violence, '
            'forced migration and racial injustices, as well as the Covid-19 '
            'pandemic and the climate crisis. These are all symptoms of the '
            'same rotten system. We have friends who have dropped out of '
            'school because droughts have forced their families into poverty '
            'and famine. Others are forced to literally sell their children in '
            'order to meet their basic needs. Many people have lost land, '
            'homes and crops to floods and rising sea levels. More are being '
            'forced to flee their homes and communities. And even just '
            'accessing safe drinking water is a daily struggle for many. '
            'Thousands of people are dying right now because of the climate '
            'crisis: the world leaders at this summit have blood on their '
            'hands. While corporate greed and a failure to act from '
            'governments in the global north are driving climate change, the '
            'disparities between rich and impoverished, between those who are '
            'causing this crisis and those who are not, don’t end there. The '
            'inequalities also run deep within our countries. Corruption and '
            'neocolonialism are rife. Communities are displaced by industry as '
            'politicians sell off our land to oil companies, promising '
            'prosperity and jobs for local people who have been forced deeper '
            'into poverty by the climate crisis. Our communities are being '
            'misled. Those jobs never come, but the pollution, environmental '
            'destruction – along with emotional and cultural destruction – and '
            'more severe climate impacts always do. For over a decade, rich '
            'nations have failed to deliver the international climate finance '
            'that they have promised. This is not aid, nor just the help '
            'they’re obliged to provide. This is a debt that they owe us for '
            'the environmental death and destruction that they have caused – '
            'and it must be paid in full. What little of this debt that '
            'actually is repaid rarely reaches those who need it. But no one '
            'questions our governments. No one checks up on how this money is '
            'being spent. Policies put in place to protect our local '
            'environments are meaningless while corrupt politicians remain in '
            'charge. But speaking out in our countries can result in grave '
            'consequences. We are literally putting our lives on the line – so '
            'it is imperative that our voices are heard. The leaders gathering '
            'in Glasgow have failed to act on the science. They have failed '
            'for decades to tackle the climate crisis. And they have failed to '
            'listen to people from the most affected areas who are now '
            'suffering from the consequences of their failure to act. Enough '
            'is enough. We are here to let them know that we will continue to '
            'fight for climate justice until they stop failing us. They must '
            'not deny us the platform to freely defend our present and '
            'futures. They must not ignore our demands. And they must not '
            'continue to put profit over people and the planet. The system '
            'must be uprooted before it is too late. This article was written '

{'article': 'Good morning. World leaders have agreed a deal that aims to halt '

            'a multibillion-dollar package to tackle human-caused greenhouse '

            'control methane, regarded by the administration as the single '
            'most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. '
            'Leading an alliance of 90 countries, including for the first time '
            'Brazil, he will set out new regulatory measures today to limit '
            'global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of '
            'the decade. Major producers and consumers of deforestation-linked '
            'commodities including Indonesia, China and Brazil have put their '
            'name to the deforestation deal, which aims to curtail the '
            'second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The detailed '
            'US proposals on methane gases may prove to be one of the lasting '
            'successes of Cop26 in Glasgow where Biden will announce his '
            'action plan. On Monday, Biden urged other world leaders to embark '
            'upon a shift to clean energy and vowed that the US will ‘lead by '
            'example’. California legalized weed five years ago. Why is the '
            'illicit market still thriving?\n'
            'Five years after cannabis legalization, California is awash with '
            'signs of an apparently booming industry. Californians can toke on '
            'Justin Bieber-branded joints and ash their blunts in Seth Rogen’s '
            '$95 ceramics. They can sip on THC-infused seltzers, relax inside '
            'a cannabis cafe and get edibles delivered to their doors. But '
            'behind the flashy facade, the legal weed industry remains far '
            'from the law-abiding, prosperous sector many had hoped for. In '
            'fact, it’s a mess. Voters passed a law in November 2016 making '
            'recreational marijuana legal. But today, the vast majority of the '
            'market remains underground – about 80-90% of it, according to '
            'experts. Because that 2016 law, known as Proposition 64, gave '
            'municipalities the power to ban weed as they see fit, the '
            'majority of cities and counties still don’t allow the sale of '
            'cannabis, inhibiting the growth of the legal market. What else is '
            'causing the illegal market to thrive? Business owners say high '
            'taxes, the limited availability of licenses, and expensive '
            'regulatory costs have put the legal market out of reach. How do '
            'those who are licensed to sell cannabis legally stay afloat? For '
            'now, the only way legal, state-licensed businesses say they are '
            'able to stay profitable is to keep one foot in the illegal, '
            'unlicensed market. Republican senator Josh Hawley worries '
            'feminism has driven men to ‘pornography and video games’\n'
            'The effort to combat toxic masculinity in the US has led men to '
            'consume more pornography and play more video games, the Missouri '
            'senator Josh Hawley claimed in a speech to a group of '
            'Republicans. Speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in '
            'Orlando, Florida, Hawley addressed the issue of “manhood”, which '
            'he said was under attack, and called for men to return to '
            'traditional masculine roles. The Donald Trump supporter who '
            'notoriously raised a fist in support of a mob outside the US '
            'Capitol on 6 January appeared to echo talking points made by the '
            'likes of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that opposes feminism '
            'and believes men are under attack from liberal elites. “Can we be '
            'surprised that after years of being told that they are the '
            'problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are '
            'withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and '
            'video games?” Hawley said. Hawley did not cite sources for his '
            'belief that men were watching pornography more frequently. '
            'Nonetheless, on Monday his speech was republished by the '
            'Federalist, a rightwing outlet. Hawley is the son of a banker and '
            'attended private school before studying at Stanford and Yale. '
            'Given his background, he has repeatedly raised eyebrows for '
            'railing against elites and claiming to speak for all men. In '

            'reporters were attacked in their own homes in less than 24 hours, '

            'violence may be necessary to ‘save’ US\n'
            'Almost a third of Republicans believe violence may be necessary '
            'to “save” the US, according to a poll. Researchers at the Public '
            'Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit, found that 30% of '
            'Republicans agreed with the statement: “Because things have '
            'gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to '
            'resort to violence in order to save our country.” Among Americans '
            'who believe the 2020 election was “stolen” from Donald Trump, '
            'which it was not, 39% believe violence may be required. Don’t '

            'gym, become a marathon runner or walk miles a day after the age '

            'shift from active parenting or full-time work, may all '

{'article': 'A Guardian investigation has revealed that a controversial church '
            'whose leader has openly expressed the ambition of creating a '
            '“theocracy” in America has accumulated significant influence in '
            'the city of Moscow, Idaho.\n'
            'Christ Church has a stated goal to “make Moscow a Christian town” '
            'and public records, interviews, and open source materials online '
            'show how its leadership has extended its power and activities in '
            'the town. Church figures have browbeaten elected officials over '
            'Covid restrictions, built powerful institutions in parallel to '
            'secular government, harassed perceived opponents, and accumulated '
            'land and businesses in pursuit of a long-term goal of '
            'transforming America into a nation ruled according to its own, '
            'ultra-conservative moral precepts. The rise of Christ Church may '
            'be playing out in a small Idaho city but it comes at a time when '
            'the US is roiled by the far right, including Christian '
            'nationalism, and when social conservatives are seeking to roll '
            'back basic tenets of US life such as legal abortion, as well as '
            'dominating powerful national institutions, such as the supreme '
            'court. While the church’s previous controversies have centered on '
            'its founder and pastor, Douglas Wilson, a new generation of male '
            'church leaders – including Wilson’s son – have found ways to '
            'expand the church’s reach in Moscow and beyond, even gaining '
            'footholds in mainstream popular culture in the broader US. In '
            'recent months, Christ Church has advocated for resistance to '
            'Covid mandates in Moscow, and Wilson has attempted to give '
            'theological ballast to opposition to restrictions and vaccination '
            'programs, as well as warning of political violence. Last month, a '
            'video version of a post by Wilson at his well-read blog was '
            'removed from YouTube. The blogpost, entitled “A Biblical Defense '
            'of Fake Vaccine IDs”, was based on a conspiracy theory asserting '
            'that the vaccine response was a “power play” on the part of the '
            'Biden administration, which intended to leave the restrictions in '
            'place permanently. Wilson further claimed that “we are not yet in '
            'a hot civil war, with shooting and all, but we are in a cold '
            'war/civil war” and urged readers to “resist openly, in concert '
            'with any others in your same position”, claiming that this would '
            'not be “rebellion against lawful authority” but “an example of a '
            'free people refusing to go along with their own enslavement”. The '
            'post was met with outrage, including from other prominent '
            'evangelicals. That was not the only time that Wilson’s activities '
            'and positions have led to criticism from other evangelicals, and '
            'associations with Wilson have led to crises in other churches. In '
            'recent months, members and clergy resigned from Minneapolis’s '
            'Bethlehem Baptist church, and staff resigned from its associated '
            'Bethlehem College and Seminary (BCS), in part over the appearance '
            'of newly appointed BCS president Joe Rigney on Man Rampant, a '
            'video series hosted by Wilson and streamed on platforms including '
            'Amazon Prime. The show promotes Wilson’s long-held position that '
            'men need to assert themselves in society. Christ Church was '
            'founded in Moscow in the 1990s, and experts who have studied the '
            'church estimate the size of the congregation and its offshoot '
            'churches at about 2,000, or 10% of the city’s total population. '
            'But they also say that the church is increasingly drawing people '
            'to the area who are attracted to the idea of northern Idaho as a '
            'conservative “redoubt” against American modernity, and by the '
            'church’s “reconstructionist” position, which holds that the world '
            'will need to be governed according to their interpretation of '
            'biblical morality before Christ returns to earth. Christ Church’s '
            'previous controversies have garnered national attention. Recent '
            'reporting focused attention once more on the church’s – and '
            'Wilson’s – handling of a series of sexual abuse cases, and the '
            'theological subordination of women. In 2005, Wilson asked a judge '
            'for leniency in the case of Stephen Sitler, a former student at a '
            'Christ Church-aligned college, New Saint Andrews College (NSAC). '
            'Sitler was at that time convicted of sex offenses involving '
            'children. After his release on probation in 2007, Sitler was '
            'married in Christ Church in 2010, by Wilson, to a woman who, by '
            'Sitler’s and her account, had been introduced to him by Edwin '
            'Iverson, then a Christ Church elder and now pastor of a Council '
            'of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) church in Colville, '
            'Washington. Wilson has faced scrutiny over other positions. In '
            'the early 2000s, Wilson received criticism over a book, Southern '
            'Slavery as it Was, which he had co-written in the previous decade '
            'with J Steven Wilkins. Wilkins is a Louisiana pastor who was a '
            'co-founder of the neo-Confederate organization, the League of the '
            'South. His church is a member of Wilson’s congregational umbrella '
            'group, the CREC. The book depicted slavery in the antebellum '
            'southern United States as “a relationship based upon mutual '
            'affection and confidence”, and argued that the enslaved enjoyed '
            '“a life of plenty, of simple pleasures, of food, clothes, and '
            'good medical care”. Wilson has repeatedly disavowed any interest '
            'in national electoral politics, but Christ Church’s eventual aim '
            'is what Wilson explicitly describes in a 2016 book as '
            '“theocracy”, or “a network of nations bound together by a formal '
            'acknowledgement of the lordship of Jesus Christ”, as opposed to '
            'secular society ruled by “civil governments, [which] are in '
            'necessary degrees satanic, demonic, and influenced by the god of '
            'this world, who is the devil”. These beliefs have led Christ '
            'Church into conflicts with local government, but additionally, '
            'Wilson and other Christ Church members have founded a range of '
            'local and national institutions which are affiliated with or '
            'sponsored by the church. Christ Church itself is an '
            'unincorporated nonprofit, which means that it is not obliged to '
            'provide details of its finances to government authorities. Many '
            'entities associated with the church are either also '
            'unincorporated, like the Logos School, or, like publisher Canon '
            'Press, are operated by a network of limited liability companies '
            '(LLCs) which are similarly limited in their accountability. But '
            'insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity said that all '
            'members tithe 10% of their household income, and wealthier '
            'members are expected to make an even larger contribution. Within '
            'a network of educational institutions, publishing houses, '
            'churches, and national associations that Wilson has founded or '
            'led, a small number of men, from a small number of families, have '
            'come to exert significant power within the organisation and '
            'Moscow. Not least among these is Wilson’s own family, with him as '
            'its head.\n'
            'At NSAC, for example, the college president is Wilson’s '
            'son-in-law, Ben Merkle. Another son-in-law, Luke Jankovic, sits '
            'on the board of trustees, as does Wilson himself and Christ '
            'Church’s associate pastor, Toby Sumpter. Douglas Wilson is also '
            'on faculty at NSAC, and is listed as a senior fellow in theology. '
            'Also on faculty are his son Nathan (ND) Wilson, a fellow of '
            'literature; and his brother, Gordon Wilson, a self-described '
            '“young earth creationist” who believes that God created the earth '
            'in seven days, is senior fellow of natural history. According to '
            'tax filings, Merkle and Gordon Wilson each draw salaries from the '
            'college, which lists tuition and costs for undergraduate students '
            'at $19,900 per year. Merkle, Jankovic, and all three Wilson men '
            'are also elders at Christ Church, along with a founding director '
            'and former trustee at NSAC, Moscow resident Andrew Crapuchettes. '
            'Until June 2021, when the company was acquired by a competitor, '
            'Crapuchettes had been chief executive of Moscow’s largest private '
            'employer, EMSI, for more than 19 years. During that period, EMSI '
            'was a major employer of NSAC graduates. According to LinkedIn '
            'data, there are 55 current employees at EMSI who are NSAC '
            'graduates, from a college which has graduated only 635 people '
            'throughout its history. In addition, a number of Christ Church '
            'elders hold senior positions at EMSI. They include Luke Jankovic '
            '– the NSAC trustee who is Wilson’s son-in-law – who is now '
            'executive vice-president of higher education. Also, EMSI’s chief '
            'operations officer and chief financial officer is Timothy van den '
            'Broek, a teaching elder at Trinity Reformed church, Christ '
            'Church’s suburban offshoot. Van den Broek began his career at '
            'EMSI immediately after graduating from NSAC, and he sits on the '
            'boards of church-aligned businesses and organizations, including '
            'their charity, the Hope Center, and Classic Learning Initiatives, '
            'which aims to devise alternative standardized testing for '
            'students at Christian private schools who wish to attend private '
            'Christian universities like NSAC. Since his departure from EMSI, '
            'Andrew Crapuchettes has started a new venture, a jobs website '
            'called Red Balloon, which advertises itself as connecting '
            '“employers who value freedom with employees who value it too”, in '
            '“a world beyond cancel culture, where employees are free to work '
            '… without fear that they will find themselves on the wrong side '
            'of their employer’s politics”. Many of the website’s initial '
            'clients appeared to be either church run or founded '
            'organizations, or companies belonging to other church members. '
            'Now, Crapuchettes has branched out into property development, and '
            'this year won approval from Moscow city council for the '
            '“annexation” of 27 acres of land on Moscow’s south-western edge '
            'for a new, 109 unit subdivision called Edington. A local '
            'businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the '
            'church already had a disproportionate presence in the downtown '
            'area, and that developments like Edington were evidence that '
            '“they are trying to attract more people here”. He added that the '
            'church’s anti-mask and anti-vaccination positions, as well as its '
            'attempts to “take over local institutions” like a food co-op, had '
            'polarized the community. He also referred to an ad for New Saint '
            'Andrews College that had been seen as transphobic by many in '
            'Moscow had “galvanized the town against them”. He called it a '
            'demonstration of the church’s preparedness “to throw red meat and '
            'recruit on the basis of hate”. In response to detailed emailed '
            'questions about various aspects of Christ Church’s operations, '
            'Douglas Wilson did not offer any specific response, but wrote '
            'that the Guardian’s “approach illustrates an absurd fixation and '
            'anti-church bigotry that we have come to expect from certain '
            'elements of the leftist media”. Asked about EMSI’s hiring '
            'practices under his leadership, Andrew Crapuchettes wrote that: '
            '“Under my watch, EMSI grew into a global company with offices on '
            'two continents, and in an ever-tightening labor market, we hired '
            'talent wherever we could find it, including from the 3 local '
            'colleges – Washington State, University of Idaho and New Saint '
            'Andrews.”',

            'indefensible. Anyone can use Delphi. Users just put a question to '
            'the bot on its website, and see what it comes up with. The AI is '
            'fed a vast number of scenarios – including ones from the popular '
            'Am I The Asshole sub-Reddit, where Reddit users post dilemmas '
            'from their personal lives and get an audience to judge who the '
            'asshole in the situation was. Then, people are recruited from '
            'Mechanical Turk – a market place where researchers find paid '
            'participants for studies – to say whether they agree with the '
            'AI’s answers. Each answer is put to three arbiters, with the '

            'project alongside colleagues at the Allen Institute for AI, about '
            'how Delphi thinks about these questions. She said: “It’s '
            'sensitive to how you phrase the question. Even though we might '
            'think you have to be consistent, in reality, humans do use '
            'innuendos and implications and qualifications. I think Delphi is '
            'trying to read what you are after, just in the way that you '
            'phrase it.” With this in mind, we tried to pose some of the great '
            'questions of politics, culture and literature.\n'

            'The bot does answer some questions with striking nuance. For '
            'example, it distinguishes whether it is rude to mow the lawn late '
            'at night (it is rude), versus whether it is OK to mow the lawn '
            'late at night when your neighbor is out of town (it is OK). But '
            'previous versions of the bot answered Vox’s question “Is genocide '
            'OK” with: “If it makes everybody happy.” A new version of Delphi, '

            'world where people are constantly asking answers of imperfect '
            'people, and tools – like Reddit threads and Google. “And the '
            'internet is filled with all sorts of problematic content. You '
            'know, some people say they should spread fake news, for example, '
            'in order to support their political party,” she says. So you '
            'could argue that all this really tells us is whether the bot’s '
            'views are consistent with a random selection of people’s, rather '

            'the bot is not to be a moral authority on anything. “People '
            'outside AI are playing with that demo, [when] I thought only '

            'to support.” Instead, the point of the bot is to help AI to work '
            'better with humans, and to weed out some of the many biases we '
            'already know it has. “We have to teach AI ethical values because '

{'article': 'West Australian police are using drones and aircraft to create a '
            'detailed map of the Blowholes campsite as they look for '
            '“disturbances in the sand” during the ongoing investigation into '
            'the disappearance of four-year-old Cleo Smith. Police recruits '
            'are also sifting through a mountain of rubbish collected from '
            'roadside bins stretching more than 600km along Western '
            'Australia’s north-west coast in the hope of finding any clue that '
            'could lead to Cleo. The four-year-old vanished from the Blowholes '
            'campsite on the coast of Macleod, about 950km north of Perth, on '
            '16 October. Her mum, Ellie Smith, was the last known person to '
            'see her when the family were camping almost three weeks ago. She '
            'said her daughter woke about 1.30am asking for water before going '
            'back to bed. In the morning Cleo and her sleeping bag were gone '
            'from the family’s tent. Acting police commissioner Col Blanch on '
            'Tuesday said the force was using drones as they looked to “map '
            'every inch” of the area.\n'
            '“We are looking for disturbances in sand,” he told ABC radio. '
            '“We’ve used satellite technology, we used aircraft to take '
            'high-definition photos. We really need to make a good quality '
            'mapping of that area to make sure that we cover every inch.” '
            'Blanch said the initial search focused on looking for Cleo if she '
            'had potentially wandered off. “Now we are in a stage where we '
            'need to forensically go over that ground inch by inch to see what '
            'disturbances might be in the nearby areas for any sort of '
            'evidence that might give an inkling as to what happened,” he said '
            'on Tuesday. Authorities are conducting line searches too. WA '
            'police had previously said there was nothing to suggest the '
            'account given by Cleo’s parents was anything but “accurate and '
            'truthful”. Guardian Australia is not suggesting they were '
            'involved in Cleo’s disappearance. More than 50 cubic metres of '
            'rubbish has been collected from bins stretching as far south as '
            'Geraldton, more than 500km from where Cleo vanished, and as far '
            'north as Minilya, 165km away. WA police believe Cleo may have '
            'been abducted, with the state government offering a $1m reward '
            'for any information that helps them find the people or person '
            'responsible for her disappearance. The rubbish was packed into '
            'trucks and transported to Perth where four forensics officers and '
            '20 officers spent days sorting through hundreds of bags in an '
            'effort to find any items that may assist in the investigation. '
            'The search of the rubbish was “still going on today and will take '
            'a while to get through,” Blanch said on Tuesday. He said police '
            'were still looking for a vehicle they believed turned off '
            'Blowholes Road about 3.30am on the day Cleo went missing and '
            'drove south towards Carnarvon along the coast road. The acting '
            'commissioner said it was thought to be a “smaller passenger-type '
            'vehicle”. That sighting remained a “significant focus of the '
            'investigation,” he said. Blanch said given the remoteness of the '
            'area there were some potential routes from the campsite to '
            'Carnarvon without any CCTV coverage. Asked if Cleo could have '
            'been watched or followed at the campsite, he said investigators '
            'were keeping an open mind so “all avenues are still a '
            'possibility”. But the detective leading the investigation, Det '
            'Supt Rod Wilde, believes she was likely taken by an '
            '“opportunistic” offender. Wilde said on Tuesday the family had '
            'stayed near their tent all evening and had not socialised with '
            'other campers. “I think it’s more than likely an '
            'opportunistic-type event,” he told Perth radio 6PR. “We know they '
            'got there on the Friday night, it was getting dark, and there '
            'would have been limited opportunity for people to observe Cleo at '
            'that time.” There are 100 people on the taskforce searching for '
            'Cleo – 50 locally and 50 in Perth. The working theory is that she '
            'was still in WA because it was a “high-risk proposition” someone '
            'would try and take her out of the state, Blanch said. He called '
            'on people in the community to look out for anyone they knew '
            'behaving strangely “or a little bit off” after 16 October. The '
            'acting commissioner said it was difficult to remain hopeful as '
            'the search dragged on but investigators were “focused absolutely '
            'on this case trying to bring Cleo home”. Crime Stoppers have had '
            '200 possible sightings of Cleo since she went missing and members '
            'of the public have come forward with hours of CCTV and dashcam '
            'footage in the hope that it helps.\n'

{'article': 'An exclusive London casino racially discriminated against one of '
            'its dealers by allowing a request by a patron not to have black '
            'dealers at their table, an employment tribunal has found. Semhar '
            'Tesfagiorgis, 41, successfully sued Crown London Aspinalls, in '
            'Mayfair, over an incident in December 2019, when she and a black '
            'colleague were prevented from working at the table of a patron '
            'who had requested “females with fair skin”. The casino had tried '
            'to argue that the reason for not allowing Tesfagiorgis and her '
            'colleague to deal to the patron was not because of race but '
            'because of the perception that it was necessary to accommodate '
            'patrons’ request, no matter how unreasonable, in order to the '
            'further the interests of the business. This was rejected by the '
            'three-person panel sitting at London central employment tribunal, '
            'led by Judge Elliot. In a written judgment, it said: “Our finding '
            'is that the claimant and her black female colleagues were held '
            'back from going on duty because they were not ‘fair-skinned, '
            'female dealers’ or ‘western-looking female staff’ … “The '
            'accommodation of the request was direct race discrimination of '
            'the claimant because but for her race she would have been asked '
            'to deal to the patron. The granting of that request was less '
            'favourable treatment by the managers because of race.”\n'
            'The tribunal also found that a complaint relating to an incident '
            'in June 2015 would have succeeded as an act of direct race '
            'discrimination but was time-barred because the claim had been '
            'brought too late. In that incident, Aspinalls refused to '
            'accommodate a request by Tesfagiorgis for a shift swap because a '
            'patron did not want a black female dealer. The panel said: “The '
            'shift swap was refused because of the claimant’s race: she did '
            'not fit the patron’s requirement for ‘white female dealers only’, '
            'which the respondent accommodated. The reason the claimant was '
            'not one of the patron’s preferred dealers is because she was not '
            'white. The refusal of the shift swap was less favourable '
            'treatment of the claimant because of her race.” The panel noted '
            'that the casino had only one slide on a presentation given during '
            'training that dealt with patrons’ behaviour, describing the '
            'training as “inadequate”. Comparing her victory to David versus '
            'Goliath, Tesfagiorgis, who worked as an inspector/dealer at '
            'Aspinalls between 2007 and 2020, said: “I tried for many years to '
            'open a dialogue about the racism myself and many others were '
            'often faced with but I was either shut down, ignored or '
            'gaslighted each time. “The direct discrimination myself and other '
            'black colleagues received was not an isolated incident. Although '
            'the tribunal could not rule on past events due to time limits, '
            'they have acknowledged this was the case and for once Crown '
            'Aspinalls will finally be forced to do the same, for this I am '
            'grateful to the employment tribunal.” Her solicitor, Shazia Khan, '
            'a founding partner of Cole Khan, said she hoped the judgment led '
            'to “root-and-branch reform of the casino and gaming industry to '
            'address the racist and sexist conduct that drove my client out of '
            'a career she clearly loved”.',

{'article': 'There was a worry that when theatres reopened after months of '
            'pandemic-enforced closure, programming might be risk averse, with '
            'ambitions constrained by strapped finances. Al Smith’s Rare Earth '
            'Mettle is not a constrained play. It is a multi-stranded, '
            'multi-character, continent-hopping drama that centres on the '
            'Bolivian salt flats but encompasses numerous plotlines and '
            'locations. It was commissioned pre-pandemic – they were midway '
            'through rehearsals when theatres closed in March last year – but '
            'the Royal Court has remained committed to bringing it to the '
            'stage. Smith’s protagonist, Hershel Fink, is an Elon Musk-esque '
            'billionaire who believes he can save the world by building '
            'electric cars. He’ll get richer in the process of course, which '
            'he’s fine with. Local indigenous communities also want to benefit '
            'from the deal. Smith had wanted to address climate change, but he '
            'felt that a lot of the theatre that did so either took the form '
            'of a lecture – Katie Mitchell’s Ten Billion, for example – or had '
            'a dystopian approach. Neither of those routes appealed. He had '
            'been reading about the Lithium Triangle, a region of the Andes '
            'that is thought to hold around 54% of the world’s lithium '
            'reserves, and he started reading up on the politics and history '
            'of the region and about mineral rights. Struck by the image of '
            'the train cemetery in Uyuni, a series of rusting British '
            'locomotives sitting amid the salt flats, he thought it was a '
            'great place to start a story: “an arresting, bright empty '
            'space”.\n'
            'Smith is married to an NHS doctor and some of their conversations '
            'about the mental and physical health of the nation made it into '
            'the play. Gradually, he says, these different ideas and images '
            'coalesced, connections formed: lithium, as well as being a '
            'component of batteries, is also a mood stabiliser. The play, says '
            'Smith, forces you to take a position where benevolent technocracy '
            'is the solution to the climate crisis; he doesn’t agree with that '
            'himself, but it’s intended as a provocation. “I don’t know if I '
            'have enough faith in people to change our behaviour in a way that '
            'is rationally best for the planet.” The play is also interested '
            'in ideas of language – it is full of instances of meaning being '
            'lost in translation – and in history, both cultural and personal. '
            'Fink has tried to detach himself from his past. “He sees it as '
            'somehow getting in the way of his grand messianic view.”\n'
            'As he was writing, Smith asked himself: “Does it need to be this '
            'big? Should I cut a strand? And I resisted it.” The Royal Court '
            'never told him to restrict the play for reasons of scale or cost. '
            '“That is a wonderful gift to be given as a writer.” It’s being '
            'directed by Hamish Pirie who has a rich visual approach – he put '
            'a ball-pit on stage for Tim Price’s Teh Internet is Serious '
            'Business and a flock of live goats in Goats by Syrian playwright '
            'Liwaa Yazji. While Smith is grateful to be back in the rehearsal '
            'room, he’s acutely aware that you can’t just pick up where you '
            'left off. The world has undergone a collective trauma and the '
            'pandemic is far from over. While theatres are now playing to full '
            'capacity audiences, he’s aware of the increasing case rate and '
            'remains cautious, perhaps more so than most. As well as being a '
            'doctor, his wife is also a cancer patient and they were shielding '
            'throughout lockdown.\n'
            'Smith studied English at the University of Edinburgh. His first '
            'major play, Harrogate – a two-hander about a complicated '
            'father-daughter relationship and sexual role play – premiered at '
            'the High Tide festival in Aldeburgh and transferred to the Royal '
            'Court. He has also written for Holby City and EastEnders, as well '
            'as five series of Radio 4’s Life Lines about an ambulance '
            'dispatch worker played by Sarah Ridgeway, who also starred in '
            'Harrogate. Smith spent some time at the South Western Ambulance '
            'Service Trust in Exeter, listening in on calls. He speaks with '
            'passion about the creative possibilities of radio drama. “It’s '
            'something which doesn’t receive a lot of press. I love the medium '
            'but it’s getting hammered. The cuts in radio drama have been '
            'massive.” Rare Earth Mettle is about power and apathy, he says. '
            'Fink asks people to save the world by allowing him to absorb all '
            'the risk. Which is nuts, says Smith, but “when you have that kind '
            'of ludicrous intellectual hypocrisy at the highest level, I don’t '
            'know how anyone can be trusted to take a rational line about '
            'anything”. Sometimes, he adds: “I question whether the things I '
            'write are too absurd, but then I remember the secretary of state '
            'for culture ate bollocks on television for money. Rome is '
            'definitely burning.” Rare Earth Mettle is at the Royal Court, '

            'are extremely concerned about 1.5C,” they said. “That’s why we '
            'are calling for a way to keep 1.5C as a viable option.” The High '
            'Ambition Coalition was formed in the run-up to Paris by the chief '
            'negotiator for the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum. Though the '
            'tiny Pacific island state, made up of 29 atolls, has a population '
            'of only 60,000, the charismatic De Brum had a major influence at '
            'climate Cops. The goal of holding temperature rises to 1.5C '
            'rather than 2C is much harder to achieve, as it requires '
            'emissions cuts of at least 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 '
            'levels. But science shows it is much safer – beyond 1.5C, many of '
            'the impacts of climate breakdown, such as melting ice sheets, '
            'become irreversible, and many small islands would face inundation '
            'from rising sea levels and storm surges. De Brum spent months '
            'taking soundings from developed and developing countries, and in '
            'the closing days, when it appeared that the 1.5C could be in '
            'danger, the coalition was announced. John Kerry, the US climate '
            'envoy, said earlier this year that the Paris goal of “pursuing '
            'efforts” to 1.5C was “based on hard work by the High Ambition '
            'Coalition and the small island developing states. They felt it '
            'that it was imperative – and thank heavens they did. Science has '
            'now caught up to that fact, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on '
            'Climate Change] and IEA [International Energy Agency] and others '
            'have been pretty clear, that this is what we need to try to '
            'achieve.” De Brum died in 2017. Stege is his niece.',

{'article': 'It took six years for David Beckham’s Inter Miami team to make it '
            'onto a football field. It’s going to take a while longer for '
            'success to follow. Under the guidance of head coach Phil Neville, '
            'the second-year expansion team is ending the season well adrift '
            'of the MLS playoffs. After leaving the England women’s team to '
            'join his old Manchester United teammate in Miami, Neville was '
            'unable to lift a goal-shy roster into the Eastern Conference’s '
            'top seven. Six straight losses – by a combined score of 16-1 – '
            'undid a promising mid-season revival that saw only one defeat in '
            '11. Neville was recently fined for claiming Miami were “being '
            'cheated” by MLS referees, but it was a conference-low 35 goals in '
            '33 games and a lack of collectivism that proved Miami’s undoing. '
            'In mid-October, Neville admitted his team would be “bottom of the '
            'league by a long way” but for 12 goals from Gonzalo Higuaín. '
            'Despite late-season signs of life – including a 5-1 win over '
            'Cincinnati – Miami were left needing a miracle. Saturday’s 3-1 '
            'defeat at home to New York City, at which Beckham was present, '
            'extinguished faint playoff hopes and left Miami 11th out of 14 '
            'teams in the Eastern Conference, with one game remaining. '
            'Neville’s position isn’t under threat, despite this '
            'underachievement. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t expect us to '
            'finish higher and I take responsibility for that. But I can’t '
            'wait for 17 January to attack next season as quick as possible,” '
            'he said on Friday. Neville speaks of the need to for the team to '
            'become younger. During a recent press conference, he told the '
            'Guardian: “I think this MLS is a young person’s league. Maybe '
            '10-15 years ago it was seen as a retirement league. Now some of '
            'the best young players are coming through the academies. We’re a '
            'club that wants to produce our own players and we’ve given debuts '
            'to some of our academy players.”\n'
            'With the coach’s emphasis on reducing the average age (Miami have '
            'the fifth-oldest squad in MLS) and the acknowledgment MLS isn’t '
            'pasture for aging Europeans, the 2021 signing of defenders Ryan '
            'Shawcross, 34, and Kieran Gibbs, 32, baffles. In truth, there are '
            'few signs the club is operating under a clear vision, on the '
            'commercial or playing side. In a damning report in The Athletic '
            'in August, a club source said: “We launched a brand, not a team.” '
            'On the field, Neville bemoans the absence of a roster “more '
            'interested in the team than themselves.” The '
            'expansion-team-finding-its-feet defence doesn’t wash these days. '
            'Nashville joined MLS alongside Miami, sit second in the east and '
            'will move to a 30,000-seater stadium next season. In 2018, '
            'Atlanta United won MLS Cup in their second season. Sporting '
            'director Chris Henderson, a January acquisition from Seattle '
            'Sounders, could provide a more coherent team-building strategy. '
            'The continuity offered by a second-year coaching team will '
            'benefit Miami if Neville finds his feet. Neville’s desire to '
            'field younger players is achievable but boosting the squad '
            'quality is more challenging. The club is hamstrung by $2,271,250 '
            'salary cap sanctions, spread over 2022 and 2023. Excluding the '
            'three designated player (DP) spots, each team can only spend '
            '$4.9m on player wages a season, leaving Miami down around 20%. '
            'MLS ruled 2020 salaries afforded to French World Cup winner '
            'Blaise Matuidi and Andres Reyes were worthy of designated player '
            'allocations; slots Miami filled elsewhere. An investigation also '
            'unearthed “underreporting of salary budget amounts” for three '
            'more players. The punishment for this “incorrect roster '
            'categorization” (aka cheating) was severe. Oddly, the DP rule was '
            'adopted in 2007 so LA Galaxy could pay the $6.5m salary of a '
            'certain David Beckham. It means Neville’s aspirations of blooding '
            '“two, three, or four” players from Miami’s reserve side, Fort '
            'Lauderdale CF, must be realised. Due to existing commitments, '
            'enlisting new DPs is trickier. The current trio of Higuaín, 33, '
            'Matuidi, 34, and the unfavoured Rodolfo Pizarro all have deals '
            'for next season. “It’s a difficult situation for everybody. The '
            'sanctions mean next year we’re going to have to be really, really '
            'good at building a roster,” Neville said. “Me, Chris Henderson '
            'and the ownership will sit down and think of the best way to '
            'build a roster to be competitive. “This club has to be '
            'competitive. There are no excuses, whether we put the youngest '
            'team, or the oldest team out there. Come the first game next '
            'season, the supporters, ownership, manager, players, and MLS will '
            'be expecting us to compete and win games of football. This club '
            'has to win trophies, that’s what I as a manager have to deliver.” '
            'Harnessing local talent was part of the club’s pitch. In 2018, '
            'Beckham promised to build a “state of the art” academy and now '
            'has U-12 through U-17 teams playing at the first-team’s training '
            'facility. Beckham is a regular at games and, by all accounts, '
            'gracious with his time with watching parents. It’s intertwined '
            'with the club’s efforts to join the fabric of the community, '
            'embracing the area’s Latin heritage. It started with the name – '
            'Inter Miami Club de Fútbol – and is reflected in the stands with '
            'a loud core of supporters dubbed “La Familia”. On humid Florida '
            'nights, it feels like a South American arena. Max Ramos of The '
            'Siege supporters group says: “We’re a fútbol club in an American '
            'sports league. The Supporters’ Section is extremely Latin and the '
            'majority of the fanbase is Hispanic. The club has done a really '
            'good job of allowing us to go with a South American atmosphere '
            'within an American framework. “Of course, there are things that '
            'you can’t do next to an airport in Fort Lauderdale, that you can '
            'at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires! I can’t launch a flare, for '
            'example. But the music, the lighting, it’s very Miami. “Could '
            'they do more, like having a stadium announcer, or more media in '
            'Spanish? Sure. But it’s still a work in progress.” Local '
            'enthusiasm is waning slightly. Attendances are down up to a '
            'quarter on the mid-season peak of 17,925. But this is south '
            'Florida. Historically, winning cures all. The excitement can be '
            'relit. “Everyone’s pissed right now, but it can all change in a '
            'year,” Ramos adds. Efforts to intertwine team and community – '
            'like September’s “Celebra Tu Patria” Hispanic Heritage Night – '
            'remain difficult while Inter play in another city, an hour’s '
            'drive away. The temporary stadium is in Fort Lauderdale, a much '
            'different cultural vibe. Word on the planned 25,000-seater '
            'stadium development in Freedom Park Miami is scant. “The stadium '
            'in Fort Lauderdale is lovely,” Ramos adds. “They’ve done a '
            'brilliant job of making it feel like a proper football stadium. '
            'If it was built in Miami instead of Fort Lauderdale, no-one would '
            'care. The problem is the name says ‘Miami’.” Neville, for one, '
            'acknowledges little is ideal for the club’s patient fans right '
            'now. “The supporters have suffered and suffered badly,” he said '
            'on Friday. “We’ve got great plans for this football club, and I '
            'feel this season we’ve put some of the bricks in the foundations '
            'to be successful in the years to come. It was never going to be a '
            'quick, overnight turnaround; it never is in football.” Neville '
            'has faced questions about the club’s ambitions multiple times a '
            'week lately, but this is still “David Beckham’s Inter Miami”. '
            'Neville says Beckham is “frustrated” and “wants better”, but fans '
            'may appreciate occasionally hearing from the man who appointed '
            'the manager. Neville’s first season in club management has been '
            'deeply disappointing. He only shot par with England women; now he '
            'must prove his Miami appointment wasn’t just jobs for the boys.',

{'article': 'Last week in Sudan, two years disappeared in a flash. Two years '
            'of working to bring Sudan in from the cold after almost three '
            'decades of isolation. Two years of trying to establish a civilian '
            'government. Two years of mourning those who had died in Sudan’s '
            'revolution to oust Omar al-Bashir. And two years of tentative '
            'hope that perhaps these deaths had not been in vain. In the end, '
            'all that mattered was that it was two years during which the '
            'military grew tired of partnering with civilians in a '
            'transitional power-sharing agreement. Last week, the army seized '
            'power in a coup that erased everything the Sudanese people had '
            'gained since Bashir’s military government was toppled in 2019. '
            'That revolution had reignited hope for democratic rule, not only '
            'in Sudan, but across the Arab world. In hindsight, its '
            'short-lived nature seems inevitable. Sudan’s uprising may have '
            'removed Bashir, but behind him sat a military and security state '
            'with deep roots and complex economic interests. When it became '
            'clear that the Sudanese people were not going to tolerate another '
            'military figurehead as a replacement for Bashir, an agreement '
            'with civilian parties resulted in a transitional power-sharing '
            'arrangement that should have paved the way for elections.\n'
            'One could argue that it was naive to expect the military and its '
            'associated allies to merely hand over power and withdraw to the '
            'barracks. But it also seemed unfathomable that they would make '
            'such a brash, regressive move as they have. The country’s '
            'newfound stability is still in its infancy. The military now '
            'faces international condemnation and diplomatic crises. The coup '
            'has severed attempts to reintegrate Sudan into the international '
            'community. Debt relief has been suspended, leaving the economy on '
            'its knees. The US cancelled 700 million dollars worth of aid only '
            '24 hours after the coup. Yet these calculations do not concern '
            'militaries who are bent on extraction in a country that does not '
            'need to thrive for its overlords to prosper. An alliance between '
            'a large army of mercenaries, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF, the '
            'formalised and uniformed version of the Janjaweed that terrorised '
            'the Darfur region), the army, and remnants of business interests '
            'from the Bashir regime now has the country in a tight grip. They '
            'will run Sudan as the host body for a partnership of parasites. '
            'Without facing the checks of transparency or accountability, '
            'Sudan’s new ruling club will be able to divide the country’s '
            'infrastructure, seizing raw materials such as gold, and selling '
            'them to regional allies. They will have the firepower to suppress '
            'rebellions in the country’s marginalised regions. By doing dirty, '
            'lucrative deals with Gulf allies, they will be able to alienate '
            'whomever they please in the west. RSF forces have already sold '
            'Sudanese soldiers – some of them children – to the UAE and Saudi '
            'Arabia to provide support for their wars in Yemen. Flogging '
            'Sudan’s resources and people to the highest bidder is too '
            'lucrative a business to give up for a few hundred million dollars '
            'of western aid. In that sense, Sudan’s revolution, like all '
            'revolutions, was not only against one regime, but many. It took '
            'aim at the corrupt legacies and arrangements that were manifested '
            'in a single dictator – Bashir – who was vested with power by his '
            'large network of enablers. At every stage of the uprising since '
            '2018, the Sudanese people have discovered another despot behind '
            'the despot. Behind Bashir stood a phalanx of generals who had '
            'come to power when many of the protesters on the streets had not '
            'even been born. Behind the generals was the mercenary army, and '
            'behind the mercenaries towered the allies of the '
            'counterrevolution, Sudan’s allies in the Middle East and north '
            'Africa: Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt, which wanted to ensure '
            'democratic civilian rule never became a reality on their '
            'doorstep. Condemnation from the US and censure by the UN merely '
            'bounces off the iron realpolitik that sustains Sudan’s coup.\n'
            'In a way, it is a miracle that the Sudanese revolution succeeded '
            'at all, that it lasted a whole two years before the army moved '
            'once again. It is a testament to the number and indefatigability '
            'of the protesters, who kept spilling on to the streets in 2019. '
            'They not only removed Bashir, but dictated the shape of the '
            'transitional government that followed him. Millions of Sudanese '
            'people stared down the barrel of what seemed like certain '
            'failure, and persevered. Last week they did so again, taking to '
            'the streets in their millions to reject the coup and demand the '
            'return of the civilian government, and the release of many of its '
            'members, including the prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, who are in '
            'detention or house arrest. The Sudanese waited 30 years for a '
            'revolution, only for three to come at once. Last week, protesters '
            'were shot and beaten once again, and the dead and wounded fell on '
            'the streets of Sudan’s cities. Once again, an anxious standoff is '
            'taking place between Sudan’s people and an army and alliance of '
            'security forces that has only two choices: bend to the will of '
            'the Sudanese, or massacre them. The soldiers and military men '
            'think there might be a third option – to bide their time and hope '
            'that the protests run out of steam as the new military government '
            'settles in. That seems unlikely. But even if the coup prevails, '
            'it will be an uneasy win, enfeebled by constant policing and '
            'suppression of dissent. Civic resistance to the coup might appear '
            'frail when compared to the might of the generals and their '
            'backers, but the military is up against a people who are '
            'determined never again to be ruled by force. Their determination '
            'seems as limitless as the army’s appetite for power. Nesrine '

{'article': 'In one of his most celebrated paintings, O the Roast Beef of Old '
            'England, William Hogarth appears as himself, sketching the '
            'fortifications at Calais at the very moment of being mistakenly '
            'arrested as a spy in 1748. It is not what you would call a subtle '
            'scene. The raggedy French soldiers are on their last legs, barely '
            'sustained by watery soup, while a gaggle of fishwives resemble '
            'the flounder they are selling from their tatty basket. There’s a '
            'fat, greedy friar trying to get his hands on a sumptuous joint of '
            'beef which has just been unloaded and is on its way to one of the '
            'many English restaurants that thrive in Calais (only 200 years '
            'earlier the town had belonged to Britain). Spying, by '
            'implication, is not something that Britons resort to, although '
            'the figure of Hogarth busily sketching to one side is a warning '
            'not to dismiss John Bull as dense. The “Old England” Hogarth '
            'conjures up here is affluent, abundant and free. The French, '
            'meanwhile, are reduced to a series of humiliating stereotypes: '
            'silly, salacious and in thrall to the absolutist Roman Catholic '
            'church (you can just make out some gorgeously attired priests and '
            'abasing peasants in the background).\n'
            'It is easy to see why Hogarth is so often positioned as the '
            'founding father of a particular strand of art which is '
            'essentially British: figurative, storytelling and not afraid to '
            'poke fun at itself. His most famous social satires including A '
            'Rake’s Progress and Marriage A-la-Mode are often read as a cross '
            'between a Shakespearean comedy and a Carry On film, with more '
            'disguises, reversals of fortune, libidinous ladies and drunken '
            'lads than you can shake a bottle of gin at. However, Tate '
            'Britain’s new exhibition Hogarth and Europe sets out to show that '
            'the artist was far from anyone’s idea of a “little Englander”. '
            'Rather, he saw himself, and was in turn seen, as a keen citizen '
            'of a rapidly globalising marketplace. Not only did Hogarth travel '
            'in Europe, but scores of Italian and French painters came to work '
            'in his native London, setting up powerful networks of '
            'cross-pollination, mutual support and occasional thievery. Even '
            'those artists who were happiest staying home were now able to '
            'keep a careful eye on the competition. Engraving, a technology '
            'that Hogarth embraced, allowed accurate copies of masterworks to '
            'circulate far and wide, creating a new virtual community of art '
            'workers.\n'
            'In this new context, O the Roast Beef of Old England starts to '
            'read quite differently. In the luscious still-life details – '
            'especially that beautiful marbled beef – Hogarth’s work owes a '
            'clear debt to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, the French '
            'Academician whose work he had recently seen in Paris and whose '
            'luscious still lifes he knew so well. Then there’s the way that '
            'Hogarth uses the recognisable topography of the gate of Calais as '
            'a framing device, which places his painting firmly in the '
            'emerging genre of city views, currently being brought to '
            'perfection by Canaletto who was living and working in London. '
            'Recent scholarship, meanwhile, has revealed that Hogarth’s savage '
            'anti-Catholic imagery was borrowed from his many Huguenot '
            'friends, French Protestant refugees who had fled religious '
            'persecution to London. The figure of the fat, greedy friar was '
            'modelled by Hogarth’s old friend and master engraver John Pine, a '
            'man believed to be of African descent, one of the 3% of London’s '
            'population that was black at the time. Finally, the reason '
            'Hogarth’s Old England picture achieved such saturation was thanks '
            'to the way it was reproduced on punchbowls and vases painted in '
            'China for the English market. By setting Hogarth’s work alongside '
            'his European contemporaries Chardin, Pietro Longhi, Cornelis '
            'Troost (sometimes called “the Dutch Hogarth”), Giuseppe Crespi '
            'and Nicolas Lancret, the Tate curators are hoping for unexpected '
            'connections, echoes and even dust-ups. A case in point: when the '
            'Venetian painter Jacopo Amigoni won the job of decorating the '
            'stairs in the new buildings for St Bartholomew’s hospital in '
            'London in 1730s, Hogarth bustled in and insisted on doing the job '
            'without payment. There was a limit to how friendly one could be '
            'expected to be towards the competition. What bound these men '
            'together, and occasionally led to them falling out, was their '
            'shared understanding of what it meant to be an artist in this '
            'modern world. “Hogarth and his contemporaries were the first '
            'creative freelancers,” explains co-curator Martin Myrone. '
            '“Artists were no longer bound to royal or aristocratic patronage, '
            'but were free to set up on their own.” (The same went for '
            'musicians such as the Mozart family who toured Britain under '
            'their own steam, rather than at the behest of king or empress). '
            'Gradually new spaces opened up for independent artists and their '
            'studios. In London it was Long Acre, in Paris the Rue St-Jacques. '
            'Commercial neighbourhoods now took the place of royal courts and '
            'elite academies in the role of building relations between '
            'clients, suppliers and the artists themselves.\n'
            'No one was better poised to take advantage of these shifts than '
            'Hogarth, who was born in London in 1697. His hopeless father '
            'aspired to be a man of letters but ended up imprisoned for debt '
            'after the failure of a coffee shop in which the customers were '
            'required to speak Latin. Young William was initially apprenticed '
            'to a silver-plate engraver but soon broke from his master – '
            'something that would have been professional suicide only 50 years '
            'earlier – to set up as an independent copperplate engraver '
            'producing book illustrations, tickets and trade cards. Hogarth’s '
            'trajectory as a self-published artist carved out new routes to '
            'financial success and creative independence. What’s more, his '
            'written reflections on the art world combined with his '
            'determination to ensure artists’ copyright (successfully made law '
            'in 1735), showed a keen sense of how creative workers needed to '
            'protect themselves from commercial exploitation and risk. All '
            'this comes across in his famous self-portrait The Painter and His '
            'Pug. X-rays have revealed that Hogarth started off painting '
            'himself as an artist in the grand manner, with a wig and formal '
            'coat with gold buttons. Around 1745, possibly following a trip to '
            'Paris, he dramatically changed direction and showed himself as a '
            'working professional in an informal jacket and cap. He even '
            'includes his scar. The way he emphasises the similarities between '
            'his own smudgy, snub-nosed face and that of his pug puts one in '
            'mind of Lucian Freud’s paintings in which human and animal bodies '
            'are placed on a continuum. And the fact that Hogarth chooses to '
            'be painted with a pug – a Dutch breed that originated from China '
            '– cuts across any sense of him as a bluff patriot who would only '
            'pose with a British bulldog. Hogarth brought this same enlarged '
            'sense of selfhood to his portraits of women. Until now it was '
            'only princesses and empresses who were painted, their bodies used '
            'as fleshy Christmas trees on which to dangle the symbols of their '
            'husbands’ wealth. But Hogarth does something quite different, '
            'intent on searching for what makes a woman her own person. His '
            'most famous painting is of Miss Mary Edwards, an heiress who '
            'inherited about £8m in today’s money, at the age of 23. She '
            'married a nobleman called Lord Anne Hamilton (his Christian name '
            'makes the whole thing even more intriguing) who agreed to take '
            'her name. But when Lord Anne started running through Mary’s '
            'fortune she insisted on a separation and managed to prove that '
            'her marriage was invalid, despite making her son illegitimate in '
            'the process. In this portrait, not seen in Britain for a 100 '
            'years, Hogarth shows Mary surrounded with the symbols of a '
            'genderless independence: a gun dog, a celestial globe, portrait '
            'busts of Alfred the Great and papers which include a proclamation '
            'of individual rights. She gazes fearlessly at the viewer, a new '
            'woman for a new world.\n'
            'That same marked sense of individuality is apparent when Hogarth '
            'paints his sisters. Subjectivity was no longer the sole preserve '
            'of the rich and the aristocratic but could be embodied by '
            'middle-class women too. His pictures of Mary and Anne are not '
            'glamour portraits but accurate likenesses, instantly recognisable '
            'as his siblings by their snub noses and soft jaws. The women have '
            'the tough wary faces that come from being brought up with a '
            'spendthrift father. They know what it is to go out to work – '
            'together they run a children’s clothing shop – and they know how '
            'much money is enough. Equally striking are Hogarth’s portraits of '
            'his servants whom he draws as individuals, rather than “types”. '
            'The Tate curators suggest that Hogarth may well have been '
            'inspired by images in Jean-Antoine Watteau’s sketchbook, in which '
            'the French artist, normally associated with whimsical fêtes '
            'galantes, practises drawing people of African descent. While the '
            'Tate show is eye-opening in the way it repositions Hogarth the '
            'bluff patriot as a knowing European, it would be quite wrong, '
            'Myrone says, to call him a revolutionary. The progressive left '
            'has always had much invested in Hogarth as a class warrior and '
            'fearless critic of developing capitalism. Narratives including A '
            'Harlot’s Progress and Marriage A-la-Mode offer a fierce critique '
            'of men and women debased by their new appetites for gin and sex, '
            'but above all for the piles of stuff – silk shawls, cones of '
            'sugar, showy geegaws – that were pouring into Britain as a result '
            'of its developing empire. But to suggest Hogarth hated capitalism '
            'would be as misleading as insisting on him as a proto-Brexiteer. '
            'His first loyalty remained always to himself. In 1757 he was '
            'delighted to take over the role of Serjeant Painter to the king '
            'from his brother-in-law, much as his closest European ally '
            'Chardin happily accepted a state pension. The Hogarth who emerges '
            'from this exhibition is neither saint nor sinner, left or right, '
            'but a modern artist who knew at any given moment where his best '
            'interests lay in a rapidly changing world. • Hogarth and Europe '
            'is at Tate Britain, Millbank, London SW1, from 3 November to 20 '

{'article': 'In Seattle, some police detectives stepped into patrol cars over '
            'the last month for the first time in more than a decade, '
            'according to Sgt Randy Huserik, who has been with the department '
            'for 28 years. The department has been short-staffed since 18 '
            'October, when the city began enforcing a mandate requiring '
            'officers to get vaccinated against Covid-19. But while the '
            'Seattle police union warned that the mandate would lead to “an '
            'alarming escalation in crime” and “an untenable public safety '
            'crisis”, Huserik said the department’s staffing strategy had '
            'allowed it to continue to properly respond to 911 calls. “We '
            'haven’t seen a significant need for detectives to be donning '
            'their uniforms and heading out and handling 911 calls,” Huserik '
            'said. “It’s only been a few [people] here and there.” Cities '
            'around the US have implemented similar mandates – and faced the '
            'same sort of backlash from police unions who have predicted chaos '
            '– but the warnings that the mandates would deplete police '
            'departments and make cities more dangerous have not yet proven '
            'true, according to policing and public health experts. Chuck '
            'Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research '
            'Forum, which advises police departments across the country, '
            'described the warnings from police unions as “bravado”. “This '
            'isn’t asking cops to work extra hours without getting '
            'compensated,” said Wexler. “This is about a public health '
            'emergency, and this isn’t about taking away rights. This is about '
            'protecting cops from dying” from Covid, which has killed almost '
            '500 officers in the United States over the last two years, about '
            'five times the number who died from gunfire, according to the '
            'non-profit Officer Down Memorial Page.\n'
            'On Monday, New York began enforcing its vaccinate mandate for '
            'city employees, which meant about 9,000 people who refused to get '
            'the vaccine were placed on unpaid leave, representing about 6% of '
            'the city workforce, according to NPR. Mayor Bill de Blasio said '
            'on Monday that 91% of city employees had been vaccinated, the New '
            'York Times reported. That included the New York police '
            'department, the largest in the country, in which 85% of officers '
            'have been vaccinated, up from 70% just a couple of weeks ago. '
            'Other cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, have seen the '
            'same increase in vaccinations before mandate deadlines, as '
            'workers decide they would rather get the shot than lose their '
            'jobs or be placed on unpaid leave. In Seattle, 92% of the police '
            'department is fully vaccinated, according to the city. Twenty-two '
            'employees are partially vaccinated, and 100 others have requested '
            'an exemption. To combat the staffing shortfall, Seattle’s mayor, '
            'Jenny Durkan, announced last week that the city would begin '
            'offering a $25,000 hiring bonus to experienced officers or 911 '
            'dispatchers. “We are encouraged by the mayor’s support because we '
            'have been pursuing hiring incentives,” Huserik said. But Mike '
            'Solan, president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, condemned '
            'Durkan’s announcement, telling Fox News that she had already '
            'betrayed police officers by implementing the vaccine mandate and '
            'not supporting them during protests after George Floyd was killed '
            'in 2020. Despite the fierce battles over vaccine mandates, public '
            'health experts say they are effective. “As the deadline for the '
            'mandate gets closer, even people who said initially they are not '
            'going to get the vaccine, they begin to move and do get '
            'vaccinated,” said Sandra C Quinn, a professor of family science '
            'at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who has '
            'studied the role of communication in vaccine acceptance. Adam '
            'Galinsky, a social psychologist and expert in leadership and '
            'ethics at Columbia University, said the last-minute decisions to '
            'get vaccinated could be attributed to people’s tendency to avoid '
            'actions they might later regret. With a mandate, the decision is '
            'somewhat taken out of their hands. “Mandates work – especially '
            'mandates around public health,” Galinsky said. “Even when people '
            'whine … and say they are going to quit, most people don’t.” '
            'Despite the uptick due to the mandates, some public health '
            'experts worry about the long-term consequences of the '
            'requirements on healthcare and society, including potentially '
            'greater opposition to other vaccines, said Katrin Schmelz, a '
            'behavioral economist and psychologist at the University of '
            'Konstanz. “Vaccination mandates will increase vaccination rates '
            'and on the other side of the scale, it could increase hostility '
            'towards the government and aggression and affect compliance with '
            'other Covid measures,” said Schmelz, who lives in Germany, which '
            'does not mandate Covid vaccines. “It’s not just: we enforce [the '
            'mandate] and are on the safe side, and all the problems are '
            'solved.”',

            'anyone could have predicted.\n'
            'In the day-to-day business Nuno never won over the players. There '
            'were no personal clashes as such. It was more that his way of '
            'dealing with things did not work with this group; his character '
            'did not fit. He never got into the heart of this squad. It is '
            'possible that Spurs’ botched attempts at hiring so many other '
            'managers before Nuno played into this. The fact that he was given '
            'a two-year contract was also a sign that Tottenham did not quite '
            'believe in him – so why should the players?\n'
            'Nuno was acutely aware of this and it did not take long before '
            'things came to a head. The end of the transfer window was a huge '
            'let-down for the former Wolves manager, who had wanted a '
            'midfielder and a back-up forward to support Harry Kane. The fact '
            'that neither arrived proved to Nuno what he knew deep down: that '
            'he was a stopgap. At the same time the club grew more and more '
            'frustrated with his tactics and some of his selections. The game '
            'against Arsenal towards the end of September was a disaster, '
            'Spurs looking rudderless as they fell to a 3-1 defeat. Nuno was '
            'endearingly honest afterwards. “The performance was not good,” he '
            'said. “The gameplan was not good. I take responsibility because '
            'the decisions were not right.” One such defeat was bad enough but '
            'when a second arrived against Manchester United on Saturday – a '
            'team that had just lost heavily to Liverpool and were low on '
            'confidence – it was too much for the chairman, Daniel Levy, and '
            'managing director of football, Fabio Paratici.\n'
            'They already knew in their hearts that Nuno was not the long-term '
            'solution but had planned to give him more time to turn things '
            'round. They knew that he had not inherited an easy situation with '
            'Kane wanting to leave and below par at the end of the previous '
            'season. But the nature of the performance against United prompted '
            'them to meet on the Sunday to discuss the situation. There was '
            'anger over the display and the attitude of some players but also '
            'over some of Nuno’s tactical decisions, such as replacing Lucas '
            'Moura with Steven Bergwijn in the 54th minute. The meeting lasted '
            'more than five hours and it was decided that Nuno and his '
            'coaching team had to go. One reason was that Paratici, soon after '
            'the game, had made contact with Antonio Conte, the man they '
            'wanted to replace Nuno. It had been felt that convincing Conte to '
            'take the Spurs job would be akin to mission impossible, '
            'especially as he had turned them down in the summer. But Paratici '
            'had one main advantage – he had worked with Conte before.\n'
            'They were at Juventus from 2011 to 2014 with excellent results, '
            'winning the league every season and having a shared approach to '
            'football and recruitment. Conte had previously been considering '
            'only the Manchester United job in the event that Ole Gunnar '
            'Solskjær was sacked but phone calls to Conte and his advisers on '
            'Saturday night changed that. The talks continued throughout '
            'Sunday, Paratici trying to convince the former Chelsea manager '
            'that the Spurs project was worth buying into: the same project he '
            'had turned down in June. This time they offered him more '
            'decision-making power when it comes to signings in January and '
            'next summer and, most importantly, that this Tottenham will be '
            'made by Antonio Conte – and no one else.',

{'article': 'US employers are recruiting teenaged workers to solve their '
            'difficulties in hiring and retaining workers, and some '
            'Republicans and industry groups are pushing for looser child '
            'labor laws to allow those industries to put teens to work for '
            'longer hours. Businesses around the United States that have '
            'advertised hiring 14- and 15-year-olds through the pandemic’s '
            '“labor shortage” include several restaurants in Pennsylvania, a '
            'Pumpkin Patch in Liberty, Missouri, a Burger King in Ohio, and a '
            'McDonald’s in Oregon. Employers such as Chipotle have expanded '
            'recruiting efforts this year to target younger workers. Other '
            'restaurants and employers such as amusement parks and seasonal '
            'businesses around the US have touted their reliance on teenage '
            'workers under 18 as a labor shortage solution. A restaurant in '
            'Arkansas, noting it had struggled to hire and retain workers, '
            'recently offered to pay its teen workers for one hour to do '
            'homework before their shift. Teenage employment in the US surged '
            'to more than 32% in summer 2021, the highest level since 2008, '
            'and for the first time in history the unemployment rate for 16- '
            'to 19-year-olds fell below the rate for 20- to 24-year-olds. In a '
            'recent op-ed for a local Pennsylvania newspaper, Darcy Leight, a '
            'junior in high school, argued the claims of labor shortages and '
            'staffing issues in the food service, recreation and tourism '
            'industry had driven teenagers to work more and longer hours past '
            'summer employment periods. “A job I intended to work strictly '
            'during the summer has somehow found its way into my fall schedule '
            'and has become almost equivalent to academics on my priority '
            'list. And I don’t even know how it happened,” she wrote. “The '
            'coupling of a job anywhere from five to 35 hours a week along '
            'with being a student is extremely stressful.” The labor shortage '
            'concerns have galvanized an effort by some elected officials – '
            'mostly Republicans – to scale back some child labor regulations. '
            'Three Republicans and one Democrat in the Ohio state senate have '
            'recently introduced a bill to expand the hours minors under the '
            'age of 16 are permitted to work in the state, from 7pm to 9pm '
            'during the school year with a parent or guardian’s permission. In '
            'Wisconsin, Republican state senators recently approved a bill, '
            'SB332, and sent it to the Wisconsin state assembly. The bill '
            'would expand permissible work hours for minors under the age of '
            '16. Supporters of the bill, which include Republican legislators, '
            'the Wisconsin Restaurant Association and other industry groups, '
            'have argued the bill could help small businesses that are '
            'experiencing hiring and staff retention issues amid some '
            'industries experiencing labor shortages throughout 2021. Under '
            'current law, minors are permitted to work from 7am to 7pm from '
            'labor day to 31 May and 7am to 9pm from 1 June to labor day. The '
            'bill would expand those times and dates from 6am to 9.30pm on a '
            'day preceding a school day and 6am to 11pm on a day preceding a '
            'non-school day, and expand weekly hours from three hours during a '
            'school week to 18 hours. Wisconsin Republicans have successfully '
            'passed several bills in the last decade to weaken child labor '
            'laws, including in 2011 eliminating limits on the number of hours '
            'and days minors, ages 16 and 17, could work, eliminating work '
            'permits for 16 and 17-year-olds, and replacing all uses of the '
            'term “child labor” in state employment statutes with the term '
            '“employment of minors” in 2017.\n'
            '“The passage of this bill would be a slippery slope for '
            'eliminating child labor practices in Wisconsin and in the United '
            'States in general,” said Stephanie Bloomingdale, president of the '
            'Wisconsin AFL-CIO, which opposes SB332. “Young teenagers need to '
            'have good work experiences that help them to learn work ethics '
            'and valuable skills, but at the same time, recognizing they also '
            'are kids that need time to study, to sleep and to prepare their '
            'minds for their future.” Reports of labor shortages have received '
            'significant coverage throughout 2021, with employers and industry '
            'groups often blaming unemployment benefits for difficulties in '
            'finding enough workers, though ending unemployment benefits did '
            'not result in a mass influx of Americans returning to work. '
            'Several solutions that employers have turned to amid labor '
            'shortage concerns through 2021 include prison labor, recently '
            'released prisoners and immigrant visa programs. Labor groups and '
            'workers have characterized the labor issues as a result of low '
            'wages, Covid-19 safety concerns, rampant poor working conditions '
            'and a lack of childcare and paid sick leave throughout the US. '
            '“The notion that we would be solving some economic turmoil by '
            'allowing the expansion of child labor hours, is at best, '
            'ridiculous, and at worst, very detrimental to young people,” said '
            'Debra Cronmiller, executive director of the League of Women '
            'Voters of Wisconsin. Scientific research has shown working long '
            'hours while attending high school can have negative academic and '
            'behavioral impacts on teenagers. Dr Kathryn C Monahan, a '
            'psychologist who researched the impact of work on adolescents '
            'while at the University of Washington, explained much of the '
            'research on adolescent employment has focused on formal types of '
            'employment that generally occurs at age 16 and above. “What this '
            'bill does, I think, is it opens up and it encourages young teens '
            'to enter into that workforce,” said Monahan. She noted a lack of '
            'scientific research on how work affects teens this young, and '
            'what impact earning income at such a young age may have on other '
            'negative behaviors, such as dropping out of high school and '
            'substance abuse. “The second thing that concerns me about this is '
            'the sleep issue,” Monahan added. “ I can imagine the kid getting '
            'home later on a school night … because that’s when that child '
            'uses that time for homework, for catching up with friends, and so '
            'you’re going to get an even further delay out in terms of sleep, '
            'while school is going to stay constant in terms of those really '
            'early wake up times.”',

{'article': 'Chinese authorities have been accused of “continuously stymying” '
            'attempts by foreign media to cover the Winter Olympics, by '
            'denying or ignoring requests for access and following, harassing '
            'and abusing journalists. In a scathing statement on Tuesday, the '
            'Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which acts on behalf of '
            'foreign media in China, called for transparency and clarity from '
            'China’s national Olympic organising committee. The club also '
            'accused the committee of failing to uphold the International '
            'Olympic Committee’s charter requiring it to ensure the fullest '
            'media coverage possible for the widest global audience. The Games '
            'are due to take place in Beijing in February. “Our members’ '
            'repeated inquiries towards [Beijing Organising Committee for the '
            'Olympic Games] on how international media can report on the Games '
            'have been met with conflicting answers or neglected completely,” '
            'the FCCC said. “FCCC members report spending weeks trying to '
            'obtain contact details for BOCOG media facilitators, only to '
            'receive dismissive or inaccurate information from them.” The FCCC '
            'said in the past year foreign journalists had been largely unable '
            'to access press conferences or events that were open to domestic '
            'media, including the arrival of the Olympic flame. It said many '
            'press dates were not publicised, or announced with only a few '
            'hours’ notice. “Foreign journalists who attempt to register for '
            'events are denied because BOCOG limits attendance to only their '
            'chosen media outlets, claim the event is full, or because they '
            'require participants to submit Covid test results within an '
            'impossible timeframe of only a few hours.” The FCCC provided '
            'several testimonies, including from a US journalist who said they '
            'were stopped and questioned by police after they tried to take '
            'photos with their phone of a venue, from a public road. Another '
            'broadcaster said it was called by an organiser of an Olympic '
            'venue tour and shouted at over a report that mentioned human '
            'rights boycotts. “We haven’t been given access since,” the '
            'broadcaster said. A European newspaper reporter who attempted to '
            'visit venues after BOCOG failed to grant access was stopped at '
            'the entrance to winter sports slopes in Chongli and Yanqing. '
            '“This lack of access means Chinese state media claims about the '
            'environmental sustainability of venues are impossible to verify,” '
            'the reporter said. The FCCC said the conditions for visiting '
            'accredited foreign journalists were also unclear, including '
            'whether they would be allowed to travel within and outside '
            'Beijing, and what quarantine measures were required of them. '
            'China is committed to a zero-Covid strategy and has enacted a '
            '“closed loop” management system for the Games, within which all '
            'participants and employees can only move between Games-related '
            'venues for training, competitions and work on a dedicated '
            'transport system. China’s relationship with international media '
            'has plummeted in recent years. Many in-country positions – '
            'including for major outlets such as the New York Times, '
            'Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, and all Australian '
            'outlets – remain empty after Beijing expelled or forced out '
            'dozens of reporters in 2020. It has since processed very few visa '
            'applications for journalists outside China hoping to go in, and '
            'dozens remain outstanding, leaving outlets with inadequate teams '
            'to cover the event. The FCC called on the BOCOG to provide '
            'transparency and clarity for international media, process '
            'outstanding visas, improve access and permission to press events '
            'and venues, and to appoint dedicated media communications '
            'officers who provide real assistance. “With less than three '
            'months remaining before the start of Beijing 2022, there is still '
            'tremendous uncertainty over how and if foreign correspondents '
            'will be able to cover the Games,” the FCCC said. The BOCOG has '

{'article': 'The Melbourne Cup’s reputation may be a little scratched but '
            'plenty of Australians still like to give it a trot. Attendances '
            'at meetings have been dwindling and fewer Australians are '
            'gambling on horse races – but those still having a punt are '
            'spending more. The Australian Hotels Association, meanwhile, has '
            'reported that pubs and restaurants are doing a roaring trade. A '
            'major report released by Gambling Research Australia in October '
            'found 16.8% of Australians gambled on horse races in the past '
            'year, down from 22.4% a decade before. But turnover keeps '
            'increasing, from $22.9bn in 2010-11 to $26.9bn in 2018-19 '
            '(adjusted for inflation). CQUniversity senior postdoctoral fellow '
            'in the experimental gambling research laboratory, and co-author '
            'of the report, Dr Alex Russell, says the apparent discrepancy is '
            'due to people turning off gambling, but those left behind being '
            'the heavy gamblers.\n'
            '“The people who are still betting are betting a tonne,” Russell '
            'said. “A lot of that is driven by more and more online gambling – '
            'it doubled in the past decade.” Russell said people have realised '
            'that gambling is not just a harmless recreational activity but '
            'something with damaging effects on people and animals. “We’re '
            'just seeing more and more people saying ‘I bloody hate gambling’, '
            'or ‘I’m sick of all the ads’,” he said. “The other thing about '
            'the Melbourne Cup and horse racing is it comes with the animal '
            'cruelty issue.” There have been seven horse deaths in the past '
            'six years at the big race, prompting Racing Victoria to introduce '
            'new safety measures. Animal rights protesters targeted it again '
            'this year, joined – inexplicably – by anti-lockdown activists. In '
            'an article in The Conversation, Russell pointed to an analysis of '
            'Melbourne Cup tweets last year that had #nuptothecup, '
            '#horseracingkills and #animalcruelty in the top 10. Attendances '
            'at the Cup were steadily declining before Covid changed '
            'everything. From a high of 122,736 (when Makybe Diva won in '
            '2003), the numbers hovered at just over 100,000 in the early '
            '2010s before sinking to 83,471 in 2018 then 81,408 in 2019. Covid '
            'meant there were no spectators last year and a cap of 10,000 '
            'people this year. Television audiences have also been declining, '
            'the Nine papers reported last year, although Channel 10 said '
            'people were live-streaming the event instead. Gerard Daffy from '
            'online sports betting site TAB said the cup might have “lost a '
            'bit of its gloss”, blaming an increasing number of international '
            'entries. But, thanks to the pandemic, Australians are dominating '
            'again. He said Incentivise (the pre-race favourite who came '
            'second behind Verry Elleegant) was a “headline act … a horse from '
            'Queensland that’s come from obscurity”. “The Melbourne Cup’s the '
            'Melbourne Cup,” Daffy said. “It’s the race that stops the nation, '
            'it truly does, and it always will.”\n'
            'The Australian Hotels Association chief executive officer, '
            'Stephen Ferguson, said while race-day crowds were on “an '
            'inchingly slow decline”, pubs and restaurants had held their '
            'ground. That was true this year, bearing in mind capacity '
            'restrictions, he said. “The Melbourne Cup is the starting gun for '
            'the run into Christmas,” he said. “It always is. It’s one of the '
            'biggest days of the year. It’s a festive day, full of bookings. '
            'People are social animals, they’re looking to get out there and '
            'connect. Who wants to get on a train to Flemington when you can '

{'article': 'Scott Morrison has been accused of putting his personal political '
            'interests ahead of healing Australia’s diplomatic rift with '
            'France, after the leaking of a text message from Emmanuel Macron '
            'to the prime minister. The release of a text received two days '
            'before the Aukus announcement – when the French president asked '
            'Morrison whether to expect good or bad news on the submarine '
            'project – was “highly unconventional behaviour between state '
            'leaders”, a leading foreign affairs analyst said. The Morrison '
            'government also pushed back at the US government on Tuesday, with '
            'the defence minister, Peter Dutton, saying Australia’s key '
            'security ally was “kept informed of our every move” in a '
            '“no-surprises strategy” in the lead up to the deal between the '
            'two countries and the UK.\n'
            'The Australian newspaper on Tuesday reported details of a 15-page '
            'confidential agreed communications timeline that the article said '
            'undermined claims by the US president, Joe Biden, that he did not '
            'know Australia had not informed France earlier about the '
            'cancellation of the French submarine contract. The extraordinary '
            'rift between Australia and France flows from Macron’s accusation '
            'that Morrison lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to '
            'acquire nuclear-propelled submarines. Morrison rejected the claim '
            'and said he was “not going to cop sledging of Australia”. '
            'Sydney’s Daily Telegraph and the Australian Financial Review '
            'reported Macron had texted Morrison two days before the Aukus '
            'announcement in mid-September to say: “Should I expect good or '
            'bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?”\n'
            'The leaked message – shared to reinforce Australia’s position '
            'that France wasn’t blindsided about the cancellation of the '
            'A$90bn submarine deal – also appeared to confirm Macron did not '
            'know which way Australia would go shortly before Aukus was '
            'unveiled. It was also reported Macron told Morrison in June, “I '
            'don’t like losing,” after the Australian prime minister raised '
            'concern in Paris about whether the 12 planned conventionally '
            'powered submarines were still suitable for Australia’s strategic '
            'needs. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '
            'Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said Morrison '
            'was “willing to trash alliances and partnerships for personal '
            'political interests, instead of simply admitting this could have '
            'been handled better”. “Mr Morrison needs to explain how selective '
            'text messages between him and the French president, and the '
            'contents of a confidential 15-page document negotiated in secret '
            'between President Biden’s National Security Council and '
            'Australian and British officials ended up in Australian '
            'newspapers,” Wong said. “Mr Morrison needs to rule out that this '
            'backgrounding came from him, his office or his government. His '
            'furious attempts at damage control will only make world leaders '
            'trust him less.” Morrison’s office on Tuesday declined to respond '
            'to Wong’s comments, pointing to the prime minister’s comments a '
            'day earlier.\n'
            'Morrison was asked in Glasgow on Monday: “Why did you decide to '
            'leak that text message?” The prime minister did not directly '
            'contest the claim, but said he didn’t intend to “indulge your '
            'editorial on that”. Morrison told reporters Macron “was concerned '
            'that this would be a phone call that would result in the decision '
            'of Australia not to proceed with the contract”. Morrison said the '
            'French defence system “flew into action” the day after his dinner '
            'with Macron at the Élysée Palace in June to seek to address '
            'issues with the project – including sending a French admiral to '
            'Australia “to try and save the contract”. The French embassy in '
            'Canberra did not comment on the release of the text message, '
            'although the ambassador, Jean-Pierre Thébault, is due to address '
            'the National Press Club on Wednesday.\n'
            'Comment has also been sought from the US embassy and the White '
            'House. Earlier, a senior White House official declined to clarify '
            'who Biden was referring to when he told Macron in Rome last week: '
            '“I was under the impression that France had been informed long '
            'before that the deal was not going through. I, honest to God, did '
            'not know you had not been.” Biden’s national security adviser, '
            'Jake Sullivan – when asked on Monday about Morrison’s handling of '
            'the matter – replied: “We should look forward and not backward.” '
            'Hervé Lemahieu, the research director at the Sydney-based Lowy '
            'Institute, said Australia had every right to decide to rescind '
            'the French contract and to enter into Aukus, but the '
            'communication with France “could have been handled with a bit '
            'more deft and diplomacy”. Lemahieu said the alleged release of '
            'the texts was “highly unconventional behaviour between state '
            'leaders” and reflected “how personalised the squabble has '
            'become”. “I think the key variable here is that both president '
            'Macron and prime minister Morrison are two men who face elections '
            'in 2022, and they both see the fracas as a blow to their prestige '
            'and their personal standing and they are primarily speaking to a '
            'domestic audience here, rather than to each other.” Lemahieu said '
            'he had been monitoring French news stories in recent days “and '
            'this is a bigger story in Australia than it is in France”.\n'
            'He said the handling of the communications with France was “as '
            'much an American mismanagement as an Australian one” – as the US '
            'is a formal treaty ally of France. Lemahieu said Biden had '
            '“basically decided that it was worth pushing Australia under the '
            'bus in order to salvage” the US relationship with France. The '
            'former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull – who announced '
            'the partnership with France to acquire submarines in 2016 – said '
            'Morrison “should apologise” to Macron “because he did very '
            'elaborately and duplicitously deceive France”. The former Labor '
            'prime minister Kevin Rudd said the situation had become an '
            '“extraordinary mess” where “we now have got heads of government, '
            'effectively, leaking against each other, in order to establish '
            'what transpired in these informal text messages between heads of '
            'government”. “Mr Morrison is now digging an even bigger hole for '
            'himself, not just in relation to the French, by effectively '
            'himself accusing the French president of lying, but also (in) '
            'extraordinary background briefing about the failure in Mr '
            'Morrison’s view of American officials to properly apprise the '
            'United States president of the nature of the cancellation of the '
            'French deal,” Rudd told the ABC.',

            'the UK’s largest banks in the months leading up to the Cop26 '
            'climate talks in Glasgow, according to a report by climate '
            'finance campaigners. The bank financed $5.6bn (£4.1bn) for new '
            'fossil fuel projects from January 2021 to the eve of the UN '
            'climate summit, Market Forces found, despite growing '
            'international warnings that any new fossil developments would '
            'destroy any chance of avoiding a catastrophic climate breakdown. '
            'Barclays’ multibillion pound support for fossil fuel projects was '
            'ranked ahead of that of HSBC, which financed $5.3bn this year, '
            'and Standard Chartered, which made $4.3bn available. The report '
            'found Barclays financed a $194m bond to the Canada-headquartered '
            'pipeline company Enbridge, which part-owns the controversial '
            'Dakota access pipeline which is expected to carry enough crude '
            'oil to produce the emissions of 30 coal plants every year. It '
            'also said the bank provided $200m to MEG Energy, which extracts '
            'Canadian tar sands oil, one of the most polluting fuels on the '
            'planet. The report also revealed how HSBC and Standard Chartered '
            'participated in a $6bn bond issuance to Saudi Aramco, the world’s '
            'most polluting company, and that HSBC financed a $1.5bn bond to '
            'Qatar Petroleum, which owns the world’s biggest gas field. The '
            'three banks have extended financing to fossil fuel companies '
            'despite committing to net zero carbon emissions from financing '
            'activity by 2050 and issuing warnings that no new fossil fuel '
            'projects are compatible with keeping global heating in check. The '
            'report’s findings came ahead of a series of Cop26 events '
            'scheduled for Wednesday that are intended to mobilise public and '
            'private finance to help tackle the climate emergency.\n'
            'Mia Watanabe, a campaigner at Market Forces, said: “Despite their '
            'warm words, these banks continue to finance fossil fuel companies '
            'and projects that are destroying the world’s hopes of meeting '
            'climate targets.” In a stunt to mark the latest report, Market '
            'Forces held a Formula One-style “prize giving” for the banks’ '
            '“race to disaster” outside Barclays’ Glasgow offices, which is a '
            'stone’s throw from the Cop26 venue. A previous annual report by '
            'the group that tracked global fossil fuel financing found that in '
            'the five years after the signing of the Paris agreement, the '
            'three banks combined financed more than $257bn in the coal, oil '
            'and gas sectors. That report found Barclays was the world’s '
            'seventh-biggest fossil fuel funder, and the biggest in Europe, '
            'while HSBC was ranked 13th in the world. Although Standard '
            'Chartered trailed at 34 globally, it is also the top UK financier '
            'of new coal plants in Asia, according to Market Forces.\n'
            'The latest report follow news that Jes Staley has stepped down as '
            'the chief executive of Barclays after an investigation by City '
            'regulators into how he described his relationship with the '
            'billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Standard Chartered said '
            'last week that it would set “ambitious new targets” to reach net '
            'zero from financed activity by 2050, including interim 2030 '
            'targets for the most carbon-intensive sectors, that were aligned '
            'with the International Energy Agency’s scenario for a net zero '
            'energy system by 2050. The global energy watchdog said in May '
            'that there could be no new oil, gas or coal development if the '
            'world was to reach net zero by 2050. Only days later a UN report '
            'warned that fossil fuel production planned by the world’s '
            'governments “vastly” exceeded the limit needed to keep the rise '
            'in global heating to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of the '
            'climate crisis. “The science is clear – banks that keep funding '
            'fossil fuels can’t be climate leaders,” Watanabe added. A '
            'spokesperson for Barclays was not immediately available to '
            'comment. A HSBC spokesperson said the bank was “firmly committed” '
            'to aligning its provision of finance to net zero by 2050 or '
            'sooner. “We have committed to phase out thermal coal financing by '
            '2030 in EU and OECD markets and by 2040 globally and to set out '
            'short and medium-term transition targets for the oil and gas and '
            'power and utilities sector. We expect to provide between $750bn '
            'and $1trn towards the net zero-transition by 2030,” the '

            'Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, maintains he acted '
            'appropriately and in the country’s national interests. Ahead of '
            'the G20 summit in Rome, the US president, Joe Biden, publicly '
            'observed to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the '
            'episode had been “clumsy”. On Sunday night, as the forum drew to '
            'a close, journalists asked Macron if he thought Morrison had lied '
            'to him about the plan. “I don’t think, I know,” he replied. On '
            'Monday, with leaders now gathered for Cop26 in Glasgow, Morrison '
            'shot back, telling reporters he refused to “cop sledging of '
            'Australia”.\n'
            'But while the diplomatic row has dominated headlines in '
            'Australia, French media have not so far showed much interest in '
            'the matter. “La crise des sous-marins” seems to be largely a '
            'footnote when discussing deteriorating US or cross-channel '

            'thrashing”, and proof of US disregard for France. On Monday '
            'morning, Le Parisien’s report noted principally that the incident '
            '“sparked a quarrel with the US”. On Monday afternoon, financial '
            'journal Les Echos referenced the submarine debate as a sign of '
            'London’s “perfidy” and desire to make trouble for Europe – but '
            'made no mention of Australia. On Monday night, Ouest-France '
            'reported on Morrison’s stand without further analysis. One French '
            'commentator did notice how “furious” the prime minister was over '
            'Macron’s accusation.\n'
            'But with Cop26 under way, Morrison’s comments otherwise got '

            'France’s relations with the UK, aggravating tensions over the '

{'article': 'Britain and France have been at loggerheads over post-Brexit '
            'fishing licences for UK waters since the start of the year. Talks '
            'are continuing but both sides have threatened action – and '
            'mistranslations have not helped. What’s at the heart of the row? '
            'Under the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), French '
            'fishers may continue to fish between six and 12 miles from the UK '
            'shore and off Guernsey and Jersey until 2026 if they have a '
            'discretionary licence issued by Britain. To be granted that '
            'licence, they must have previously fished in those waters between '
            '2012 and 2016 – but the two countries disagree over the evidence '
            'required for past activity, and how much of it should be needed. '
            'France says that for the six-to-12-mile zone and off Guernsey and '
            'Jersey, 210 licences have so far been granted whereas it '
            'requested 454. Authorities say only about 20 of Boulogne’s '
            '112-strong fleet are permitted to fish in that zone. The UK says '
            'it has granted about 1,700 licences, or 98% of EU applications. '
            'But that figure includes licences to fish in Britain’s exclusive '
            'economic zone between 12 and 200 miles from the coast, which were '
            'automatic under the terms of the TCA. The nub of the argument is '
            'that in the disputed zones (six-to-12 miles, and around Jersey '
            'and Guernsey), the TCA defines which boats qualify for licences '
            'through their past activity – but it does not specify exactly '
            'what proof is required. What are both sides threatening? France '
            'says the rules imposed by the UK, Jersey and Guernsey are unfair '
            'to smaller boats, which typically do not have the GPS equipment '
            'to prove past presence in UK waters. Britain says it is entitled '
            'to ask for the evidence it wants. The French president, Emmanuel '
            'Macron, called on Monday for further talks, lifting a threat to '
            'ban UK boats from unloading at some French ports, carry out extra '
            'licence checks, tighten controls of trucks and reinforce customs '
            'and hygiene controls from Tuesday. Both sides seem to believe the '
            'other has – or is about to – breach the terms of the TCA. '
            'France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said on Sunday that the '
            'UK had failed to issue a “significant amount” of licences and was '
            '“targeting one country”. This was “not a technical issue, it’s a '
            'political choice and a breach of the TCA”, he said. Britain’s '
            'foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday gave France 48 hours to '
            'withdraw its “completely unreasonable” threats, warning that the '
            'UK could otherwise “use the mechanisms of our trade agreement '
            'with the EU to take action”. What happens next? It depends how '
            'talks go, what, if any, measures France implements, and how the '
            'UK chooses to respond, but either or both parties could enter the '
            'TCA dispute settlement process. This would entail first going '
            'into consultations, then, if those fail, triggering arbitration. '
            'If one side is found to have breached TCA, it must comply with '
            'the ruling within a reasonable period or risk the winning side '
            'withdrawing TCA benefits. Given the rhetoric from both sides, and '
            'the domestic political advantage to be won from playing tough, it '
            'is hard to see a rapid de-escalation. There may be little '
            'appetite in the EU27 for a fish war, but there is also a sense '
            'Britain is pushing its luck too often. Matters have also not been '
            'helped by mistranslations. Boris Johnson on Sunday cited a letter '
            'from the French prime minister, Jean Castex, to the European '
            'Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, which he said called '
            'on the EU to “punish” Britain. Other reports said the letter '
            'asked the EU to “cause damage” to the UK. The phrase might be '
            'better translated as: “It is vital to show European public '
            'opinion that respect for commitments entered into is not '
            'negotiable, and that it is more detrimental to leave the EU than '
            'to remain in it.” The point was unfortunately phrased, but has '
            'been made by many EU leaders since the Brexit referendum.',

            'the state’s anti-corruption body releases its report into the '
            'conduct of the former premier Gladys Berejiklian, which the '
            'watchdog says won’t be until at least after February next year. '
            'On Tuesday the premier, Dominic Perrottet, told reporters he and '
            'many other MPs in NSW use a private phone to keep “professional '
            'work separate” from their private life. He was responding to '
            'questions in the wake of evidence before the Independent '
            'Commission Against Corruption that the former Wagga Wagga MP '
            'Daryl Maguire urged Berejiklian to “get a private phone” after he '
            'was summonsed to appear before the body in 2018.\n'
            'Icac also heard Maguire told Berejiklian “they can read texts” '
            'and suggested she download Chinese messaging app WeChat. '
            'Perrottet said on Tuesday he did not know about WeChat, but he '
            'was aware many MPs use WhatsApp for private communication. While '
            'Perrottet said it was “important that information that is '
            'relevant to ministerial decision-making is conducted in '
            'accordance with rules that are in place”, he stopped short of '
            'committing to changing the rules on the use of private '
            'communication methods including encrypted messaging apps. While '
            'Perrottet said he believed the NSW ministerial code of conduct '
            'was “incredibly strong” he also said the government would '
            'consider changes. But only if it came with a recommendation from '
            'Icac. “If [the ministerial code] needs to be [reviewed] from time '
            'to time, based on changes in technology, the government will '
            'always look at it,” he said. “One of the important roles that '
            'Icac also play is in corruption prevention and providing advice '
            'to government, which they do from time to time on the changes '
            '[that] should be made and I would assume that would also include '
            'potential changes to the code of conduct.” On the final day of '
            'its hearings into Berejiklian’s conduct, the former NSW premier '
            'told the inquiry it was common for MPs to have private phones, '
            'and that she had often been encouraged to use one by colleagues. '
            'Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian '
            'Australia every morning\n'
            'The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, also stopped short of '
            'calling for changes to the code on the use of phones. “At the end '
            'of the day ministerial communication and communication on behalf '
            'of any member of parliament is subject to oversight by '
            'investigative bodies and I think every MP knows that,” he said. '
            '“We’d wait for the Icac findings to come down before I make a '
            'policy change or recommend [one] to the NSW government but you '
            'know we’re public officials and that needs to be at the forefront '
            'of our mind when we’re making decisions.” But those findings '
            'won’t be made public for some months. On Tuesday the watchdog '
            'released a timetable saying submissions from the inquiry’s '
            'counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, were not due until 20 '
            'December. The submissions in reply from lawyers for Berejiklian '
            'and Maguire were not due until 14 February 2022.\n'
            'Icac has been the subject of fierce criticism in some quarters '
            'over the timing of its inquiry into Berejiklian, which prompted '
            'her resignation as the state navigated the end of its long '
            'Covid-19 lockdown in October. On Friday the commission’s '
            'inspector, Bruce McClintock SC, tabled a report in the NSW '
            'parliament which revealed that he had decided to conduct an '
            'investigation into the decision to launch the inquiry after '
            'receiving “several complaints” about the decision. “The Icac '
            'itself has informed me that it too received complaints from '
            'members of the public in relation to this matter,” he wrote in '
            'the report. But having reviewed the watchdog’s conduct, '
            'McClintock found it had acted “lawfully and in conformity” with '
            'the act, and was not unreasonable. He also dismissed complaints '
            'about the timing of the investigation, saying Icac could have '
            'been accused of “partiality” towards Berejiklian if it did not '
            'launch the probe.\n'
            '“Having concluded that there was sufficient basis to investigate '
            'the matters in question further and hold a public inquiry, I '
            'believe the commission was correct to proceed as it did,” he '
            'wrote. “Had it failed to do so, it could itself have been '
            'justifiably accused of failing to perform its statutory functions '
            'and, indeed, of partiality to the premier.” During his first '
            'press conference as premier, Perrottet said changes to the '
            'watchdog’s power were not a priority for him, and on Tuesday he '
            'said he would not comment on the body’s powers until after its '
            'report was complete. “The independent commission needs to have, '
            'free from political interference, the opportunity to conclude its '
            'work and to provide a public report and when they provide a '
            'public report, we’ll consider that report and if there’s any '
            'action … we need to take, we will,” he said.',

            'Christmas in 2012, so it was a very exciting day to start off '

            'really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water '
            'rising just around the house. At around 4.30, I heard my husband '
            'screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong. By the '
            'time I made it outside, there was a massive gush of water coming '
            'towards our house, like an inland tsunami. My husband yelled to '
            'grab the kids. My baby was sitting on the toilet. I grabbed him '
            'by the arm. The water was rising so quickly that by the time we '
            'made it out of the house, the water was up to our hips. We were '
            'already struggling.\n'
            'We have four children and so my husband and I had one child on '
            'each arm as we waded through the water. There was one point where '
            'my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I '
            'thought: please, please, Heavenly Father, don’t let us have to '

            'storeroom. Our entire house was gone, our cars had been washed '
            'away, big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the '
            'ground had washed away – that’s how strong the water was. We '
            'stayed up in the storeroom for several hours, wrapped in old, '
            'dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm. I remember thinking: if we '
            'make it out alive, how and where are we going to start all over '
            'again? We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost '

{'article': 'It was a transformation as outlandish as anything in his fiction. '
            'In late Victorian Kent, Herbert George Wells was a shopkeeper’s '
            'sickly son threatening to kill himself if he couldn’t study '
            'science rather than fester in a hated apprenticeship. By the '
            '1900s, not yet 40 and already with a string of future sci-fi '
            'classics to his name (The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The '
            'Island of Doctor Moreau), he was en route to global stardom, '
            'hobnobbing at the White House and settling into life as a '
            'Jaeger-suited serial shagger who, 5ft 8in on his tiptoes, bedded '
            'a roll call of contemporary literary talent, from Dorothy '
            'Richardson to Rebecca West, all while playing a growing field of '
            'publishers and agents eager for a storytelling gift powerful '
            'enough to sow panic that Earth was under alien attack, at least '
            'among listeners to Orson Welles’s 1938 radio broadcast of The War '
            'of the Worlds. As Claire Tomalin’s sprightly new biography points '
            'out, Wells only turned to writing because dodgy lungs forced him '
            'to give up teaching, yet cork-lined isolation was never to be his '
            'lot. When sex with his first wife, Isabel, proved disappointing, '
            'he got divorced, having already set up with a student, Amy, whom, '
            'astoundingly, he renamed Jane. Once she was pregnant with their '
            'first child, he argued (apparently successfully) that he should '
            'be free to sleep around while she kept house, because she was '
            '“fragile” and he required a “complete loveliness of bodily '
            'response”.\n'
            'Nor was Wells for monogamy in prose. Initially seen as an English '
            'Jules Verne on account of his futuristic early fiction, he soon '
            'switched to comic social realism fed by a class-climber’s eye for '
            'detail (Kipps, Tono-Bungay), all the while churning out '
            'journalism, reviews, historical and scientific textbooks and '
            'political tracts. His influence on George Orwell wasn’t only down '
            'to his fiction – a germ of Nineteen Eighty-Four lies in Wells’s '
            'When the Sleeper Wakes, about a man who rises from a 200-year '
            'slumber to find London under fascist rule and ravaged by air war '
            '– but also in his persona as a public intellectual ready to hold '
            'forth, whatever the issue of the day. Having cut his teeth during '
            'a late Victorian print boom fuelled by the growth of the reading '
            'public, he was well placed to take advantage of the era; he even '
            'got to know his second wife while commuting on the newly opened '
            'District line. A certain shamelessness aided Wells’s rise: who '
            'else would have thought to ask the prime minister for a stipend? '
            '(Balfour said no, in part because Wells was already earning more '
            'than a grand a year, a healthy six-figure sum today.) Most of '
            'all, there was Wells’s hunger for work: bashing out 7,000 words a '
            'day, he never shook the jobbing writer’s fear of going under, a '
            'prospect made stark when a loyal confrère died of pneumonia at '
            '30. Tomalin wonders aloud how Wells managed, while laying out '
            'abundant evidence of how the sausage was made. Witness her '
            'paragraph on the death of his mother in June 1905: “She had '
            'fallen down the stairs at Easter… Wells went over and found a '
            'nurse to help out, but he was too busy to stay and was not there '
            'when she died. He arrived soon afterwards and cleared up her '
            'affairs. Then back to work. In October 1905, Kipps was published '
            'and sold 12,000 copies before Christmas – good news for Wells’s '
            'finances.” Tomalin leans heavily on Wells’s 1934 memoir An '
            'Experiment in Autobiography, which sometimes lends a dutiful air '
            'to proceedings, particularly during the scene-setting of the '
            'early years. A bigger problem is the way paraphrase can slip into '
            'endorsement. Comparing Wells with his contemporary George '
            'Gissing, Tomalin says that Gissing let himself “be humiliated and '
            'defeated – by women and by life – while Wells knew how to work '
            'for success, how to enjoy women and the world and how to fight '
            'and – usually – to win”. Yet such terms of approval sit ill with '
            'Wells’s conduct as portrayed here, not least because one of '
            'Tomalin’s coups is to quote from his unpublished letters to Amber '
            'Reeves, a midlife lover who was a Cambridge student half his age: '
            '“Didn’t I have Isabel because I wanted her and chucked her '
            'because I wanted to and have Jane? I never gave up anything I '
            'wanted (and I ain’t going to do so now).” When Reeves was '
            'pregnant, Wells’s wife bought the baby clothes; when Wells’s stay '
            'with Reeves at a French villa didn’t work out – apparently she '
            'was no good at keeping house – he made good on his outlay by '
            'bringing Jane and his sons there instead. Tomalin’s decision to '
            'restrict herself to the “young” Wells never strikes the reader as '
            'anything but pragmatic, despite her explanation that she found '
            'herself particularly drawn to the phase of his best-remembered '
            'fiction. In any case, Tomalin keeps pace with her subject into '
            'midlife, in part, she says, because he continued to behave like a '
            'young man, which is rather a polite way to call him immature. '
            'Perhaps the psychic dislocation of rapid celebrity meant he never '
            'felt quite secure. The notion, given voice in 1909’s Tono-Bungay, '
            'that “every human being had a ‘place’. It belonged to you from '
            'your birth like the colour of your eyes”, was one his personal '
            'striving – the philandering and politicking as well as the '
            'fiction – always sought to undo. During one of the bouts of '
            'sickness that pockmarked his youth, he feared he might die a '
            'virgin without becoming famous; achievement unlocked, to say the '
            'least, but at what cost? Tomalin’s generous reserve lets her '
            'reader decide. • The Young HG Wells: Changing the World by Claire '

            'Along with the Pixel 6 Pro, the Pixel 6 is the first phone to '
            'feature Google’s custom Tensor processor. It matches rivals from '
            'Qualcomm and Samsung on speed, but is better optimised for '
            'Google’s various AI systems. Battery life is good but not great, '
            'lasting about 34 hours between charges, putting on par with '
            'rivals from Samsung and but some way behind 46-hour iPhone 13. '
            'That was with the screen on for about five hours in various '
            'messaging, note-taking and utility apps, the browser and taking '
            'about 20 photos, spending about two hours on 5G and the rest on '
            'wifi. Sustainability\n'
            'Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery. '
            'Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their '
            'original capacity after 500 full charge cycles. The Pixel 6 is '
            'generally repairable by Google and third-party repair shops. '
            'Screen repairs cost £129, back glass repairs cost £139 and '
            'battery replacements cost £89 out of warranty. The Pixel 6 '
            'contains 100% recycled aluminium in its frame, accounting for '
            'about 14% of the phone by weight. The company publishes '
            'environmental impact reports for some of its products. Google '
            'will recycle all Pixel devices free of charge. Android 12\n'
            'The Pixel 6 ships with Google’s latest Android 12, which includes '
            'a load of customisation options and refinements. For more, see '
            'the Pixel 6 Pro review. Google will provide at least three years '
            'of major Android updates and monthly security fixes. It will then '
            'provide an additional two years of updates with the “frequency '
            'and categories of updates depending on the hardware capabilities '
            'and needs”. Samsung supports its top phones for four years, while '
            'Fairphone is aiming for six years and Apple supports its iPhone '
            'for up to seven years. Camera\n'
            'The Pixel 6 has the same 50-megapixel main and 12MP ultrawide '
            'camera as the 6 Pro and produces very similar results. That makes '
            'it one of the very best cameras you can get on a smartphone, '
            'particularly at under £600. It lacks an optical zoom camera, and '
            'while Google’s up to 7x digital zoom is one of the best, it is no '
            'substitute for optical magnification. The 8MP selfie camera is '
            'good, producing detailed shots with lots of drama, but '
            'occasionally the images were a bit soft, particularly in lower '
            'light levels. Observations\n'
            'Call quality and 5G reception was good, as was Bluetooth '
            'performance to several sets of headphones. The bottom corners '
            'were noticeably hard, digging in more than other devices in my '
            'palm when holding it one-handed. The volume and power buttons '
            'work well but are a little loose, allowing them to rattle a bit. '
            'Price The Google Pixel 6 costs £599 ($599/A$999) with 128GB of '
            'storage. For comparison, the Pixel 6 Pro costs £849, Pixel 4a '
            'costs £349, the OnePlus 9 costs £629, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ '
            'costs £949, the Xiaomi 11T Pro costs £599, the iPhone 13 costs '
            '£779 and the Fairphone 4 costs £499. Verdict Where the Pixel 6 '
            'Pro is about competing on an equal footing with the top '
            'smartphones on the market, the Pixel 6 offers all of what makes '
            'Google phones great while significantly undercutting the '
            'competition on price. You get snappy performance, decent battery '
            'life, Google’s top new chip and a slick experience packed with '
            'all the software bells and whistles you can’t get anywhere else. '
            'Google’s local AI-powered voice and keyboard typing is quite '
            'something, and you will get at least five years of security '
            'updates from release. Plus the phone has the main and ultrawide '
            'lenses of Google’s next-generation class-leading camera system. '
            'The lack of an optical zoom and slightly picky fingerprint '
            'scanner can be forgiven for the price. Costing just £599, the '
            'Pixel 6 is priced more in line with Chinese challenger brands '
            'than the top Samsung and Apple devices with which it competes '
            'favourably. That makes the Pixel 6 is a real bargain for a '
            'top-flight phone. You have to spend considerably more to get a '
            'better Android phone than this. Pros: class-leading camera, great '
            'screen, excellent performance, good battery life, recycled '
            'aluminium, five years of security updates, Android 12, impressive '
            'local AI features, very competitively priced. Cons: fairly slow '
            'charging, no optical zoom, fingerprint scanner can be picky, no '
            'face unlock option, only three years of Android version updates '
            'despite five years of security support.\n'

{'article': 'There are calls for Priti Patel to withdraw or justify claims she '
            'made before parliament that most people who travel to the UK in '
            'small boats are not genuine asylum seekers. Two Labour peers, '
            'David Blunkett and Shami Chakrabarti, have also questioned '
            'whether the home secretary has evidence that backs her claim that '
            '“70% of individuals on small boats are single men who are '
            'effectively economic migrants”. There is deepening concern from '
            'refugee charities that the government is feeding an untrue '
            'narrative that claims migrants who travel to the UK by boat are '
            'undeserving of sympathy. At the Lords home affairs and justice '
            'committee last week, Patel was questioned about her new policy of '
            'deeming any person who arrives in the UK to claim asylum after '
            'passing through a “safe” country as “inadmissible” – meaning '
            'their claim will not be considered. Describing the people who '
            'would fall into this category, she said: “In the last year, 70% '
            'of individuals on small boats are single men who are effectively '
            'economic migrants. They are not genuine asylum seekers.” Home '
            'Office officials were asked to provide data that backed up the '
            'home secretary’s assertions. A source from the department said '
            'that of 8,500 people arriving by small boat in 2020 87% were men '
            'and 74% were aged between 18 and 39 – but did not provide '
            'evidence related to their asylum claims. A Home Office '
            'spokesperson said: “France is a safe country; people should claim '
            'asylum in the first safe country they reach rather than making '
            'dangerous and illegal crossings.” Lady Chakrabarti, the former '
            'head of Liberty and a member of the committee, said Patel’s '
            'comments should be properly explained, corrected or withdrawn. '
            '“Both the refugee convention and the lives of desperate people '
            'are too precious for the home secretary’s 70% statement to go '
            'unchallenged,” she said. “Is the Home Office really saying that '
            'most single male asylum seekers or most people crossing the '
            'Channel are ‘economic migrants’ and unworthy of refuge? If yes, '
            'what happened to giving anxious scrutiny to every individual '
            'claim for asylum?” Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home '
            'secretary who asked Patel the question that provoked the “70%” '
            'response, said the government could struggle to justify the '
            'figure because officials were still processing a backlog of '
            'asylum claims. “It is not surprising that the Home Office has not '
            'responded [to the Guardian’s request to justify the 70% claim] '
            'given that the backlog of cases is so extreme. The latest figure '
            'I saw was 125,000, which exceeds many previous years. “There is a '
            'presumption being made by the home secretary about their claims '
            'before they have had an opportunity to make their claims. Until '
            'the backlog is massively reduced we won’t know about those '
            'arrivals who come over the summer,” he said.\n'
            'In oral evidence to the home affairs select committee in '
            'September 2020, Abi Tierney, the director general of UK Visas and '
            'Immigration, stated that of 5,000 people who had crossed in 2020 '
            'until the date of the committee meeting, 98% had claimed asylum. '
            'Published Home Office data shows that many of those arriving on '
            'small boats whose claims were deemed inadmissible originate from '
            'conflict zones such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. Dr '
            'Peter Walsh, a researcher at the Migration Observatory at the '
            'University of Oxford, said: “A majority of asylum claims '
            '(including those of people who arrived in the UK by small boat) '
            'are ultimately successful. Specifically, the Home Office reports '
            'that 59% of claims filed in 2017 to 2019 inclusive were '
            'ultimately successful, accounting for appeals. “It is reasonable '
            'to suppose that Channel migrants will be more likely than other '
            'asylum seekers to have their asylum claims granted. This is '
            'because the nationalities that are most common among Channel '
            'migrants – like Iranian, Syrian, Afghan and Yemeni – have a '
            'higher-than-average likelihood of ultimately being successful. It '
            'is not clear what evidence exists to support the claim that 70% '
            'of Channel migrants are economic migrants. But on the basis of '
            'the available data, it seems unlikely that no more than 30% of '
            'Channel migrants would have their asylum claims accepted.”',

{'article': 'There was a fair amount of pet regret when the lockdowns ended; '
            'helplines were inundated. They rarely reported what the questions '
            'were, but you can guess: “How much love will ever be enough for '
            'this dog?”; “How can I tell if my cat’s being sarcastic?” In '
            'fact, the most regretted pet was a rabbit. People get them for '
            'children, but it’s a terrible fit, because there is nothing '
            'rabbits find more annoying than children. They also hate being '
            'picked up, stroked, handled in any way, regarded or addressed by '
            'name. “Let your rabbit come to you,” all the literature says, '
            'leaving experience to teach you how that sentence ends … “which '
            'it never will.” Yet over time, inevitably, you fall in love with '
            'the rabbit. I can’t explain it. It’s something in the way they '
            'move. Every hop is like a Disney movie. It’s like falling in love '
            'with a dancer from Strictly. They don’t even know you exist, but '
            'every little thing they do is lovely, so what are you gonna do? '
            'No point fighting it. One other thing the manuals don’t mention '
            'so often – rabbits die. They die constantly. They die of nothing. '
            'They die because they ate their own fur and it tangled their '
            'intestines. They die because a cat gave them a mean look. That is '
            'why they breed so fast, because they are not going to make even '
            'the most rudimentary effort to survive. My last but one rabbit to '
            'die – Peachy – went so fast from hopping to expiry that by the '
            'time I got him to the night vet, she said: “What do you want, an '
            'autopsy?” Mr Z and I went straight to the pub with our empty pet '

            'insanely attention-seeking mime (which you might say is all '

            'to cope with death. In fact, all any of us have learned is to '

            'foreign aid and the cost of domestic flights while mulling a new '
            'coalmine and a Shetland oilfield. The absurd Brexit fishing spat '
            'makes a mockery of exhorting other world leaders to lift their '
            'sights to the horizons of the climate crisis. The scale of what’s '
            'needed is politically unfathomable. Yet Johnson pretends answers '
            'can be conjured up “without so much as a hair shirt in sight”. In '
            'thundering, prophetic form, a recent article from George Monbiot '
            'set him right: the world’s richest 1% emit 35 times what each '
            'individual should use to ensure global heating does not exceed a '
            '1.5C rise. The super-rich use their fortunes to shape the '
            'political agenda, diverting our attention from the true climate '
            'culprits with the “micro consumerist bollocks” of ditching coffee '
            'cups and plastic bags. “We will endure only if we cease to '
            'consent,” Monbiot writes – and he’s right. But as ever the '
            'political problem is how to get the world’s people to rebel. In '
            'Britain, voters increasingly care about the climate; it has risen '
            'to a close fourth place behind the leading concerns of Brexit, '
            'Covid and the economy. Concern is strongest in London and the '
            'south of England (33% compared with 24% nationally), social grade '
            'AB (34%), and the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups (31% and 35% '
            'respectively). When cowardly politicians fail to lead, the '
            'question is how to use every imaginable instrument to engage '
            'everyone all the time. Greta Thunberg is a remarkably wise '
            'campaigner, who understands the politics of persuasion. Yes, it’s '
            'necessary that some people get annoyed with school strikes and '
            'road blocks, she told Andrew Marr on Sunday, but with this '
            'important message: “There is no final tipping point where '
            'everything is lost. If we miss 1.5C then we go for 1.6C then '
            '1.7C. It is never too late to do as much as we can.” That’s a '
            'vital thought to ward off despairing nihilism. Here’s one action '
            'that will be necessary: carbon taxes. Writing in the Financial '
            'Times, the economist Tim Harford recently suggested that every '
            'product needs a carbon price attached, sending a signal not just '
            'to the buyer, but right down every supply chain to use less '
            'energy in growing, manufacturing and transporting a product to '
            'attract less tax. That will be necessary. But any climate-abating '
            'tax brings on green crocodile tears for poor people, often from '
            'the same Tory MPs who just voted to remove the £20 universal '
            'credit uplift. The claim that carbon taxes would '
            'disproportionately affect the poorest people was what killed off '
            'the fuel price escalator – a yearly tax increase devised by the '
            'Tories in 1993 to discourage driving – after owner-driver '
            'hauliers blockaded oil refineries in 2000. When the climate '
            'demands that fuel taxes rise, politicians make them fall. There '
            'are subtler ways to impose carbon taxes. In 2006, the former '
            'Labour environment secretary David Miliband put forward a radical '
            'scheme for tradable personal carbon allowances (PCAs). Everyone '
            'would have a carbon allowance to spend on heating, petrol or '
            'flying, issued by a central carbon bank. The national allowance '
            'would shrink each year to cut personal carbon emissions. The '
            'well-off use the most carbon – they have big houses, drive SUVs '
            'and fly frequently – while half the population never flies, and '
            'many live in flats or small homes. Some 17m households have no '
            'car. Carbon credits would be tradable, so those using least could '
            'profit by selling some of their allowance, while heavy users '
            'would have to buy their spare credits via the carbon bank. This '
            'policy could be a potential win-win-win: it would fix an annual '
            'reduction in carbon emissions and redistribute cash from the '
            'extravagant to the carbon thrifty in this most unequal country. '
            'Above all it would engage everyone to think hard about their '
            'carbon consumption, giving them an incentive to save or profit. '
            'Miliband’s speech advocating the scheme labelled it “a thought '
            'experiment”, as it was way out ahead of timid government policy. '
            'But four official feasibility studies were commissioned. Some '
            'suggested the measure was too technically difficult, but that was '
            'before the first iPhone, let alone the supermarket smart cards '
            'that count each purchase. Some warned of the bravery this untried '
            'system would require. Others said it was a clunky, bureaucratic '
            'way to impose carbon taxes – but that misses the key point of '
            'engaging every citizen: VAT is invisible to most shoppers. Prof '
            'Paul Ekins of University College London’s Institute for '
            'Sustainable Resources co-authored an official Defra report in '
            '2008 which found the idea feasible and relatively fair, but '
            'decided it was too radical for the government, who dismissed it '
            'as “an interesting concept ... ahead of its time”. Ekins and '
            'other researchers now think its time has come. By the time '
            'feasibility reports emerged, Miliband had moved to the Foreign '
            'Office, but he remains convinced PCAs could make a key '
            'contribution, though like any single action, “this is no silver '
            'bullet,” he told me: the heaviest lifting must be done by '
            'governments and industry more than individual consumers. “It’s a '
            'nudge – but with teeth and carrots.” Of all the colossal '
            'transformations needed, the hardest will be changing public '
            'attitudes. PCAs could kickstart public demand for the big capital '
            'collective programmes that would be necessary to conserve '
            'allowances, such as district heating schemes, rather than every '
            'flat or terraced house buying an expensive heat pump. “People are '
            'desperate to do something, but too often they get trivial advice, '
            'such as pre-rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. '
            'A personal carbon allowance system would tell them what they '
            'could do to make a real difference,” Prof Ekins says. At the '
            'heart of behaviour change is an “I will if you will” certainty '
            'that demands tough government action. By adding in the true price '
            'to the planet, PCAs challenge the notion that economic growth in '
            'a developed country is the only goal. Do I think this government '
            'of the rich for the rich would do it? No chance. But I think it '
            'could be popular. There would be more winners than losers. And '
            'PCAs would be a fairer way to lower emissions in a transition '
            'that will inevitably require hair shirts for some – despite '
            'Johnson’s magical thinking. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist',

{'article': 'Toyota has released details about its first mass-produced '
            'electric vehicle in a significant step for the world’s '
            'second-biggest carmaker. The bZ4X is an SUV with optional rooftop '
            'solar panels that will be sold in both front-wheel or '
            'all-wheel-drive variants. The public had its first look at the '
            'concept for the bZ4X – “bZ” stands for “beyond zero” – at the '
            'Shanghai motor show in April this year, but Toyota only published '
            'the details of the car on Friday. The announcement is a step '
            'forward for Toyota, which has been slower to move into purely '
            'battery-powered electric vehicles than its competitors, relying '
            'heavily on hybrid technology instead.\n'
            'While the car isn’t Toyota’s first electrified vehicle – that '
            'title was held by the short-lived RAV4 EV – it marks the first '
            'electric vehicle that will directly compete with industry rivals '
            'such as the Hyundai Ioniq and the Tesla Model Y. Toyota already '
            'produces the second-generation Mirai, an electrified vehicle '
            'powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The bZ4X will be launched in '
            'Europe on 2 December, with orders to be placed by reservation. It '
            'is expected the model will enter series production from the '
            'middle of next year across “all regions worldwide” – though the '
            'precise timing, price and variants available has yet to be '
            'released. Toyota expects this will form an extended range of 70 '
            'electrified vehicles by 2025. Subaru helped developed the vehicle '
            'and is expected to reveal its own EV model next year. It is '
            'anticipated the bZX4 will arrive in Australia by late 2022. As '
            'Australia’s most popular car brand, it is expected the model will '
            'help Toyota take a dominant position in the country’s growing '
            'electric vehicle market, as its competitors have been put off by '
            'a lack of clear political leadership in making the transition. '
            'Hybrid vehicles accounted for nearly a third of Toyota’s total '
            'sales in Australia this year. The bZ4x will be the first of 15 '
            'planned zero-emissions vehicles offered by Toyota, including '
            'seven bZ models.\n'
            'The front-wheel drive version comes with a 150kw motor with 265 '
            'Nm of torque that is capable of zero to 100km/h in 8.4 seconds. '
            'The all-wheel-drive model comes equipped with two 80kW motors '
            'that produce a combined 160kW and 336Nm of torque, capable of '
            'zero to 100km/h in 7.7 seconds. Both variants will have a top '
            'speed of 160km/h, and will come with a 71.4kWh battery offering a '
            'range of roughly 500km. Toyota says the 150kW DC charger will '
            'allow the batteries to be recharged to 80% in 30 minutes. Solar '
            'panels can be built into the roof for use while driving or when '
            'parked. Toyota says these panels will add an extra 1800km of '
            'driving distance each year, while allowing the car to be charged '
            'when parked or where there are no charging stations easily '
            'available.\n'
            'At 4.69m long, 1.65m high and 1.86m wide the bZ4X will be similar '
            'in size to the Hyundai Ioniq. While the company has not released '
            'complete details of the interior, among the more unique aspects '
            'is the steer-by-wire system which works without any direct '
            'mechanical link between the steering wheel and the tyres. The '
            'technology is similar to the fly-by-wire system used by modern '
            'jet aircraft and means the driver will only receive feedback from '
            'the road, as they will not feel vibrations from the tyres via the '
            'steering wheel. This aircraft feel is extended with the option '
            'for a “yoke” steering wheel similar to the Tesla Model S. Toyota '
            'says its version will deliver better performance with 150 degrees '
            'of lock so the driver will not have to change hand positions when '
            'turning.',

            'able to receive the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 before the '
            'end of 2021 if Australia follows the lead of the United States. '
            'On 29 October, the Federal Drug Administration approved Pfizer’s '
            'mRNA vaccine for emergency use in American children aged five to '
            '11 years. If it is recommended by the US Centres for Disease '

            'years in the US. Pfizer’s application for use in Australia Pfizer '
            'supplied initial data on the vaccine for five to 11-year-olds to '
            'Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on 26 October. '
            'During the health minister’s press conference the next day, the '
            'head of the TGA, Professor John Skerritt, said “it will take a '
            'few weeks [for approval of the vaccine for 5-11-year-olds] but I '
            'would hope that we get there by the end of November”. Here’s the '
            'crux of the issue about Covid-19 vaccinations for younger '
            'children. Australian and international data demonstrate children '
            'in this five to 11 age group typically get mild disease; unwell '
            'with fever, vomiting, and cough, but worrying parents. However, '
            'some do get very sick, need hospitalisation, ICU, get long Covid '
            'and rarely, can die. The US has had 558 Covid-19-associated child '
            'deaths (0-17 years) and 94 were aged five to 11, Canada has had '
            '17 deaths in children (under 18 years), and Australia has had two '
            'deaths in children (in their teens). Yet, according to the '
            'Indonesian Paediatric Society, Covid-19 has caused death in more '
            'than 1,245 Indonesian children, half of whom were under one year '
            'of age. Australia however has had far fewer cases of Covid-19 '
            'than most countries globally. Although severe outcomes from '
            'Covid-19 are more typical in children with underlying conditions, '
            'that is not always the case, and up to 30% of children who become '
            'severely ill have no known risk factors. So, we have vaccines. '
            'Pfizer’s is the first trial of a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine for this '
            'age group. There were no serious adverse events due to '
            'vaccination reported in the trial but we know that mRNA vaccines '
            'have, very rarely, caused myocarditis and/or pericarditis in '
            'teens and young adults at a rate of one or two per 100,000. The '
            'risk of developing myocarditis/pericarditis from the vaccine is '
            'much less than with Covid-19 itself: the Australian Technical '
            'Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) notes the benefits of '
            'vaccination outweigh risks in all age groups. Many countries have '
            'already started vaccinating younger children against Covid-19. '
            'For instance, Slovakia launched Pfizer vaccination for vulnerable '
            'five to 11-year-olds on 9 September. Cuba has been vaccinating '
            'children aged two to 10 with Cuban-developed vaccines. China has '
            'been vaccinating vulnerable three- to 17-year-olds since June '
            'using Sinovac, and will soon mandate vaccines to attend school. '
            'Chile and Cambodia have also been vaccinating six- to '
            '12-year-olds with Sinovac since September. The United Arab '
            'Emirates has been giving Sinopharm to three to 17-year-olds since '
            'August and India approved their Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin Covid-19 '
            'vaccine for two to 18-year-olds two weeks ago. The impact of '
            'Covid-19 on young children In the current surge of cases in the '
            'UK, school-age children are about 15 times as likely to be '
            'infected as 80-year-olds and are believed to be driving the high '
            'UK case numbers. Similarly, and consistent with international '
            'data, children under 10 are the fastest growing age group '
            'contracting Covid-19 in Australia. To date in Australia, 21,616 '
            'children aged under nine years and 46,297 children under 19 years '
            'have tested positive for Covid-19; with about 2.5% to 3% of these '
            'children requiring hospitalisation. This is similar to the US, '
            'where about 2% of children with Covid-19 required '
            'hospitalisation, out of the 6.3 million American children aged '
            'under 18 who tested positive. There have been 5,217 cases of the '
            'rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome following Covid-19 '
            'infection in children in the US. Children with Covid-19 can '
            'transmit the infection. It is particularly difficult for '
            'household members to keep social distance from a sick young '
            'child. In New South Wales alone, 67 schools have been closed so '
            'far during term four because of a Covid case in a student and/or '
            'staff. Kids (and teachers) must take time off school if infected '
            'with Covid-19 or are a close contact of a positive case. Parents '
            'must take time off work to care for their sick and/or isolating '
            'children. Few good quality data are available on long Covid in '
            'children, so we don’t yet know the real risk. Estimates of '
            'prevalence of long Covid in children and adolescents range from '
            '0% to 27% with the true prevalence likely about 4%. Affected '
            'children report ongoing symptoms such as extreme fatigue, '
            'disturbance of taste and smell, headaches, and “brain fog’”. '
            'Anticipated uptake of the vaccine for younger children Currently '
            'there are no alternatives to the Pfizer vaccine for young '
            'children though Moderna’s is currently under trial. The '

{'article': 'Top story: ‘Zero chance if we lose the great forests’ Hello, '
            'Warren Murray here to embiggen your knowledge of current affairs. '
            'World leaders have agreed a deal that aims to halt and reverse '
            'global deforestation over the next decade as part of a '
            'multibillion-dollar package to tackle human-caused greenhouse gas '
            'emissions. By signing the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forest '
            'and Land Use, presidents and prime ministers from major producers '
            'and consumers of deforestation-linked products will commit to '
            'protect forest ecosystems. Boris Johnson will unveil the '
            'agreement at the Cop26 summit in the presence of the US '
            'president, Joe Biden, the Prince of Wales and the Indonesian '
            'president, Joko Widodo. Writing in the Guardian today, the UK '
            'environment minister Zac Goldsmith hails the forests deal as '
            '“unprecedented … Globally, nature-based solutions such as '
            'forests, mangroves and peatlands could provide about a third of '
            'the most effective and cost-effective solutions to the climate '
            'crisis that we need now – but currently, they attract just 3% of '
            'total global climate finance. If we were to lose any of the '
            'world’s great forests, we would have zero chance of stabilising '
            'the world’s climate.” The commitment comes as more than 120 world '
            'leaders meet in Glasgow to thrash out fresh commitments on '
            'cutting greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that key '
            'countries have failed to step up. In developments so far, India '
            'has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070 – seen by experts '
            'as a realistic commitment, but 20 years behind the 2050 date '
            'agreed by other countries; while the the Queen called on leaders '
            'to “rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true '
            'statesmanship”, for the sake of future generations. * * * Fishing '
            'talks ‘need to continue’ – Emmanuel Macron has shelved his threat '
            'to clog up UK exports and ban its fishers from landing catches at '
            'French ports from this morning in a dispute over access to '
            'British fishing waters. A proposal was put forward by Macron’s '
            'government late on Monday and discussions resumed. “The talks '
            'need to continue,” Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the '
            'Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. David Frost, the UK’s Brexit '
            'secretary, is to meet Clément Beaune, the French minister for EU '
            'affairs, in Paris on Thursday to discuss possible ways out of the '
            'crisis. * * * ‘Devastating’ – Thousands of babies in England are '
            'being born prematurely, smaller than expected or stillborn '
            'because of “alarming” and “devastating” socioeconomic and racial '
            'inequalities, a study has suggested. Research involving more than '
            '1m births suggests socioeconomic inequalities account for a '
            'quarter of all stillbirths, a fifth of preterm births, and a '
            'third of cases of foetal growth restriction (FGR) in which babies '
            'are smaller than expected for their gestational age. One in 10 '
            'stillbirths and almost one in five FGR cases are due to racial '
            'inequalities, the study suggests. Prof Jan van der Meulen of the '
            'London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, a co-lead author of '
            'the study, said: “National targets to make pregnancy safer will '
            'only be achieved if there is a concerted effort by midwives, '
            'obstetricians, public health professionals and politicians to '
            'tackle the broader socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities.” * * * '
            'Less than smart – The construction of smart motorways should be '
            'paused until promised safety improvements have been delivered and '
            'there is more evidence to assess the risks, MPs have urged. The '
            'transport select committee criticised as premature the decision '
            'by Grant Shapps in March 2020 to press ahead with the '
            'controversial motorways, which manage road speeds through '
            'electronic signs and do not have a hard shoulder. The report said '
            'available evidence regarding safety was “limited and volatile”, '
            'and urged greater powers for the Office of Rail and Road to block '
            'new road schemes until it was satisfied of their safety. They are '
            'calling for more emergency refuge areas never more than one mile '
            'apart, and every 0.75 miles where possible. The highway code '
            'should also be updated with instructions to drivers to create '
            'corridors to allow emergency services through. * * * Bosnian '
            'peace under threat – Christian Schmidt, the UN-backed high '
            'representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, has warned that the '
            'country is in imminent danger of breaking apart. The Bosnian Serb '
            'leader, Milorad Dodik, has threatened to force the Bosnian part '
            'of the armed forces to withdraw from the Republika Srpska – the '
            'Serb half of Bosnia – by surrounding its barracks with Serb '
            'troops. If the Serb separatists carried out their threat, more '
            'international peacekeepers would have to be sent in, Schmidt said '
            'in a report seen by the Guardian. Russia has threatened to block '
            'this week’s annual renewal of the peacekeepers’ mandate unless '

{'article': 'There’s a defining moment early in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Amélie '
            'when Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), a painfully shy and '
            'uncommonly adorable waitress at the Two Windmills cafe in '
            'Montmartre, arranges the return of childhood treasures to a '
            'middle-aged man who’d hidden them in her apartment building 40 '
            'years earlier. She has gone through an exhaustive search to find '
            'this man, meeting all manner of eccentric Parisians along the '
            'way, but she eventually summons the right person to a phone booth '
            'and watches the tears roll down his cheeks as this tin full of '
            'trinkets unleashes a flood of memories.\n'
            'As she glides blissfully through the frame, the narrator says, '
            '“Amélie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony. It’s a perfect '
            'moment. A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the '
            'city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.” '
            'Amélie is not really a film about love, as much as its heroine '
            'does to manufacture it for others — and finally, winsomely, for '
            'herself. And Amélie is not really a film about altruism, either, '
            'given how much time she spends tormenting the nasty greengrocer '
            '(Urbain Cancelier) who abuses his sweet, simple-minded assistant '
            '(Jamel Debbouze). It’s really a film about perfection, a fantasy '
            'about how a messy world can, through force of will and timing and '
            'deftness of touch, be harmonized down to the second. There’s a '
            'mechanical quality to the film that’s completely at odds with the '
            'spontaneity and surprise of authentic passion. That “strange '
            'feeling of absolute harmony” is the metronomic ticking that '
            'Jeunet manufactures here – satisfying perhaps, but in no way '
            'romantic. Yet 20 years later, Amélie does feel like an important '
            'shift in film-making style, a natural bookend to Moulin Rouge '
            'earlier in the year. The medium was entering an era of extreme '
            'plasticity, where the world could be bended and refined down to '
            'the pixel, and engineered to achieve moments of pristine, '
            'storyboarded flawlessness. There’s quite literally not a hair out '
            'of place in Amélie – Audrey Tautou’s immaculate bob is the '
            'greatest achievement in French hairdressing since Anna Karina’s '
            'bangs in Vivre Sa Vie – but the cold order of the film should not '
            'be mistaken for swooning romanticism.\n'
            'Amélie also recalls a classic Onion headline that predates it by '
            'two years: Romantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested. '
            'Among the details in the restraining order against this man is '
            'that he’d stalked a woman for two months, spied on her and tapped '
            'her phone, and “tricked her into boarding Caribbean-bound jets”. '
            'Amélie may have a more delicate touch and a timidness that '
            'relegates her to the sidelines of her own life, but the film '
            'celebrates a quirkiness that’s millimeters away from derangement, '
            'as she makes elaborate interventions on people’s lives and teases '
            'the man she desires with Rube Goldberg contraptions that don’t '
            'pay off until she’s ready. To a degree, Jeunet’s Paris doesn’t '
            'need Amélie to syncopate to a pleasing rhythm, as he delights in '
            'the random, unrelated events around the fertilization that led to '
            'her birth nine months later. Raised as an only child whose sole '
            'friend is a “suicidal fish” that leaps out of its bowl, Amélie '
            'grows into a passive, self-effacing adult who comes to realize '
            'that she can shape the destinies of those around her without '
            'making herself visible. And so, she returns those childhood '
            'trinkets to the middle-aged man. And she persuades the '
            'hypochondriac cashier (Isabelle Nanty) at the cafe to take notice '
            'of the regular (Jeunet favorite Dominique Pinon) who always sits '
            'across from her station. And she honors her father’s dreams of '
            'world travel by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight '
            'attendant send back Polaroids of the gnome at various landmarks. '
            'And she gets a key to the mean grocer’s apartment and messes with '
            'his head by switching his toothpaste with foot cream or swapping '
            'out his slippers for a pair a few sizes too small.\n'
            'And on and on and on. Amélie inevitably takes an interest in '
            'arranging happiness for herself when she spots a handsome young '
            'man named Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has made a hobby out of '
            'collecting discarded shots from under photo booth machines. Their '
            'courtship is all gestures and delayed gratification, all so '
            'beautifully staged that the audience is never invited to imagine '
            'what a real relationship between the two of them might be like. '
            'It is the ultimate romantic comedy in that respect, imagining '
            'nothing worse than a series of contrived obstacles keeping two '
            'people from a future of uncomplicated bliss. It’s an extremely '
            'seductive fantasy for many, buoyed by the undeniable brio of '
            'Jeunet’s film-making. The difference is that Jeunet’s previous '
            'fantasies with co-director Marc Caro, the 1991 black comedy '
            'Delicatessen and the surrealist 1995 science-fiction City of Lost '
            'Children, have a much darker tone to bring them back down to '
            'earth. There’s no doubt that Jeunet succeeds in turning this '
            'hidden corner of Montmartre, relegated mostly to the denizens of '
            'an apartment building and a cafe, into a community of oddballs '
            'bound closely together by dazzling orchestration. The experience '
            'intends to be a sustained magic act, but it’s more often sickly '
            'sweet. As Amélie, Tautou does well to suggest the loneliness and '
            'fear at the core of her character while still inviting the '
            'audience to play co-conspirator to her behind-the-scenes '
            'machinations. But Jeunet doesn’t appreciate her human dimension, '
            'to say nothing of the other characters, who are defined by silly '
            'likes and dislikes and weird patterns of behavior, but feel '
            'similarly trapped in his grand design. It’s hard not to feel '
            'manipulated by Jeunet in the same elfin way his heroine '
            'intervenes in people’s lives. The intent may be benevolent, but '
            'you’re still getting jerked around.',

{'article': 'This morning, at the all-important Cop26 climate conference in '
            'Glasgow, the prime minister is urging world leaders to commit to '
            'take radical action to reverse the catastrophic degradation of '
            'the world’s forests. It is hard to exaggerate the importance of '
            'what he is asking. Put simply, there is no credible response to '
            'the climate crisis – or to so many of the biggest challenges we '
            'face – that does not involve protecting and restoring nature on a '
            'massive scale. That shouldn’t need saying, but modern industrial '
            'society is only just beginning to comprehend, let alone '
            'internalise, what indigenous peoples have always known: our lives '
            'and economies, our cultures and identities, are indivisibly '
            'connected with the natural world. Globally, nature-based '
            'solutions such as forests, mangroves and peatlands could provide '
            'about a third of the most effective and cost-effective solutions '
            'to the climate crisis that we need now – as well as helping '
            'communities adapt to the changes that are now inevitable. But '
            'currently, they attract just 3% of total global climate finance. '
            'That makes no sense at all. If we were to lose any of the world’s '
            'great forests, we would have zero chance of stabilising the '
            'world’s climate, of staying within 1.5C of warming, of reversing '
            'the catastrophic loss of wildlife. And the damage we are doing is '
            'catastrophic. We lose about 30 football pitches of forest every '
            'single minute, destroying complex natural systems that sustain '
            'hundreds of millions of people. But the flipside is that by '
            'scaling up our efforts to protect and restore nature, we are not '
            'only tackling the climate emergency, but poverty, extinctions, '
            'even pandemics. That’s why, as holders of the Cop26 presidency, '
            'we have put nature at the heart of our response to the climate '
            'crisis, and why Boris Johnson is demanding action today. The UK '
            'has built a coalition of countries all committed to ending '
            'deforestation by the end of this decade. More than 100 countries '
            'have signed our Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land '
            'use, representing 85% of the world’s forests – that’s an area of '
            'more than 13m sq miles. On their own, such declarations are not '
            'enough, but we have also mobilised unprecedented finance '
            'commitments – $19.2bn, including $12bn from governments, for our '
            'global forest finance pledge, at least $7.2bn of private '
            'investment and billions of dollars from philanthropists. As part '
            'of that, we have formed an alliance between donor countries and '
            'the long-overlooked Congo basin – with at least $1.5bn pledged '
            'for this biodiversity jewel that is the second largest tropical '
            'forest in the world. And we have pressed the big multilateral '
            'development banks, including the World Bank, to commit not only '
            'to aligning their policies with the Paris goals, but to '
            'reconciling their entire portfolios with nature. It is right to '
            'insist that the public money we invest through them should '
            'support the public good, not undermine it. Currently, incentives '
            'in favour of destroying forests outstrip incentives to protect '
            'them by 40 to 1. So we are using every lever we have to increase '
            'investment from all sources – public, private and philanthropic – '
            'to shift those incentives towards renewal. We have secured a '
            'public commitment from the world’s biggest buyers of commodities '
            'that they will stop buying produce that has been grown on '
            'deforested land. So even countries that have been unwilling to '
            'address deforestation will struggle to ignore the signal this '
            'sends them. And because commodity production is responsible for '
            'the overwhelming majority of deforestation, we have assembled 28 '
            'key producer and consumer countries representing three-quarters '
            'of global trade in products such as palm oil, soya, cocoa, beef '
            'and timber to commit to breaking the link between agricultural '
            'commodity supply chains and deforestation – as we are doing '
            'through legislation here in the UK.\n'
            'In addition, leading financial institutions, in charge of about '
            '$8.7tn of assets, will commit publicly to eliminate '
            'commodity-driven deforestation from their portfolios, to support '
            'the shift towards the sustainable production of agricultural '
            'commodities and, crucially, to disclose fully the progress they '
            'make. We are rallying donors to invest in high-integrity carbon '
            'markets so we can recognise and reward those countries that are '
            'keeping their forests intact, as well as helping others to move '
            'from deforestation towards renewal – with $1bn and counting '
            'secured through a new programme called Leaf. Finally, if we want '
            'to protect and restore nature at scale, we need to back the '
            'indigenous communities that have defended their forest homes for '
            'generations, without meaningful support or recognition and often '
            'in the face of chronic danger. Indigenous people’s lands are home '
            'to more than a third of the world’s intact forest landscapes and '
            'almost a quarter of the carbon stored in the world’s tropical '
            'forests. And today, we have secured $1.7bn to help those '
            'communities secure tenure of the land that is by rights already '
            'theirs. Of course, we know well that promises are only valuable '
            'in so far as they are honoured, and that the gap between where we '
            'are now and where we need to be by the end of this decade is '
            'vast. So in the weeks, months and years ahead, the UK will do '
            'everything we can to maintain momentum, inject real '
            'accountability and catalyse action. But combined, the commitments '
            'to protect the world’s forests made at Cop26 in Glasgow today go '
            'far, far beyond anything we have seen before, and represent the '
            'turning point we urgently need for our forests, and by extension '
            'for our shared future. Zac Goldsmith is the UK’s international '

{'article': '‘I do sometimes feel like a cliche,” says Rich Jones. We’re in '
            'the cafe at his gym and he is in workout gear. It’s true, '
            'something about the language and the before and after pictures '
            'from his physical transformation – severely overweight to lean '
            'and chiselled – would appear familiar from thousands of adverts '
            'and magazine spreads, if it wasn’t for one thing; Jones got into '
            'the best shape of his adult life after he passed 50. “On 9 August '
            '2019, I walked in here. I was 54 and 127kg [20st].” He worked out '
            'at least six days a week, for 90 minutes or more at a time. “I '
            'immersed myself in everything, I did gym, I did classes, Pilates, '
            'I even did barre,” he says. Within eight or 10 weeks, he was able '
            'to stop taking painkillers for a shoulder injury. He now cycles '
            'and runs on top of his gym sessions. “It’s just a habit – I brush '
            'my teeth every day, I go for a run every day.” This new, dramatic '
            'fitness coupled with a weight loss programme (Jones lost 43kg '
            '(6st 11lb) in eight months) has been transformative in ways that '
            'don’t show in pictures. “I enjoy the feeling of being able to '
            'walk upstairs and not getting out of breath, of being fit and '
            'strong,” he says. The effect on his self-image was equally '
            'dramatic: “It changed how I think about myself. I didn’t realise '
            'how you feel about the world, how you interact with people, is so '
            'tied to your body image.” Now on the dating scene after a '
            'separation, he is bursting with new-found confidence. What '
            'combination of factors leads anyone to go all out at the gym, '
            'become a marathon runner or walk miles a day after the age of 50? '
            'Motivation is complex, and people differ, but the fact that '
            'mortality is nibbling at your heels, midlife restlessness has set '
            'in and with it the desire for reinvention, alongside a shift from '
            'active parenting or full-time work, may all contribute. '
            'Sometimes, a low-level unease gradually crystallises into a sense '
            'of urgency. “I had this sense that if I didn’t do something soon, '
            'it would be too late,” says Jones. Timing, he thinks, is key. '
            'Having retired early from his job as a chief information officer '
            'for a police force, the time was right. “I didn’t need to work, '
            'so I was my project – I was my work, really.” Not every super-fit '
            'person over 50 has a clear “push”. Mags Cook wasn’t particularly '
            'looking to lose weight or get fit. “I was always quite a busy '
            'person – I didn’t sit around too much,” she says. A retired '
            'teacher, Cook, 69, only started running properly at 59 when a '
            'friend encouraged her to try parkrun, the national weekly free '
            'fun run. “My husband died in 2006 and it was a good thing to know '
            'I’d be doing it every Saturday.” She enjoyed it, and her '
            'son-in-law suggested she join a running club. “I thought it was '
            'the most hilarious idea, because I was coming up to 60 and didn’t '
            'think of myself as a runner. But it was the best thing I’ve done '
            '– it was amazing.”\n'
            'Cook runs three or four times a week, and says: “Please don’t be '
            'too impressed, I don’t go fast or anything.” She is being modest '
            '– she has completed two marathons and a triathlon, for which she '
            'took swimming lessons to learn front crawl, and rode a bike for '
            'the first time since childhood. “I thought: ‘Might as well have a '
            'go,’” she says. The triathlon meant open-water swimming. “I '
            'cannot tell you how terrified I was … but, actually, after the '
            'swim I was completely elated that I’d done something I didn’t '
            'think could do.” While getting fit was not the end in itself for '
            'Cook, she can feel the difference now. “When I started running, I '
            'couldn’t do more than 50 metres without collapsing, but you '
            'discover you don’t have to run fast all the time – you can just '
            'keep going.” For Shashi Hussain, 53, staying sane rather than '
            'getting fit motivated her to start a walking regime in the first '
            'Covid-19 lockdown. “I’m quite sociable and being locked in my '
            'house, not being able to meet my friends and family, I found it '
            'really tough, so I decided to turn it into some sort of '
            'positive.” She began to walk daily, using the time to call '
            'friends and family to catch up. Gradually she went up from 5,000 '
            'steps to 10,000, “then 12,000, then 15,000; now I do anything '
            'between 20,000 and 30,000 steps a day”.\n'
            'It’s a significant time commitment: Hussain is an NHS manager, '
            'and splits her daily step count into a walk before work, one at '
            'lunchtime and more steps after work. She walks the streets and '
            'parks around her home in Essex, often combining exercise with '
            'errands, exploring new areas or taking photographs. “I’ve turned '
            'it into a bit of a learning exercise; I’ve learned so much about '
            'plants and flowers.” She has also lost weight, gone through two '
            'pairs of trainers and transformed her fitness. “My husband has '
            'always walked really fast. Before, I’d almost have to run to '
            'catch up with him, but he sees a difference in my breathing, my '
            'walking – I’m not out of breath.” For both women, the mental '
            'benefits have been crucial during the pandemic. Cook’s running '
            'club set members running tasks during lockdown: “They kept us '
            'going, it was brilliant. It really made lockdown so different.” '
            '“For my mental wellbeing, it’s been the best thing ever,” says '
            'Hussain, who has surprised herself with her unwavering '
            'commitment. It’s almost a compulsion: if her step count is lower '
            'at weekends, she sometimes goes back out when her husband is '
            'asleep. “It has become part of my life.” For Cook: “It has made '
            'me braver, I think.” While Cook, Jones and Hussain may be in the '
            'best shape of their lives, the same is not true of everyone in '
            'their age group: 42% of over-55s are inactive, compared with 29% '
            'of UK adults, according to Sport England research. Perhaps that '
            'is not surprising, when the fitness industry often appears to be '
            'tailored to the young. Chris Zaremba is very aware of that. '
            'Another convert to super-fitness after 50, he is a personal '
            'trainer who specialises in the over-50s. He coined the term '
            '“gymtimidation” to describe how many older people feel about '
            'fitness clubs. “A new gym opens in your town and, guess what, '
            'they are playing loud music, there are loads of mirrors and '
            'industrial grungy design – it’s not welcoming for anybody over '
            '40, which is really stupid.” Jones agrees: “You think they’re '
            'judging you.” He tried and disliked other gyms (“just a room with '
            'kit and pumping music”) before finding a small, supportive one. '
            'At 50, Zaremba himself was “allergic to exercise” and very '
            'overweight; his first experiences in the gym were typically '
            'off-putting. “Everyone there was already several times fitter '
            'than I was,” he says. But he conquered his misgivings in '
            'spectacular style: he has run marathons and a triathlon, and in '
            '2014 won the world championships in both fitness and muscle '
            'modelling (similar to bodybuilding). His recent book, Fat to Fit '
            'at Fifty, describes his journey and provides training tips. '
            'Getting fit after 50 is an optimistic act; a positive statement '
            'of intent for the second half of your life. “I hear time and time '
            'again: ‘It’s too late for me to start,’” says Zaremba. “I say, '
            'no, it’s not. I did not exercise at all when I was 50 and by the '
            'time I was 55, I was one of the healthiest 55-year-olds on the '
            'planet.” Most of his clients have gentler aspirations. “It’s '
            'about maintaining independent living for longer; being mobile, '
            'living a happy, independent life.” Is there a risk that '
            'extraordinary stories such as Zaremba’s might discourage rather '
            'than inspire? “Headlines like: ‘Anyone can run a marathon’ are '
            'not fair because it’s not actually true,” says Dr Lucy Pollock, a '
            'consultant in geriatric medicine and author of The Book About '
            'Getting Older (For People Who Don’t Want to Talk About It). But '
            'getting fit after 50 need not mean becoming a ropey-calved '
            'cycling obsessive in Lycra or signing up for the Marathon des '
            'Sables. “I think depictions of older people getting fitter fall '
            'into two camps,” says Kate Dale of Sport England; its Active '
            'Ageing campaign funds projects that target inactivity in older '
            'people. “It’s either chairobics stuff or you’ve got marathon '
            'runners, like the Skipping Sikh. He’s amazing, but you don’t have '
            'to go to one of those extremes, you can find what’s right for '
            'you.” This is vital because, as Pollock’s book highlights, '
            'research shows that activity can improve longevity and, '
            'crucially, quality of life for older people, including the group '
            'she describes as the “super old”. One of the best parts of her '
            'job, Pollock says, is seeing someone very fragile, with poor '
            'mobility, regain strength and the ability to move independently. '
            '“It’s amazing how quickly small amounts of exercise make a '
            'difference. There are lots of people who are never going to be '
            'able to do a squat again – that doesn’t mean they can’t do '
            'anything.” Brian Nathan can’t do a full plié (pretty close to a '
            'squat, but much more elegant), but at 82, he goes down on one leg '
            'at a time at his Silver Swans class, a Royal Academy of Dance '
            'initiative for over-55 ballet beginners and returners. Nathan '
            'started three years ago. “I thought: ‘I’ve got to exercise’, but '
            'I loathe exercise and hate ploughing up and down a swimming pool, '
            'so what is there in the dancing world?” He finds it “impossibly '
            'difficult”, but says: “What is marvellous about the teachers of '
            'Silver Swans is that they understand we are old and don’t make us '
            'relentlessly go on and on.”\n'
            'An accomplished ballroom dancer in his youth (“I discovered girls '
            'love dancing so it was simple: become a decent dancer”), Nathan '
            'also played cricket and rugby. But with six children and a '
            'successful tool-and-equipment hire business, “it petered out”. '
            'Now, though, his weekly regime puts mine to shame. “On Monday, I '
            'do old gits cricket and old gits tennis – it’s brilliant. '
            'Tuesday, I have a rest, Wednesday, I do Move to the Musicals '
            '(another Royal Academy dance class), Thursdays I rest again and '
            'Fridays I do ballet.” Nathan says he has improved. “I’m motivated '
            'to try and get better because I love trying to be graceful to '
            'music – and totally failing; I still want to try every week. We '
            'were walking this morning, and walking as a ballet dancer walks '
            'is hard. I can remember trying to do it three years ago and I '
            'couldn’t; I thought good God, I’m better at it. I can see the '
            'point, you know.” There are as many ways to get moving, and what '
            'works will depend on individual circumstances and health, '
            'resources, time and inclination. “It’s about forgiving yourself '
            'to some degree,” says Pollock. “Accepting your limits and working '
            'within them.” For those who are ready to take on a challenge, '
            'Zaremba recommends trying to incorporate some resistance work as '
            'well as an activity that raises the heart rate (he is another '
            'parkrun fan). It’s important, he says, to try and fight '
            'sarcopenia, the process of losing skeletal muscle mass as we age '
            '(Pollock also recommends light weights, perhaps using a tin of '
            'beans). Flexibility, mobility and coordination work can also be '
            'improved hugely in later life and have day-to-day benefits, in '
            'staying agile and preventing falls. This can be quite modest: '
            'Zaremba recommends doorframe stretches as a good simple starter. '
            'However gentle your exercise regime, advises Pollock, give '
            'yourself credit as you improve. “Notice that you’re better at it '
            'this week than last week. Give yourself a pat on the back and '
            'notice how far you have come in a very short time.” As an '
            'additional bonus, the fitness efforts of people over 50 seem to '
            'have a powerful trickle-down effect on friends and family. Cook '
            'has converted several friends to running and runs with her '
            'daughter; Hussain has inspired her friends. “A lot of people have '
            'started doing it with me, which is brilliant.” Even her mother, '
            'who is 76, now walks 10,000 to 15,000 steps a day. “She says I’ve '
            'really helped her because otherwise, she’d have nothing to do.” '
            '“I wouldn’t call myself a role model in any way,” says Jones, '
            '“But both my boys in their early 20s now take better care of '
            'themselves. I think there has been a kind of shared awakening.”',

            'editing perfections, computer-generated backgrounds, extra lines '
            'of dialogue – and the instruction: “Hide pregnancy bump.” This '
            'related to the increasing evidence of Freddie, now four weeks '
            'old, and sleeping between feeds in a pub garden near the London '
            'home of his mother, Gemma Whelan, who is amused to hear of this '
            'prenatal technology. “Wow!” she says. ‘“How are they going to do '
            'that? Paint it out? Or cut in a waistline from earlier?” Despite '
            'high-level acting credits – including Yara Greyjoy in Game of '
            'Thrones and Kate in BBC Two’s Upstart Crow – the 40-year-old says '
            'she is never recognised in the street: “People sometimes say, ‘Do '
            'I know you from the bus stop?’ or, ‘Were we at school?’ That’s it '
            'really.” Whelan enjoys her ability to transform into her her '
            'characters, whether with Yara’s breastplate, war paint and mouthy '
            'scowl – “it would be almost insulting to be recognised from Game '
            'of Thrones” – or, in BBC One’s The Moorside, as Karen Matthews, '
            'the Yorkshire woman jailed for faking the abduction of her '
            'daughter, so physically transformed that it fooled Whelan’s mum. '
            '“She said: ‘Strange they used so much original footage of her!’, '
            'and I said: ‘That’s all me, Mum. There is no original footage.’”\n'
            'Whelan is taking minimal maternity leave partly because she is '
            'self-employed but also because, like most actors, she endured a '
            'year during lockdown of not doing very much. A West End version '
            'of Upstart Crow was shut down three weeks into the run, after '
            'which she spent “a year doing audiobooks and voiceovers”. She '
            'then filmed next year’s second series of BBC One’s Gentleman Jack '
            '– playing Marian, the sister of Anne Lister – before The Tower. '
            'The main shoot lasted through the second trimester. With actors '
            'who are visibly pregnant when their characters are not, the '
            'convention has been to shoot them mainly from the neck up. “Yeah. '
            'It’s a great way of getting loads of closeups!” laughs Whelan '
            'who, during the final season of Game of Thrones, was carrying '
            'Frances, now four. “But there also were a lot of wide shots in '
            'The Tower. I think you’d only notice if you knew I was pregnant '
            'and, if you do notice, women have babies, who cares? It was '
            'refreshing to be able to not worry about it.”\n'
            'Whelan’s domestic juggling starkly contrasts with DS Sarah '
            'Collins in The Tower, who has no visible private life. “She’s '
            'very moral, very black and white. There’s very little nuance in '
            'her judgment.” Viewers may be reminded of Adrian Dunbar’s Supt '
            'Ted Hastings in Line of Duty, and Whelan admits the similarity: '
            '“Absolutely. They swore an oath to keep the law and so they do. '
            'She doesn’t care about being a people-pleaser, which I think a '
            'lot of women are written as – and, actually, a lot of women are – '
            'but I like that she’s very front-footed and doesn’t mind pissing '
            'people off.” Adapted by 24 screenwriter Patrick Harbinson, from a '
            'series of novels by former Met detective Kate London, The Tower '
            'goes out at a time when, after the murder by a serving police '
            'officer of Sarah Everard, the reputation of the force is as low '
            'as it’s ever been. But, like Line of Duty, The Tower shows good '
            'and bad policing. “Yes. Exactly,” says Whelan. “Most of the cops '
            'are trying to do their best, but some aren’t; there are wrong '
            '’uns.” As with all current TV productions, The Tower had a '
            'Covid-safe set, with testing mandatory and jabs encouraged – a '
            'difficult decision for Whelan at a time when medical evidence on '
            'safety during pregnancy was sketchy. Stressing that she is not '
            'telling others what to do but sharing her own thought processes '
            'in a dilemma that many face, she says: “I’m double-vaxxed, and '
            'had both while I was pregnant. I spoke to the midwife and doctors '
            'at length, and read all the stories about the huge number of '
            'American pregnant women who had been jabbed without incident. And '
            'I knew if I got Covid in the third trimester it could be very '
            'serious. It’s not an easy decision but I felt comfortable to make '
            'it and we’re both fine.”\n'
            'Another question of film-set safety has arisen since the '
            'revelations about Harvey Weinstein and other showbiz predators. '
            'Whelan says that she has never experienced any threats or '
            'assaults, but the mood of shoots has noticeably changed. “There’s '
            'a very different choice of language now. If anyone makes an '
            'innuendo, everyone shuts down. I think, five or 10 years ago, if '
            'there was a double entendre, everyone would jump on the bandwagon '
            'and see how many laughs they could raise. I remember when an '
            'actor would have a microphone fitted, and sometimes you have to '
            'root around the waist. And, in the past, there’d be all this, '
            '‘and while you’re down there, hur, hur!’ But now you don’t have '
            'to play along with things like that.” In the past, it was common '
            'for actors, saying hello or goodbye to colleagues, to exchange '
            'embraces of a level some married couples never reach. But first '
            '#MeToo and then Covid-19 have ended that. “All the '
            'squishy-squishy, huggy-huggy stuff has stopped. But I don’t miss '
            'it. You have to be a bit more genuine now if you’re saying hello. '
            'You can’t hide behind a big hug. And there’s no question mark '
            'over it: Do we double kiss? Do we hug? Clasp hands? No, we just '
            'say hello to each other.” Although DS Collins’s workaholism '
            'prevents her having sex in The Tower, an intimacy director is '
            'credited for couples who do. Presumably, when Whelan was playing '
            'the energetically bisexual Yara in Game of Thrones, actors were '
            'just left to get on with it? “Almost literally. They used to just '
            'say, ‘When we shout action, go for it!’, and it could be a sort '
            'of frenzied mess. But between the actors there was always an '
            'instinct to check in with each other. There was a scene in a '
            'brothel with a woman and she was so exposed that we talked '
            'together about where the camera would be and what she was happy '
            'with. A director might say, ‘Bit of boob biting, then slap her '
            'bum and go!’, but I’d always talk it through with the other '
            'actor.”\n'
            'In the 2012 second season (her first) of Game of Thrones, Yara '
            'and Theon (Alfie Allen) had one of TV’s most talked-about '
            'sex-scenes (retrospectively revealed to be incestuous) sharing a '
            'horse-ride including a reach-round move that would bring '
            'immediate disqualification in dressage. “Alfie was very much, ‘Is '
            'this OK? How are we going to make this work?’ With intimacy '
            'directors, it’s choreography – you move there, I move there, and '
            'permission and consent is given before you start. It is a step in '
            'the right direction.” With Yara, Shakespeare’s Kate, and now DS '
            'Collins, Whelan has repeatedly played spectacularly strong women. '
            '“That seems to be what casting directors see in me.” Possibly '
            'because there is something sharp and sardonic about her? “Maybe. '
            'I think I may give off a ‘don’t fuck with me’ vibe. There’s '
            'definitely a defiance.” And has that always been there? “My mum '
            'says I’ve always been astonishingly wilful and stubborn. But it '
            'seems to come out more in the acting. In real life, I’m quite '
            'apologetic, ‘I’m so sorry to take up your time, thank you so much '
            'for getting me a tea,’ and so on. But, in my work, I feel that’s '
            'where I belong and have a right to be there.”\n'
            'She may have inherited performing genes from parents who met in '
            'an amateur dramatics production of Eugene O’Neill’s Desire Under '
            'the Elms in Birmingham. Living there and in Leeds and London has '

{'article': 'Meta PCs, an Arizona-based company that sells computers, laptops '
            'and software for gamers was an unremarkable retail outfit a week '
            'ago. Then on Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his '
            'company would be changing its name to Meta and it found itself in '
            'an IP war with tech’s biggest behemoth. Lucky for Meta PCs, it’s '
            'already a few months ahead of Facebook in having the name '
            'trademarked. According to a document shared by TMZ, the company '
            'filed for its trademark in August, a little over a year after it '
            'was started. Zack Shutt, one of the founders of Meta PCs, told '
            'the Guardian that the company was registered in November of last '
            'year, and their team was unaware about Facebook’s plans to use '
            '“Meta” in any part of its rebranding until last week. Shutt, '
            'along with co-founder Joe Darger, told TMZ they won’t sell the '
            'name for less than $20m if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries to '
            'get the name. Shutt declined to further comment on this to the '
            'Guardian, citing legal concerns. Facebook did not respond to the '
            'Guardian’s request for comments, but someone affiliated with the '
            'company told TMZ that they are not too worried and they have the '
            'required rights to acquire the name. Mark P McKenna, a professor '
            'at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of '
            'Law, says even though Meta PCs has made an application to '
            'trademark its name, there are loopholes that may allow Facebook '
            'to acquire the name. One such measure is filing an application in '
            'another country and using that application date to file in the US '
            '– a practice often used by big companies. “They look for a little '
            'country without a searchable system and then file there,” he told '
            'the Guardian. “That would be a way for them to have an earlier '
            'date.” He added that trademark registration doesn’t define rights '
            'of a company in the US in this regard. “In the US, rights aren’t '
            'created by trademark registration – the rights arise out of use,” '
            'he said. So it remains to be seen how this tug of war will pan '
            'out, especially given Meta PCs would be up against a giant like '
            'Facebook. Schutt was unable to share information such as the '
            'value of the company, but said they’re a small organization with '
            'only 25 employees. “We’ve bootstrapped this company with our own '
            'personal funds. When we learned Facebook chose the same name, it '
            'was obviously a concern that we would lose whatever organic reach '
            'we had worked hard to build,” Shutt said, adding that they have '
            '“sizable investments” in branded content and influencer marketing '
            'in the works. Despite this looming concern, the company is '
            'finding fun ways to acknowledge the situation. On Thursday, Shutt '

{'article': 'Saving the world’s forests will be one of the cornerstone '
            'achievements of the Cop26 climate summit, the UK environment '
            'minister Zac Goldsmith has said, with some of the biggest '
            'forested nations and consumers of forestry products signing up to '
            'an “unprecedented” conservation deal. On Tuesday, more than 100 '
            'world leaders will commit to halting and reversing deforestation '
            'and land degradation by 2030, backed by nearly £14bn in public '
            'and private funding. Major producers and consumers of '
            'deforestation-linked commodities including Indonesia, China, '
            'Brazil and the US have put their name to the deal, which aims to '
            'curtail the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. '
            'Lord Goldsmith told the Guardian: “This is a genuinely '
            'unprecedented package. People will be able to justify having hope '
            '[that the world’s forests can be saved]. This puts us on a road '
            'to recovery and renewal.” He said it had “not been easy” to '
            'persuade many of the countries involved to join, as the deal '
            'requires not just a commitment to halt deforestation – which has '
            'never been achieved before, despite numerous failed attempts – '
            'and provide forested countries with funds to replace the money '
            'they would have made from exploiting forested land, but also to '
            'reforming aspects of commodity markets so that buyers cannot get '
            'away with importing commodities produced from deforested land. '
            '“The different parts of the package are mutually reinforcing,” '
            'said Goldsmith. “We are sending a very serious signal to the '
            'markets, we have a good pledge from buyers. The market has been '
            'blind to the value of the environment … The [current economic] '
            'incentives to deforest are 40 times bigger than the incentives to '
            'keep healthy forests, so changing that is difficult.”\n'
            'The line-up of countries includes China and Brazil, as well as '
            'smaller developing countries, and some big buyers of forestry '
            'products which will clean up their supply chains. “There are some '
            'surprising countries in there, and this is a pretty bullish '
            'pledge,” said the Conservative peer, though he declined to name '
            'any countries. “We have managed to persuade some of the trickier '
            'customers to come on board.” Goldsmith, son of the late '
            'billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, has long been a '
            'notable environmentalist, a former owner of the Ecologist '
            'magazine and a campaigner and philanthropist for conservation '
            'projects. His political career as an MP, which included a '
            'campaign running against Labour’s Sadiq Khan to be London mayor '
            'that was marred by accusations of Islamophobia, was ended by '
            'defeat in the 2019 election. Soon afterwards he was put in the '
            'Lords, controversially, by Boris Johnson. He was charged by '
            'Johnson, an old friend and fellow old Etonian, with what he said '
            'was a personal passion for protecting nature and combating the '
            'loss of species and habitats. “Putting nature at the heart [of '
            'the Cop] has been my obsession. It’s mad that nature has always '
            'been more or less forgotten [in climate negotiations],” said '
            'Goldsmith.\n'
            'The difficulty of achieving the broader deal hoped for at Cop26, '
            'of drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in line with '
            'scientific advice, was apparent on the first day of the summit, '
            'when more than 120 world leaders gathered in Glasgow. António '
            'Guterres, the UN secretary general, delivered a gloomy forecast '
            'of the prospects. “Recent climate action announcements might give '
            'the impression that we are on track to turn things around,” he '
            'said. “This is an illusion.” In this context, having a side deal '
            'on forestry in the bag is a major boost for the UK as hosts. '
            'However, some countries and analysts told the Guardian the '
            'agreement, while important, was flawed and lacking in some key '
            'respects, with too little cash being dedicated to helping poor '
            'countries preserve their forests, and too little emphasis on '
            'reducing demand for the commodities – such as soy, palm oil and '
            'beef – that drive deforestation in the first place. John Sauven, '
            'executive director of Greenpeace, said: “Everyone wants to see '
            'zero deforestation, not least the indigenous peoples whose homes '
            'and livelihoods are under threat. But without tackling the '
            'drivers of destruction it’s like whistling in the wind to think '
            'cash alone will work. Cattle and soya for animal feed are wiping '
            'out the Amazon and savannahs of Brazil. The industrial meat '
            'industry, like its counterpart in the fossil fuel sector, needs '
            'to come to an end.” He added: “Every climate scientist is saying '
            'we need to eat less meat. We won’t save the forests until '
            'politicians stop ignoring that message.” Indigenous leaders, who '
            'have been shown to be the best guardians of the natural world by '
            'several studies, have also said they were not consulted on the '
            'declaration, adding that many leaders making the commitment had a '
            'history of breaking promises on protecting indigenous rights. '
            'Goldsmith said the deal would benefit forest dwellers. '
            '“Indigenous people have always been seen as second tier [at '
            'Cops], they have never been given this support before,” he said. '
            '“I think for them this support will be a turning point at this '
            'Cop.” He added: “When you put it all together, it’s a robust '
            'package, trying to get as many major countries together as '
            'possible to commit to ending deforestation. But it’s worth '
            'nothing unless they back this up with policies. It will be our '
            'job to make this real.”',

{'article': 'Slipperiness is Scott Morrison’s defining characteristic. And it '
            'was never more on show than this week as he sold “the Australian '
            'Way” on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while being '
            'openly branded a liar by France over submarines. Take the stoush '
            'with Emmanuel Macron. When asked if Morrison had lied to him '
            'about dumping the $90bn Attack-class submarine contract, the '
            'French president said tartly: “I don’t think, I know.” Morrison '
            'denied it, before an instant pivot to a baseless claim about the '
            'journalists.\n'
            '“You were getting selfies with him.” No, we weren’t, said an '
            'indignant hack. “I must have been misinformed,” Morrison replied. '
            'All ridiculously trivial, but not quite innocent. When cornered, '
            'the Australian prime minister breaks the glass and reaches for '
            'distraction. Remember in March, when under pressure over the '
            'culture in parliament house, he suddenly turned on Sky News, '
            'warning about “glass houses”. “Right now, you would be aware that '
            'in your own organisation there is a person who had had a '
            'complaint made against them for harassment of a woman in a '
            'women’s toilet,” thundered Morrison. Not true, said Sky’s owners '
            'at News Corp. The prime minister issued a late night withdrawal. '
            '“The emotion of the moment is no excuse,” he said. Morrison’s '
            'next reactions to Macron were also interesting. “I have a lot of '
            'respect for your country,” Macron said, making plain he blamed '
            'Morrison specifically for what he contends was a lie. “A lot of '
            'respect and friendship for your people.”\n'
            'Morrison’s response was to defend Australia’s honour, citing his '
            'own “broad shoulders”. “I’m not going to cop sledging of '
            'Australia. I am not going to cop that on behalf of Australians.” '
            'Then, in an extraordinary breach of normal protocols, a personal '
            'text message from the French president was selectively leaked to '
            'the press. We now know that two days before the Aukus '
            'announcement, Macron texted Morrison to ask: “Should I expect '
            'good or bad news for our joint submarine ambitions?” This is '
            'being presented as evidence Macron knew the contract was about to '
            'be torn up. But Morrison’s fuller explanation subverts that '
            'reading. In mid-June, Morrison says he flew to Paris for dinner '
            'with Macron to state “candidly … that a conventional '
            'diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia’s '
            'strategic requirements”. But whatever he now says he said, what '
            'the French plainly heard was merely that there were problems with '
            'costs and delays. On Morrison’s own account, “the French defence '
            'system swung into full action”, sending an admiral to Australia '
            'to respond “to the issues that I had raised at our dinner”. Back '
            'then, Morrison publicly thanked the French president for “taking '
            'a very active role” in resolving the submarine issues. Morrison’s '
            'own account shows French actions consistent with a partner trying '
            'to fix issues, rather than one who had been told its services '
            'were no longer required. In essence, Morrison now says “they '
            'knew”. Macron says “he lied”. It appears the French knew less '
            'than they thought about Australia’s intentions, up to the virtual '
            'eve of the Aukus announcement. “I think it’s clear from president '
            'macron’s statements yesterday that the level of offence is still '
            'very great,” Morrison conceded in a moment of clarity in '
            'Glasgow.\n'
            'So Morrison slipped and slid through the French submarine '
            'contract until he was ready to announce his nuclear partnership '
            'with the US and UK. As he slipped and slid to the prime '
            'ministership in 2018, activating a tightly held plan to come '
            'through the pack. He out-energised Bill Shorten to claim victory '
            'in 2019, in part by convincing pensioners that Labor’s franking '
            'credit reforms would leave them worse off. The man who carried '
            'coal into parliament now has a net zero pamphlet that he believes '
            'can win back voters concerned about a warming planet. The '
            'electric vehicles which he claimed would destroy the Aussie '
            'weekend are now built into his emissions reduction goals. The man '
            'who said cutting emissions would destroy the economy now argues '
            'the opposite. As emissions have fallen by 20% since 2005, our '
            'economy has grown by 45%, he says, “proving that economic growth '
            'is not at odds with emissions reduction”. And we now have a new '
            'moral reason to export coal. We’re helping the world’s poor, he '
            'said in Rome. “Don’t force up the cost,” he begged. “That is only '
            'going to hurt the people who can afford it least.” If '
            'slipperiness defines him, it is also his primary political skill. '
            'Franklin D Roosevelt’s biographer Kenneth Davis says the former '
            'US president had little time for politicians “who pursued their '
            'objectives in uncompromisingly straight lines, men who '
            'disdain(ed) cajolery and concealment and misdirection”. As '
            'Turnbull, Dutton and now Macron can attest, those who have '
            'underestimated Morrison have been left clawing at the open air. '
            'Less chameleon than oiled seal, he has already slipped them by.',

{'article': 'The rowan trees opposite my office are now devoid of either leaf '
            'or fruit, but from August until recently they have been centres '
            'of intense activity for jackdaws, rooks, carrion crows and even '
            'magpies. The birds crowded the tops or chased each other through '
            'the foliage while they feasted daily on the red fruits. I had '
            'never previously noticed the connection between rowan berries and '
            'corvids. These observations, in turn, helped me to understand an '
            'older puzzle, because on the slopes along the high moorland edge, '
            'the ground had been sown with 30 young rowans. I’d previously '
            'credited this habitat creation to another tree-planting group, '
            'the thrushes. In their wonderful book Birds and Berries, Barbara '
            'and David Snow suggest that blackbirds were the chief consumers '
            'and propagators of rowans in their Hertfordshire study area. '
            'Here, however, it’s a far less beloved black bird that is the '
            'creative force. A third piece in the ecological jigsaw was a '
            'fragment of Aberdeenshire dialect once recounted to me by a '
            'farmer near Turiff. Saplings that spring up mysteriously in that '
            'area are known as “craa-sown”. Now I understand it. Once you are '
            'attuned to the rowan-planting efforts of these often despised '
            'black creatures, you realise how much we owe them. It turns out '
            'that hawthorns are equally popular with members of the crow '
            'family, and often the only native trees growing in the infertile '
            'soils of the High Peak are these two fruit-bearing bushes. The '
            'other name for rowan is mountain ash, and of all trees it is the '
            'one most tolerant of high, wind-swept places. It is the crows '
            'that we should thank partly for the colour, complexity and '
            'texture in parts of our upland landscape. Without them some areas '
            'of Derbyshire would almost certainly have no trees at all. If '
            'there had previously been doubt about who had sown the 30 young '
            'rowans, I am rather more certain about who chopped them down. '
            'Last spring it appears someone from a nearby driven-grouse moor '
            'took a chainsaw to them and felled the lot. I’m now putting my '
            'money on crows as the truer custodians of this landscape. • '

{'article': 'On a late May day in 1996, the singer Eva Cassidy and her '
            'bandmate Chris Biondo drove to a remote factory in rural Virginia '
            'to collect copies of the recording that turned out to be the last '
            'she would ever make. “We picked up a total of about 1,100 '
            'cassettes and CDs,” Biondo recalled. “When we got in the car, Eva '
            'cracked open a box and started getting very worried. She felt she '
            'wasn’t going to be able to sell them all. I’ll never forget her '
            'comment: ‘When I’m dead and they find me, there’s going to be '
            'boxes of these in my basement,’ she said. Her expectations for '
            'the record could not have been more minimal.”\n'
            'After all, Cassidy had been performing for nearly a decade by '
            'then in relative obscurity and, while she had a number of '
            'meetings with record company executives in that time, they never '
            'went beyond the talking stage. Worse, by the summer of 96, the '
            '33-year-old was facing something dire. Over the course of the '
            'next few months, she would receive increasingly grim diagnoses of '
            'a cancer that had already begun to make quickening race through '
            'her body, robbing her of any chance of making a mark during her '
            'time on earth. Given that, who could have foreseen that Cassidy’s '
            'music would one day generate a sustained catalogue that would '
            'sell in the multi-millions, creating chart hits all over the '
            'world? “At the time, we just hoped to make enough money to buy a '
            'PA system,” Biondo said. This week will mark 25 years since '
            'Cassidy died of melanoma cancer, just 10 months after recording '
            'the live album she and Biondo had driven out to pick up that day. '
            'The story that emerged later – of a talent barely recognized in '
            'her lifetime, who went on to achieve rapturous posthumous acclaim '
            '– has become one of the most dramatic bad news/good news tales in '
            'pop history. But it never would have happened without the '
            'stalwart efforts of some dedicated supporters, as well as several '
            'connections that brought her songs to the attention of more media '
            'gatekeepers than normally receive credit in the tale. The small '
            'label that set things in motion, Blix Street Records, seemed an '
            'unlikely engine to power such a success. Before making a deal '
            'with Eva’s estate, the imprint had achieved modest sales with '
            'recordings by jazz instrumental bands and Celtic singers, the '
            'best-selling of whom was Mary Black. It was another singer on the '
            'label, Grace Griffith, a friend of Cassidy’s from the Washington '
            'DC club scene, who introduced her music to Blix Street chief Bill '
            'Straw. “We have this wonderful nightingale,’” Griffith told him, '
            'Straw recalled. “I’m afraid we’re going to lose her.”\n'
            '“As soon as her vocal came on, I felt it was extraordinary,” he '
            'said. “By the time I finished the album, I came to the conclusion '
            'that this was one of the best singers ever.” Though many have '
            'come to similar conclusions since, Biondo was one of the first to '
            'do so. He met Cassidy in the winter of 1986 when, on the '
            'recommendation of a mutual friend, she came to visit him at his '
            'small home recording studio. “She was afraid to come inside '
            'because she had not done any recording like this before,” Biondo '
            'said. Once she began to sing, however, he was instantly taken '
            'with her natural skill. “A lot of people take lessons to learn '
            'music theory and how to do harmonies,” he said. “She could just '
            'do it. I watched her come up with three- or four-part harmonies '
            'out of nowhere. She would hear it in her head and then sing '
            'anything she heard.” Biondo believes that skill is what freed her '
            'to bring so much emotion to the songs. “There are a lot of '
            'components to someone trying to pull off a tune,” he said. “They '
            'have to think about the technical parts, about what the next note '
            'is and what the phrasing will be. But because those things were '
            'so natural to Eva, it allowed her to go right to the next level, '
            'which was to go inside the song and feel the lyrics.” Her skill '
            'also meant she could improvise the tunes at will, as well as bend '
            'the notes with a sculptor’s care. “She could change the melody to '
            'something the band had not heard before on a gig-by-gig basis,” '
            'Biondo said. Then there was the sheer sound of her soprano, '
            'graced by a tone as plush as fleece. “It’s the purity of the tone '
            'that struck me,” said Rob Burley, who wrote the book Songbird, '
            'about Cassidy’s life. “The unadorned quality of it shines '
            'through.”\n'
            'At times, however, the subtlety of her approach, and the quiet '
            'intensity of it, could fly over the heads of some audiences. “We '
            'never played loud which was a problem for us,” Biondo said. “One '
            'time, we played this club in southern Maryland and we were doing '
            'ballads, country tunes and the clientele was into Lynyrd Skynyrd, '
            'so people were leaving. The guy who had hired us to play said, '
            '‘How about I pay you and you guys go home?’ It’s never a good '
            'thing when someone pays you to leave.” On the other hand, Biondo '
            'said Cassidy “thought that was kinda cool,” an attitude that '
            'underscores her focus on the performance rather than its '
            'reception. “She just liked to go out and sing,” he said. “She '
            'didn’t want anybody to jump up and down.” Cassidy remained '
            'equally cool when it came to meetings with record companies. '
            '“Maybe half a dozen companies came down to talk to her,” Biondo '
            'said. “But she never did the kinds of things the people who think '
            'they’re going to get a contract do, which is to act all giddy and '
            'make fast friends with the A&R people. I don’t think they were '
            'too impressed with her enthusiasm level.” Cassidy’s low-key '
            'response had two sources: her introverted character, and her '
            'concern that the industry might try to squeeze her omnivorous '
            'musical taste into a box. When one company executive asked '
            'Cassidy what kind of music she wanted to record, she told him, '
            '“anything but that pop crap,” Burley said. When the prestigious '
            'Blue Note Records gave Cassidy’s band a budget of $3,500 to cut '
            'six songs, she covered six different genres. “You could see that '
            'the business sense and who the artist is was going to collide,” '
            'Biondo said. At one point, Blue Note tried pairing her with a '
            'smooth jazz band on the label, Pieces of a Dream, for a few songs '
            'but the singer despised the result. A more pleasing proposal came '
            'from Apollo Records, run by civil rights activist Percy Sutton, a '
            'label connected to the vaunted Harlem-based theater. “They sent '
            'her a contract which meant she could have quit her day job (in a '
            'plant nursery) and gotten a yearly salary,” Biondi said. “That '
            'was a dream come true.” Unfortunately, before Cassidy could sign, '
            'the company folded. That’s the whole reason Cassidy and her band '
            'cut the Live at Blues Alley album. It was essentially a hail-Mary '
            'pass to get attention and earn some badly needed cash. Sadly, '
            'around the same time a mysterious mole on Cassidy’s back began to '
            'raise concerns. Because she hadn’t seen a doctor in years, Biondo '
            'insisted she go to his. But she delayed for six months. When she '
            'finally went, it instigated a procedure that became far more '
            'invasive that was first assumed. The doctor had to take the skin '
            'from the back of her neck all the way down her spine in a '
            'three-inch-wide swath. While the surgeon thought he caught all '
            'the cancer, it came back with a vengeance. “It was bad news after '
            'bad news,” Biondo said. “She had cancer in her lungs, her brain, '
            'her arm, her back.”\n'
            'Several months of heavy chemotherapy followed, to no avail. In '
            'her dying days, Cassidy’s music was brought once again to various '
            'labels. And they still turned her down. “The thing that pisses me '
            'off is that there wasn’t anybody smart enough to realize what was '
            'there,” said Biondo. “When they heard Eva, they should have '
            'known.” Bill Straw had heard Cassidy’s music by then; he was '
            'invited by Griffith to meet her at a benefit held for the singer '
            'two months before her death. But he felt it would be ghoulish for '
            'him to attend. Six months after she died, however, he met with '
            'her parents. Straw had the advantage of understanding the kind of '
            'specialized audience he assumed she could reach at that point. It '
            'helped that there were no other serious bidders. Though Cassidy '
            'had self-released just three albums in her lifetime – including a '
            'collaboration with DC go-go pioneer Chuck Brown, a solo work, and '
            'the live Blues Alley album – she had some 127 recordings in the '
            'can. From that deep trove, Blix Street fashioned an ideal set '
            'titled Songbird, which they issued in 1998. A myth has arisen '
            'that the album sold nothing until it was picked up by BBC Radio 2 '
            'two years later, but, according to Straw, the American press '
            'jumped on it quickly, with rave reviews in publications as '
            'mainstream as People magazine. Once the label convinced a Boston '
            'radio station to play her music, “we sold 10,000 CDs in that city '
            'in two weeks. We kept having these little explosions,” Straw '
            'said. The Mount Vesuvius moment, however, came when Blix Street’s '
            'associated label in the UK, Hot Records, hired Tony Bramwell, a '
            'record promo guy from the 60s who had worked with the Beatles, to '
            'promote the music. He took it to the producer of Terry Wogan’s '
            'huge morning show on Radio 2. “They listened because of Tony '
            'Bramwell’s lineage,” Burley said. The result instantly resonated '
            'with British listeners, generating snowballing sales. Just before '
            'Christmas 2000, after Top of the Pops 2 played a blurry video of '
            'Cassidy singing Over the Rainbow, the album soared to the top of '
            'the UK chart.\n'
            'In the years since, the demand for her music has encouraged the '
            'release of no fewer than 12 subsequent albums, consisting of '
            'either previously unheard or repackaged performances. This '
            'December will see the release of yet another – a 25th anniversary '
            'edition of Live at Blues Alley. Biondo, who is credited as '
            'producer on most of her recordings, doesn’t believe that all of '
            'that music deserves to be heard. “I don’t think Eva would want it '
            'all out,” he said. “She didn’t get the chance to censor her own '
            'stuff and I don’t think that’s fair, especially since she had '
            'such strong feelings about people not hearing her at her best.” '
            'Even Straw believes one release shouldn’t have happened – the '
            'Wonderful World set from 2004. Still, he said, pressure from the '
            'public dictated that release. As to what Cassidy herself would '
            'have made of the sheer scale of the attention she has received, '
            'Biondo said, “she would have been scared shitless.” He believes '
            'she would have preferred a more measured, and controllable, '
            'degree of attention. “I have this day dream about Eva every once '
            'in a while,” Biondo mused. “In the dream, she isn’t dead and '
            'she’s as loved as she is now. I see her singing in this little '
            'restaurant that’s behind my house. Maybe 40 people can fit in '
            'there and she plays there every night and people pay a lot of '
            'money to see her. And they’re quiet and they really listen. To '
            'her, that would be heaven.”',

{'article': 'The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, made no effort to '
            'assess the impact on global heating of handing $21m to Empire '
            'Energy to frack the Beetaloo Basin, despite evidence that '
            'exploiting the region’s gas would drive up Australia’s emissions '
            'by 13%, a court has heard. The federal court on Tuesday began '
            'hearing a challenge to the lawfulness of federal grants designed '
            'to incentivise exploratory drilling in the Northern Territory as '
            'part of the Morrison government’s gas-led economic recovery. The '
            'case, described by litigants Environment Centre NT, as a landmark '
            'piece of climate litigation, argues the minister was required to '
            'make reasonable inquiries into a range of matters before awarding '
            'Empire $21m from the $50m grant program, including the '
            'consequences for global heating and Australia’s targets under the '
            'Paris climate agreement. Pitt, who is defending his decision, has '
            'previously described the case as “green lawfare” and said the '
            'litigation threatens to delay an estimated 6,000 new jobs for the '
            'Northern Territory along with around $37bn in economic activity '
            'Perry Herzfeld, SC, – acting for the Environment Centre NT, which '
            'launched the case – argued on Tuesday that the government’s '
            'failure to investigate the climate consequences was “stark”.\n'
            '“There were no inquiries made into climate change risks at all, '
            'and, further, no inquiries made into whether such inquiries '
            'should be made or deferred until later,” Herzfeld told the court. '
            '“There’s nothing in the material before your honour which '
            'suggests any engagement with this at all.” He showed the court '
            'expert evidence suggesting that extracting and using gas from the '
            'Beetaloo Basin would use up the rest of Australia’s carbon budget '
            'under the Paris agreement. Sign up to receive an email with the '
            'top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'On one scenario, it would drive up Australia’s greenhouse gas '
            'emissions by 13%. “What’s observed is that combustion of gas from '
            'the Beetaloo Basin shale field would equate to a 13% increase on '
            'Australia’s 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, these are annual '
            'emissions,” he said. Herzfield argued that any activity in the '
            'Beetaloo, even exploration, would harm Australia’s prospects of '
            'meeting its Paris agreement targets. He also argued it was not '
            'clear that the plan for Beetaloo would deliver a net economic '
            'benefit to Australia and said there was a risk that it could '
            'become a “stranded asset that has failed to deliver a return on '
            'investment”. The court also heard that a request for '
            'confidentiality over a range of documents linked to the case had '
            'been agreed to by the parties due to much of it containing '
            '“market sensitive information”.\n'
            'But the request caused justice John Griffiths significant '
            'concern. “It just strikes me that the claim for confidentiality '
            'is too broad and in some respects unsubstantiated,” he said. In '
            'one exchange, the court was taken to Pitt’s announcement of the '
            'Beetaloo strategic plan on 17 December 2020, in which he '
            'described the basin as the “hottest play on the planet”. '
            'Griffiths asked: “What’s the ‘hottest play on the planet’, Mr '
            'Herzfield?” Herzfield suggested the phrase meant that the '
            'Beetaloo was the “most exciting gas resources on the planet at '
            'the moment”. Griffiths said: “The ‘hottest play’ is not a '
            'reference to climate change, I assume?” Herzfield responded '
            '“decidedly not”, prompting Griffiths to quip: “You didn’t '
            'actually have to answer that.” Herzfield is arguing that the '
            'failure to properly consider the climate risks meant that the '
            'government breached section 71 of the Public Governance, '
            'Performance, and Accountability Act 2013, which states that a '
            'minister “must not approve a proposed expenditure of relevant '
            'money unless the Minister is satisfied, after making reasonable '
            'inquiries, that the expenditure would be a proper use of relevant '
            'money”. He argued that should invalidate the grants to Empire. '
            'Tom Howe, QC, representing the minister, argued later on Tuesday '
            'that the expert evidence did not give any indication of the '
            'likely emissions specifically from the three wells Empire wants '
            'to use to explore the basin. The purpose of the grants was to '
            'fund those wells and those wells only, he said. Howe also argued '
            'that a finding that the minister had not reasonably inquired into '
            'climate risk did not necessarily mean the grants should be '
            'invalidated. The hearing continues on Wednesday.',

{'article': 'Everything in Muhammet Şahin’s garden is dead: the plants, his '
            'chickens, the bees. This summer’s unusually ferocious wildfires '
            'in south and west Turkey swept down on to his restaurant in the '
            'village of Osmaniye from two directions. As the flames rushed '
            'down the hillside, he and his wife had to evacuate, leaving their '
            'home and livelihood behind. The couple have managed to pay for a '
            'new roof and fixed glass windows that shattered in fires over two '
            'devastating weeks in August, when the blazes reached a heat '
            'intensity four times higher than Turkey’s previous record. But '
            'for Şahin and many of his neighbours there is still a lot of '
            'repair work to do, and serious questions remain. “I should have '
            'extinguished it myself but the electricity was out, the water was '
            'out. That’s why we had to leave,” the 50-year-old said. “If it '
            'happens again I will stay. The state was useless. It’s as if they '
            'wanted it to burn.” Marmaris is a popular tourism destination '
            'because of its natural beauty. But above the sparkling turquoise '
            'waters of the Mediterranean, much of what used to be dense green '
            'pine forest is now nothing more than eerie skeletons, charred and '
            'bare. Ash stirred up by the wind catches in the throat; the sound '
            'of chainsaws removing burned trees deemed too unsightly to remain '
            'near roads and resorts echoes through the dead forest. “We didn’t '
            'understand how fast it would spread,” said Fatma Aydın, a '
            '60-year-old who sells butter, cheese and yoghurt from her goats '
            'at a local market. She and her husband are waiting on his pension '
            'to come in next month to finish the work that needs doing on '
            'their property. “We have been devastated financially but next '
            'year I hope it won’t happen again because there is nothing left '
            'to burn.” Much has been said and written about democratic '
            'backsliding and the erasure of rule of law in Turkey during two '
            'decades of Justice and Development party (AKP) rule. But just as '
            'destructive, and much harder to fix, is the party’s addiction to '
            'concrete: the AKP has relied on large, job-heavy infrastructure '
            'projects as the engine of Turkey’s economy. Concerns about '
            'environmental damage have long been ignored. But this summer, a '
            'culmination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl '
            'and the climate crisis has finally made it impossible for Ankara '
            'to ignore the consequences of pursuing economic growth at the '
            'cost of everything else. Last month President Recep Tayyip '
            'Erdoğan finally ratified the Paris climate agreement, ahead of '
            'this week’s Cop26 environmental summit in Glasgow.\n'
            'Erdoğan faced significant blowback over state mismanagement and '
            'unpreparedness after admitting the country had no serviceable '
            'firefighting planes. According to Dr Cihan Erdönmez, a lecturer '
            'at Istanbul university’s forestry department, lessons have been '
            'learned across government after the summer fires disaster: a new '
            'fleet of planes will be established and the forestry ministry is '
            'increasing staffing levels. “However, it should not be forgotten '
            'that fires will always occur in this geography and the climate '
            'crisis will increase the number and impact of fires. Therefore, '
            'the real solution should be sought not in extinguishing fires, '
            'but in preventing fires,” he said. And while the summer blazes '
            'were the biggest in living memory, they are far from the '
            'country’s only pressing environmental problem. Also this August, '
            'the northern Black Sea region experienced the worst flooding on '
            'record, in which 81 people died. The biggest drought in a decade '
            'has left major cities with severely depleted water reserves and '
            'decimated this year’s wheat, barley and lentil crops; huge dam '
            'projects that have drowned traditional life in the majority '
            'Kurdish south-east have contributed to the drought problem rather '
            'than solved it.\n'
            'Large natural lakes have dried up, killing fish and birds, and '
            'rising temperatures in Istanbul’s Sea of Marmara left marine life '
            'suffocating under layers of “sea snot” released by out-of-control '
            'growth of phytoplankton. Europe’s plastic waste, sent to Turkey '
            'for recycling, has ended up illegally dumped, burned or thrown in '
            'the ocean, while the land has been scarred and polluted by the '
            'booming gold, mineral and lignite – low-quality coal – mining '
            'industries. “Turkish governments dating back to the 1970s have '
            'made national energy security and independence a primary goal as '
            'Turkey doesn’t have its own gas and black coal resources,” said '
            'Deniz Gümüsel, an environmental engineer and climate policy '
            'expert, who is camped out at a mining protest site not far from '
            'Marmaris. “There is no alternative in strategy other than relying '
            'on lignite for another 25 years, which exacerbates all of the '
            'problems. The fires and floods were interpreted as part of '
            'corruption issues and poor urbanisation policies in the country. '
            '[When it comes to climate change] there is still a lot that '
            'environmentalists must do to help society connect the dots,” she '
            'said. In a speech at the UN last month, Erdoğan made a surprise '
            'announcement that the country would finally ratify the Paris '
            'agreement on limiting global heating. Despite being the globe’s '
            '16th biggest carbon emitter and a member of the G20, Turkey has '
            'dragged its feet on implementing the 2015 international treaty '
            'over disagreements on whether it qualified for financial and '
            'technical support from wealthier nations. The only other '
            'countries yet to join are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Eritrea. '
            'It emerged that the Turkish parliament took the final legal step '
            'earlier this month after Ankara was offered financial guarantees '
            'from several European countries and two development banks. '
            'Details on the deal have not yet been published, but '
            'environmentalists believe Turkey has probably been extended a '
            'large credit line, as was the case with a similar initiative '
            'managed by the World Bank for a climate crisis strategy and '
            'action plan in 2009. Much of the $2.4bn (£1.7bn) was used to '
            'build hydropower plants in the Black Sea region, which have '
            'destroyed river systems and were blamed for exacerbating this '
            'year’s flooding.\n'
            'A small green movement has existed in Turkey for many years, and '
            'the 2013 Gezi park protest movement was sparked by plans to '
            'redevelop one of Istanbul’s green spaces. But even after a summer '
            'of destruction, environmental issues remain low on the political '
            'agenda. Turkey’s small Green Left party was joined by a new Green '
            'party in 2020. “We had no rain since March, so of course the '
            'fires were related to climate change,” said Mehmet Halil, a '
            'resident of Ormaniye who helped organise efforts to house '
            'displaced people during the fires. “Marmaris relies on tourists, '
            'they come and go, they don’t have to care … But this is our land. '
            'We will protect it.”',

{'article': 'As fireworks lit up the sky over Shanghai Disney Resort on '
            'Sunday, chatter began to spread through the crowds. Qian, a young '
            'Chinese woman who’d decided to spend her Halloween at the theme '
            'park, saw a Weibo alert from Disney saying the park had closed '
            'and rides had stopped. No more guests could enter Disneyland – '
            'those already inside, all 34,000 of them, would have to be tested '
            'and isolate. The news filtered through the throngs of parkgoers '
            'but, as Qian described, caused no panic, despite the worsening '
            'outbreak of Delta across 16 Chinese provinces. “The tourists '
            'around me started discussing this matter, but they all finished '
            'watching the first fireworks in peace,” she posted on Weibo. As '
            'they moved towards the exit, the crowd learned no one could leave '
            'until all were tested. They were ushered along outdoor trestle '
            'tables staffed by PPE-wearing healthworkers for testing, as the '
            'second evening fireworks show blasted in the background. The '
            'gates were closed and the rail lines shut down. “I never thought '
            'that the longest queue in Disneyland would be for a nucleic acid '
            'test,” another visitor wryly noted on social media.\n'
            'Late in the night more than 200 buses took people home for two '
            'days of self-isolation and further testing. Another 100,000 '
            'people who visited the park on the weekend will also be tested. '
            'The surreal scenes were prompted by the discovery of one case, a '
            'Saturday visitor Shanghai who was later found to be positive. '
            'Reports were conflicted on whether she had even gone to '
            'Disneyland. Disney’s initial alert had only attributed the '
            'closure to a need to “cooperate with the pandemic investigation '
            'in other provinces and cities”. Regardless, the park and '
            'Disneytown – its retail hub – shut until Wednesday.\n'
            'On Monday, China reported another 54 cases in a stubborn outbreak '
            'of Delta which, while dwarfed by numbers around the world, is '
            'threatening China’s commitment to remaining free from Covid. So '
            'far about 500 people have been diagnosed across at least 16 '
            'provinces, initially centred around Inner Mongolia but now mostly '
            'in Heilongjiang. Throughout the pandemic authorities have '
            'responded swiftly and strongly to outbreaks, with sudden '
            'lockdowns, transport restrictions and mass testing drives. But '
            'the high transmissibility of the Delta variant has seen a rise in '
            'more creative attempts to curb its spread. Communities are '
            'largely complying – in Heilongjiang an official bragged of the '
            '35,000 people who rushed to the testing stations, queueing under '
            'umbrellas. But tolerance is beginning to wane, especially when it '
            'involves so few cases. In Jiangxi authorities turned all traffic '
            'lights red to halt movement after a single case was identified – '
            'its first in almost two years. The move was reversed after public '
            'outcry. In Beijing some residents complained of glitchy health '
            'apps recording their location in the wrong place, and leaving '
            'them stranded. On Monday Beijing’s health commission asked people '
            'to avoid leaving or returning if possible. In Ruili, a small town '
            'on the border between China’s Yunnan and Myanmar, repeated '
            'lockdowns and waves of outbreaks have driven people away. Local '
            'media reported that one baby in the city who had been tested 74 '
            'times since September. In late October, someone who claimed to be '
            'a Ruili student posted on Weibo that he and his family were '
            'unable to return home. Local officials told Chinese media that '
            'since 2020 the number of residents had reduced from half a '
            'million to 200,000. “Impacted by the epidemic for a long time, '
            'many people found life hard to cope with,” one said. The mayor '
            'has made an extraordinary plea for help from Beijing. China, Hong '
            'Kong and Taiwan are among the last global jurisdictions still '
            'clinging to elimination strategies for the virus. For all three '
            'it involves the continuation of strict border closures and '
            'quarantine systems. Some have begun to question the '
            'sustainability of the strategy, as the rest of the world begins '
            'reopening and accepting life with the virus, mitigated by high '
            'rates of vaccination and less intrusive health measures. Others '
            'note that the strategy has worked – all three places are largely '
            'Covid free, having seen few of the world’s five million recorded '
            'deaths. In Shanghai, Qian praised the response at Disneyland. '
            '“One can really believe in Shanghai for ever. The response speed '
            'and the measures to deal with the epidemic are really fast and '
            'reasonable,” she said. “This Halloween will be unforgettable, a '
            'happy, beautiful, and wonderful journey with no dangers. I hope '
            'the epidemic gets better soon and everyone is safe and sound.”',

            'plane tickets and US$10,000 each to mark its new US$1.2bn '
            'valuation. Kami was founded in 2013 by Auckland university '
            'students Hengjie Wang, Jordan Thoms, and Alliv Samson, who were '
            'looking for a way to digitally streamline their note-taking. The '
            'service is now used in more than 180 countries and by more than '
            '30 million teachers and students, with its largest user-base in '
            'North America. Now, more than 90% of US schools are using the '
            'platform. Last week, the company secured the number one spot in '

            'revenue growth over the past three years”, according to '

            'platform’s future. “Fast forward 18 months, with that sort of '
            'massive shift in education, we saw maybe about five years’ worth '

{'article': 'The Reserve Bank of Australia has sent its strongest signal yet '
            'that the emergency measures it introduced to support the economy '
            'during the Covid pandemic will now be wound back, paving the way '
            'for an earlier than expected interest rate rise. As expected the '
            'central bank left the official cash rate target at the record low '
            '0.1% annual rate set at the November board meeting last year. '
            'Analysts’ attention, though, was focused on the shift in the '
            'language of its accompanying commentary. Previous months’ '
            'statements had identified 2024 as its “central scenario” when '
            'inflation would be “sustainably” within its 2%-3% target range. A '
            'recent pickup in core inflation to 2.1% in the September quarter '
            '– entering that target range for the first time in six years – '
            'and other recent signs of a recovery in the economy since the '
            'lifting of Delta Covid-19 lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT '
            'has given the RBA confidence to bring that date forward to 2023.\n'
            'In order for the actual inflation rate to remain within 2%-3%, '
            'the labour market will need to be “tight enough to generate wages '
            'growth that is materially higher than it is currently”, Reserve '
            'Bank governor Philip Lowe said, adding “this is likely to take '
            'some time”. “The board is prepared to be patient, with the '
            'central forecast being for underlying inflation to be no higher '
            'than 2.5% at the end of 2023 and for only a gradual increase in '
            'wages growth,” he said. The country’s central bank declared “a '
            'bounce back is now under way” after the Delta outbreak, with '
            'companies now hiring and the job rate set to trend lower for the '
            'next couple of years. The RBA expects GDP growth of 3% over 2021, '
            'and 5.5% and 2.5% over the following two years, it said. “One '
            'important source of uncertainty continues to be the possibility '
            'of a further setback on the health front.” The encouraging '
            'comments about the economy will likely mean interest rates rise '
            'sooner than that 2024 scenario previously stated by the bank. '
            'While the cash rate was left unchanged for now, the RBA has '
            'surrendered to market forces and ceased trying to keep the yield '
            'on the benchmark April 2024 to just 10 basis points, or 0.1%. '
            'However, the bank also maintained its bond buying at the $4bn a '
            'week pace until at least mid-February 2022. “The decision to '
            'discontinue the yield target reflects the improvement in the '
            'economy and the earlier-than-expected progress towards the '
            'inflation target,” Lowe said. “Given that other market interest '
            'rates have moved in response to the increased likelihood of '
            'higher inflation and lower unemployment, the effectiveness of the '
            'yield target in holding down the general structure of interest '
            'rates in Australia has diminished.” The Australian dollar dropped '
            'below the US75 cent mark, bond yields fell, and the stockmarket '
            'rose after the RBA statement. Economists including AMP’s Shane '
            'Oliver continue to expect the first rise in official interest '
            'rates to come by the end of 2022.\n'
            'Maxime Darmet, a director at Fitch Ratings, said “it’s really '
            'like the first step we think towards the normalisation of '
            '[Australia’s] monetary policy settings, which had been very loose '
            'since the pandemic”. However, he said should the recovery remain '
            'strong we can expect more adjustments sooner than the 2023 RBA '
            'forecast: “It’s very possible that in the next meeting they would '
            'think it would be 2022.” Evidence the RBA can start paring back '
            'emergency measures will be noted elsewhere, with the central '
            'banks of the US and the UK also holding key meetings this week. '
            'The US Federal Open Market Committee begins two days of meetings '
            'today and investors are expecting it to announce a reduction – or '
            'tapering – of its quantitative easing problem on Wednesday. Since '
            'March 2020 as the first Covid waves disrupted the world economy, '
            'the Fed has been buying up $US120b in bonds and mortgages each '
            'month to drive down interest rates and support the economy. On '
            'Thursday, the Bank of England announces its policy decision, with '
            'investors wary that it will lift interest rates to quell rising '
            'inflation in the UK. In Australia’s case, the RBA has already '
            'eased its bond-buying binge from $5bn a week to $4bn in its bid '
            'to keep commercial banks flush with cheap money that they can '
            'lend. Much of the borrowing activity, though, has ended up in '
            'residential housing. October house prices were almost 22% higher '
            'than a year ago, CoreLogic said on Monday. Separate figures from '
            'the Australian Bureau of Statistics, also out yesterday, revealed '
            'a small drop in housing lending for owner-occupied housing in '
            'September but the tally was 49% higher than pre-Covid levels in '
            'February 2020. Fitch’s Darmet said the RBA had been relatively '
            '“dovish” in its signalling that it was not worried about '
            'inflation. However, it also couldn’t be seen to be too slow in '
            'responding as central banks in the US, Canada and soon the UK '
            'prepare to wind back support for the economy. “You’re seeing so '
            'much pressure on prices at a global level with energy prices '
            'spiking, with supply bottlenecks persisting and so on,” Darmet '
            'said. “It’s a very dovish central bank but starting gradually to '
            'come around to the new reality that inflation is going to be '
            'probably higher than they expected.” While mortgage holders can '
            'take some relief from Tuesday’s RBA comments that an interest '
            'rate rise isn’t around the corner, Australia and other nations '
            'have allowed housing prices to rise too far too fast for the '
            'overall health of the economy, not to mention housing '
            'affordability for those not in the market. “Low interest rates '
            'are the main channel through which people are taking on more '
            'debt,” Darmet said. “[It] can become a concern in terms of not '
            'only affordability for low income households, but also it creates '
            'a lot of potential financial instability and risk. “And this is '
            'something many central banks are not taking too seriously,” the '
            'Fitch analyst said. In an unusual webinar – used to explain '
            '“important announcements” – Lowe said Tuesday’s meeting had not '
            'discussed house prices “in any detail”. “At the moment, I don’t '
            'have any concerns about the deterioration in lending standards” '
            'for home loans, Lowe said. Instead, the focus was on the decision '
            'to end the yield curve target, which had made recent days '
            '“turbulent ones in the bond market”, he said. The central bank '
            'chief also made it clear the RBA is not about to lift its cash '
            'target rate, dismissing market predictions of a rise as soon as '
            'next March “as a complete overreaction to the recent inflation '
            'data”. A reason for caution is that the Covid pandemic might not '
            'have finished in terms of its ability to throw the economy off '
            'track. “One source of such a shock would be a new strain of the '
            'virus or a decline in vaccine effectiveness,” Lowe said. “In this '
            'case, the cash rate would need to remain at its current level for '
            'longer than otherwise.” While there are supply shortages of some '
            'goods, those could ease over the coming six months or so as '
            'consumers respond to the end of lockdowns by switching some of '
            'their spending to services. While many overseas economies faced '
            'higher energy prices, Australia’s electricity prices at least are '
            'lower than a year ago, Lowe said, as was reported last month.',

            'and Netflix of breach of contract by using footage of the couple '
            'in the trailer of Tiger King 2. The second series of the '
            'stranger-than-fiction documentary is scheduled for release on 17 '
            'November.\n'
            'According to Variety, the lawsuit was filed on Monday, with the '
            'couple arguing they only signed appearance release forms for the '
            'first series, which Carole Baskin later described as “a reality '
            'show dumpster fire”. The lawsuit states: “By utilizing the film '
            'footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode '
            'Productions under the Appearance Releases in ‘sizzle reels’ and '

            'Defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance '
            'Releases.” The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix '
            'to ditch all footage of them from Tiger King 2. The lawsuit also '
            'claims that the first series was misleading in its depiction of '
            'Big Cat Rescue’s operations and unfairly accused the Baskins of '
            'animal abuse. Carole Baskin is also claiming the first series '
            'perniciously implicated her in the disappearance of her first '
            'husband in 1997.\n'
            'The Guardian has sought comment from Netflix in the US. Millions '
            'of viewers became enthralled watching Tiger King, with the '
            'intense hatred between Joe Exotic, the showman owner of the '
            'Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, and animal '
            'conservationist Carole Baskin central to the real-life drama. In '
            '2018, Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was '
            'arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin. The '
            'following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of '
            'animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced '
            'to a 22-year prison sentence in Fort Worth, Texas.\n'
            'Exotic is currently appealing the harshness of the sentence and '
            'has sold his zoo. In January this year, an Oklahoma federal judge '

{'article': 'Lawyers for the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, are arguing '
            'behind closed doors for suppressions on a judgment that '
            'overturned prior secrecy orders in the trial of the barrister '
            'Bernard Collaery. The layer upon layer of secrecy in the case has '
            'prompted renewed criticism from human rights lawyers, who say the '
            'loss of open justice erodes public confidence. Collaery, a lawyer '
            'and former Australian Capital Territory attorney general, is '
            'facing trial for allegedly disclosing intelligence information '
            'about a 2004 mission by Australia to bug its impoverished ally '
            'Timor-Leste during oil and gas negotiations. He and his client, '
            'the former intelligence officer Witness K, have been described as '
            'heroes of Timor-Leste for their actions, including by the former '
            'president Jose Ramos-Horta.\n'
            'Last month Collaery won a major battle in the ACT court of appeal '
            'to remove secrecy orders shrouding significant parts of his '
            'prosecution from the public. In a summary of its decision, the '
            'court cited the importance of open justice in preventing '
            '“political prosecutions”. “The court emphasised that the open '
            'hearing of criminal trials was important because it deterred '
            'political prosecutions, allowed the public to scrutinise the '
            'actions of prosecutors, and permitted the public to properly '
            'assess the conduct of the accused person,” the summary said. '
            'Almost four weeks later, the court’s full judgment has still not '
            'been published. On Tuesday Australia’s attorney general again '
            'intervened in the case, this time asking for significant parts of '
            'the judgment to be redacted, on grounds including national '
            'security. Arguments for redactions took place briefly in open '
            'court. The court was then closed to the public and media to allow '
            'the attorney general, represented by Anna Mitchelmore SC, to '
            'fully make the case for suppressions. A Human Rights Law Centre '
            'senior lawyer, Kieran Pender, said the court of appeal had '
            'already made clear that secrecy in the Collaery case erodes '
            'public confidence. “The next step in this sorry saga should be to '
            'drop the charges altogether, not to argue for more secrecy, at a '
            'secret hearing, about a judgment that said no to a secret trial,” '
            'he said. The federal government has until Wednesday to tell the '

            'Guardian Australia has surveyed the register of interests of all '
            'members and senators to audit their use of trusts in the wake of '
            'Christian Porter declaring that his defamation legal fees were '
            'part-paid by the Legal Services Trust with funds from undisclosed '
            'donors. Although the privileges committee of both houses have '
            'been asked to consider clarifying the rules around financing '
            'legal cases, Labor’s complaint about Porter raises the broader '
            'issue that trusts declared by parliamentarians can be used to '
            'receive fees or donations for private purposes from unknown '
            'sources. Parliamentarians declared an array of trusts including '
            'for investment purposes, self-managed super funds, and family '
            'trusts relating to businesses including agricultural concerns. On '
            '8 October, Hughes declared a shareholding in SLN Services Pty '
            'Ltd, the trustee of the SLN Services Trust, which she disclosed '
            'is “a discretionary trust in which the senator is a potential '
            'beneficiary and provides consultancy services, including in '
            'relation to charitable organisations”. The declaration includes '
            'no further details of entities that pay the trust for services.\n'
            'Hughes told Guardian Australia that through the trust she and '
            '“others, whoever I want to engage” perform advisory work for the '
            'board of PBFH Pty Ltd – Pacific Biofuels Holdings – which she '
            'said had “set up a charitable arm, a social services arm” to '
            '“reinvest in local communities”. The trust is paid an '
            'undisclosed, fixed annual fee. “[PBFH is] an Australian company '
            'setting up in PNG, and they’ve asked me to assist them because I '
            'used to run charities in Australia but also know PNG,” Hughes '
            'said. “I haven’t been a beneficiary of anything – yet. But we set '
            '[SLN Services Trust] up because at some stage I may be a '
            'beneficiary of it.” “The reason I had to set something up is I’m '
            'not an employee of theirs [PBFH]”. We’re not trying to hide '
            'anything, there wouldn’t be a problem putting PBFH on the '
            'register of interests … We have done this all the right way.”\n'
            'Hughes said PBFH is the only entity to have paid SLN Services '
            'Trust, which has no other potential beneficiaries “at the '
            'moment”. Hughes is the sole director and secretary of the trustee '
            'company and has a beneficial interest in 100% of its shares. Zach '
            'Frederick, PBFH’s social change director, told Guardian Australia '
            'it is a “new, for-profit company that will be using a portion of '
            'its profits to effect beneficial social programs in PNG and '
            'throughout the South Pacific”. “These programs include investing '
            'in education and local health initiatives.” An engagement letter '
            'sent to Hughes in September by the PBFH chief executive, Mary '
            'Symons, states that SLN Services will advise on “social change '
            'programs, aimed at improving the lives of the people in the '
            'Central Province”. Symons wrote PBFH had selected SLN Services '
            'due to “extensive experience in charitable work and your deep '
            'understanding of the mechanics of how to best obtain positive '
            'outcomes”. Before entering parliament, Hughes was the chair of '
            'the Country Autism Network for seven years and a non-executive '
            'director of Streetwork, a charity for at-risk youth. PBFH advised '
            'it had “no agreements with the Australian commonwealth”, ensuring '
            'that Hughes’ work would not disqualify her from sitting in '
            'parliament. In June, the Senate clerk, Richard Pye, provided '
            'advice to Hughes on the declaration of senators’ interests. Pye '
            'noted that senators are required to declare “any other '
            'substantial sources of income” using the rule of thumb that '
            'income of more than $5,000 a year should be disclosed. “I expect '
            'that Senator Hughes would need to make a declaration here,” he '
            'said, commenting on an earlier letter of offer before Hughes '
            'decided to provide services through a trust. Hughes has not '
            'declared any “other” sources of income. A spokesperson for Hughes '
            'said the corporate advisory work “has been disclosed as a '
            'registrable interest”. The Nationals senator Susan McDonald '
            'discloses on her register of interests that she is a '
            'discretionary beneficiary of “OHG Trust”, which is described as a '
            '“consultancy”. A spokesperson for McDonald said it was “set up to '
            'provide consultancy prior to the senator’s election” but “has '
            'been inactive since then with no services being provided by '
            'anyone or to anyone”. McDonald has not received a distribution '
            'from the trust since becoming a senator, they said.',

{'article': 'The New South Wales government has brought forward a raft of '
            'freedoms for fully vaccinated residents, while delaying when '
            'unvaccinated people can exit stay-at-home orders. From Monday 8 '
            'November, fully vaccinated people will be able to have unlimited '
            'visitors to their home, density limits on venues will ease and '
            'dancing will be allowed at nightclubs. Under the original '
            'roadmap, restrictions were supposed to ease from 1 December. The '
            'NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the changes were due to the '
            'state’s high vaccination rate, with authorities pushing NSW to '
            'hit 95% double dose coverage. “We said from the outset that this '
            'was the key for our state to be able to open up safely,” '
            'Perrottet said. “Everybody has done an incredible job to ensure '
            'NSW can ease restrictions in a safe and considered way earlier '
            'than we planned. [This] is one last push and I believe that we '
            'can get to that 95% mark.” The changes also delay when '
            'restrictions ease for unvaccinated people – either when the state '
            'hits that 95% fully vaccinated rate or by 15 December, whichever '
            'occurs first.\n'
            'This means unvaccinated residents will continue to be barred from '
            'businesses, gyms and venues for at least two weeks more than '
            'expected. Perrottet said the delay was to ensure the state could '
            'continue reopening “safely” and hoped it would incentivise people '
            'to get the jab. “Ultimately we want a united society and we '
            'believe by moving that date back to December 15 will incentivise” '
            'he said. Caps on gym and dance classes remain, but entertainment '
            'venues with fixed seating will open to 100% capacity. Indoor '
            'swimming pools will also be able to reopen. The mask mandate will '
            'also remain until the state hits 95% fully vaccinated, or 15 '
            'December. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, welcomed rising '
            'vaccination rates and the changes, calling them a “giant step” '
            'for the state. “A year and a half ago we all wondered whether we '
            'would get vaccinated or whether we would ever get our freedoms '
            'back,” he said. “A little as three or four months ago, when '
            'things were looking dark, we were all wondering if we’ll be able '
            'to get through the next few months. “This really is a giant step '
            'for all of us, and how good is it that we have actually faced '
            'down this enemy of this hidden virus and managed to get our '
            'freedoms back.” Hazzard said while vaccination rates in western '
            'Sydney were “absolutely amazing”, there were still some concerns '
            'for the Hunter region. “The message is: the virus is still out '
            'there,” he said. In NSW 93.6% of people eligible have now had at '
            'least one dose of the vaccine, while 87.8% are fully vaccinated. '
            'The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, urged young '
            'people to take up the vaccine or to book their second dose. Sign '
            'up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian '
            'Australia every morning\n'
            '“I know you haven’t had access to the vaccines for as long … but '
            'just to reiterate, there is plenty of vaccine and plenty of '
            'access points for you,” she said. “We know those age groups '
            'actually drive transmission. “They are the connectors in our '
            'society, they connect with younger people and they also connect '
            'with older people. They also have more social contacts. So it is '
            'critical we achieve high rates of coverage in those groups.” The '
            'changes were announced as the state recorded 173 new locally '
            'acquired cases, and four deaths: two men in their 50s, one man in '
            'his 60s and one man in his 70s. Victoria recorded 989 new locally '
            'acquired cases and nine deaths on Tuesday, dropping below 1,000 '

            'with Qantas during lockdown in August, the Sydney publicist and '

            'Centrelink, Service NSW and Services Australia as well Qantas’s '
            'CEO Alan Joyce. She also lobbied the federal arts minister Paul '
            'Fletcher and New South Wales customer service minister Victor '
            'Dominello.\n'
            'A petition launched on Change.org – Hold Aussie Music – has so '

            'Recording Industry Association (Aria) and the music copyright '
            'organisation Apra Amcos have both thrown their support behind the '
            'campaign. Now Eck has ramped up the volume, with a plan to target '
            '30 brands in 30 days over the month of November. “The Australian '
            'music industry has been on its knees during the pandemic, so why '
            'shouldn’t big corporations give our local musicians a platform to '
            'showcase their work?” Eck told Guardian Australia. “It’s just '
            'about choosing a playlist that supports our incredible talent in '
            'Australia.” The companies selected for targeting will be at the '
            'suggestion of the campaign’s supporters, with NRMA, Apple, '
            'Telstra, Optus, Sydney airport and the Australian Taxation Office '
            'in its sights. Large businesses that already play commercial '
            'music but are being asked to switch to more Australian content '
            'include Medicare, Energy Australia, Centrelink, MyGov and three '
            'of the four big banks.\n'
            'On Tuesday, tagging #HoldAussieMusic, ME Bank in Melbourne '

            'new homegrown tunes, including those from Jack River, Tones and '
            'I, Budjerah, Birdz and Gang of Youths. Eck said she believes many '
            'companies are simply unaware of what their customers experience '
            'when they are placed on hold. “The people in positions of power, '
            'the decision-makers, they are never put on hold with their own '
            'business, so they often just don’t think very much about it,” she '

            '“And there are companies that can curate playlists for individual '
            'businesses, who can make sure that the music is appropriate for '
            'the brand, that it has the right tempo, the right tone. “A '
            'businesses can really use their music on their call-holding '
            'system as a platform to reflect their own brand.” Supermarket '
            'wars On Monday, Woolworths announced a new partnership with '
            'Australian Radio Network, owners of the KIIS Network, The Edge '
            'and iHeartRadio brands. The deal includes an undertaking to play '
            'more Australian artists in Woolworths’ 995 stores across the '
            'country (subject to the tastes of each store’s demographic) and '
            'on the supermarket’s digital radio via the iHeartRadio app. “It '
            'will be shopping trolleys at 50 paces as Australia’s two '
            'supermarket giants go head-to-head with in-store entertainment,” '
            'Radio Today declared, referring to a longstanding partnership '
            'between Woolworth’s only competitor, Coles, and Nova '
            'Entertainment.\n'
            'In 2019, the Coles/Nova partnership saw Coles Radio topping the '
            'digital-only radio ratings, with 254,000 listeners across the '
            'country each week (ABC’s Double J was second, with 221,000 '

            'since the start of the pandemic to push for more Australian music '
            'in the corporate sector. In August, singer-songwriter Holly '

            'Woolworths, Aldi and banks to use more local music in-store and '
            'in their ads. Coles responded by announcing it would turn up the '
            'volume on its commitment to local music. In October, the Aria-led '

{'article': 'Robert Durst was indicted on Monday for murder in the death of '
            'his first wife, Kathie McCormack Durst, who disappeared nearly '
            'four decades ago. The multimillionaire real estate heir is '
            'currently serving a life sentence in California for the murder of '
            'Susan Berman, his friend and confidante who prosecutors say '
            'helped him cover up Kathie Durst’s killing. Durst was '
            'hospitalized on a ventilator with Covid-19 after his 14 October '
            'sentencing in the Los Angeles case and was transferred last week '
            'to a state prison hospital. His current medical condition was not '
            'released. A grand jury in the New York City suburbs returned the '
            'second-degree murder indictment on Monday. “When Kathleen Durst '
            'disappeared on January 31, 1982, her family and friends were left '
            'with pain, anguish and questions that have contributed to their '
            'unfaltering pursuit of justice for the last 39 years,” the '
            'Westchester district attorney, Mimi Rocah, said in a statement '
            'announcing the indictment. Rocah said her office had '
            '“reinvigorated its investigation” into Robert Durst when she took '
            'office in January, launching a cold case unit and dedicating '
            'necessary skill and resources. She decided to take the case to a '
            'grand jury in early October. Rocah said Durst’s indictment was a '
            '“huge step forward in the pursuit of justice for Kathie Durst, '
            'her family and victims of domestic violence everywhere”. Asked by '
            'a reporter if he had any reaction to the indictment, Durst’s '
            'lawyer Chip Lewis replied in an email: “Fake news!” Asked in a '
            'subsequent email if he would be representing Durst in the New '
            'York case and whether there were health concerns about moving him '
            'to New York, Lewis responded: “Not sure he will make it. But if '
            'he does, I’ll let you know.” A lawyer for Kathie Durst’s family '
            'said they were still processing the news of the indictment and '
            'would speak more about the matter in the coming days. Kathie '
            'Durst’s 1982 disappearance garnered renewed public interest after '
            'HBO aired a documentary in 2015 in which Durst appeared to admit '
            'killing people, stepping off camera and muttering to himself on a '
            'live microphone: “Killed them all, of course.” Kathie Durst was '
            '29 and in her final months of medical school when she was last '
            'seen. She and Robert Durst, who was 38 at the time, had been '
            'married nearly nine years and were living in South Salem, a '
            'community in Lewisboro, New York. Her body was never found. '
            'Robert Durst divorced her in 1990, citing abandonment. At the '
            'request of her family, she was declared legally dead in 2017. '
            'Robert Durst had never previously been charged in her '
            'disappearance. In December 2000, Durst shot and killed Berman as '
            'she was preparing to tell police about her involvement in Kathie '
            'Durst’s death, prosecutors said. She had told friends she '
            'provided a phony alibi for him after his wife vanished, according '
            'to prosecutors. Durst was convicted in September of killing '
            'Berman. Afterward, the Los Angeles prosecutor John Lewin '
            'described him as a “narcissistic psychopath”, saying Durst had '
            '“killed his wife and then he had to keep killing to cover it up”. '
            'Durst, testifying in the Los Angeles trial in August, denied '
            'killing Kathie Durst. After her medical school called to report '
            'that she hadn’t been going to class, he said he figured she was '
            '“out someplace having fun” and suggested that perhaps drug use '
            'was to blame. “It hadn’t occurred to me that anything had '
            'happened to her,” Durst said, speaking slowly in a strained, '
            'raspy voice. “It was more like: what had Kathie done to Kathie?”',

{'article': 'Misinformation and sceptical views about Covid-19 and vaccines '
            'has been allowed to spread on more than a dozen Facebook and '
            'Instagram accounts, pages and groups that together have gained '
            '370,000 followers over the past year, according to a report. The '
            'misinformation and promotion of vaccine hesitancy includes posts '
            'in Facebook groups claiming that children are being “murdered by '
            'the experimental jab they’re being pressured to take”, and an '
            'Instagram account promoting a documentary by Andrew Wakefield, '
            'one of the key figures in promoting discredited links between MMR '
            'inoculation and autism. The 20 accounts, pages and groups have '
            'been tracked by NewsGuard, an organisation that monitors online '
            'misinformation. Since September last year NewsGuard has submitted '
            'regular reports to the World Health Organization, at the WHO’s '
            'request, flagging social media sites and other digital platforms '
            'that are spreading falsehoods about Covid-19. In research '
            'published on Tuesday, NewsGuard said 20 of the sites that it had '
            'monitored over that period had gained a total of 372,670 '
            'followers. A full report containing the research has been sent to '
            'the WHO. The NewsGuard research points to prominent sources of '
            'vaccine scepticism such as the Facebook pages of Robert F Kennedy '
            'Jr, a prominent anti-vaxxer, and Joseph Mercola, an alternative '
            'medicine doctor, as well as smaller sources such as the France '
            'Soir account on Instagram. Kennedy was banned from Instagram over '
            'his vaccine stance in February but his Facebook page and '
            'Mercola’s Instagram account have gained more than 140,000 '
            'followers since February, according to NewsGuard. Mercola has '
            'said he has “every right to inform the public by sharing my '
            'medical research”. Facebook came under pressure to ban Kennedy, '
            'the nephew of President John F Kennedy, in March when he released '
            'a documentary, Medical Racism, which has been accused of seeking '
            'to promote vaccine hesitancy among black Americans. Kennedy has '
            'said the film “empowers all Americans to demand the safest '
            'vaccines”. Facebook and Instagram are both owned by Meta, the '
            'company that until a rebranding last week was known as Facebook. '
            'Alex Cardier, the UK managing director for NewsGuard, said '
            'Facebook and Instagram were failing to protect their users from '
            'Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation despite having been warned '
            '“repeatedly”. He said: “The company’s engagement-at-all-costs '
            'mantra means that viral and divisive sources of misinformation '
            'continue to flourish, despite warnings from NewsGuard and the '
            'clear danger posed to users. Facebook gave itself a new name but '
            'their promotion of misinformation remains the same.” A Meta '
            'spokesperson said the company was encouraging users of its '
            'platforms to get vaccinated and it was taking action against '
            'misinformation. “During the pandemic we have removed more than '
            '20m pieces of harmful misinformation and we’ve taken down content '
            'identified in this report which violates our rules. In total '
            'we’ve now banned more than 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for '
            'repeatedly breaking our rules. We’re also labelling all posts '
            'about the vaccines with accurate information and worked with '
            'independent factcheckers to mark 190m posts as false.” In an '
            'effort to reassure users on the efficacy of vaccines, several of '
            'the Facebook pages highlighted by NewsGuard contained Facebook '
            'labels directing users to a WHO page on vaccines or the company’s '
            'own Covid-19 information centre page. Meta announced last week '
            'that was stepping up efforts to promote vaccination efforts for '
            'children on its apps.',

{'article': 'Australia finally has a net zero target. Even without being '
            'legislated, it matters as a signal. It will effectively be '
            'bipartisan, a rare and valuable thing in Australia’s climate '
            'policy. Of course the long-term goal could be used to deflect '
            'from the fact that not much is being done to put Australia on a '
            'low-carbon pathway right now, but it must be taken at face value '
            'if we are to stand a chance. How can Australia become net zero? '
            'Technically the answer is quite clear, and has been for a long '
            'time. What has changed is that more and more zero emissions '
            'options are available at lower and lower cost. The task is now '
            'easier than we thought it would be just five years ago.\n'
            'It starts with a complete shift to clean energy in electricity '
            'supply. In Australia, the cost-effective power system of the '
            'future is a mix of solar and wind power, with energy storage in '
            'batteries and pumped-hydro plants, and gas plants at the ready '
            'for occasional use when needed. It means huge investments that '
            'will give us zero emissions power at low operating costs. The '
            'task this decade is to mobilise those investments for the clean '
            'energy future. Record amounts of solar and wind are being '
            'installed in Australia, now driven largely by commercial '
            'decisions. The process needs to be sped up. We need reform in the '
            'electricity market, including the planned and accelerated '
            'decommissioning of remaining coal plants, and the rapid building '
            'of new transmission lines. Coal has no role in our future '
            'electricity system, as new plants with carbon capture and storage '
            'would be far more expensive and still have some remaining carbon '
            'emissions. It is possible that other technologies will play a '
            'role but right now nothing else matches renewables for '
            'affordability. Nuclear has a role in countries where renewable '
            'power is more limited. For it to be viable economically in '
            'Australia, it would need a dramatic drop in cost which is not in '
            'sight. The grid of the future will be far more decentralised, '
            'relying more on local power sources, especially solar panels and '
            'small-scale storage. That includes electric cars: collectively '
            'the car-owning public will build up a massive battery capacity on '
            'wheels which can bolster the system through vehicle-to-grid '
            'charging. Zero emissions electricity supply will power most of '
            'the things that now use oil, gas or coal. “Electrify everything” '
            'is the battle cry. In transport that includes electric cars and '
            'trucks, and heavy transport using clean hydrogen made using '
            'renewable power. In industry it means shifting to electricity as '
            'a heat source, and using clean hydrogen as energy feedstock. In '
            'buildings it means electric heat pumps and induction cooktops. '
            'Out with the gas. Much of this will need policy support of one '
            'kind or another. A price on carbon emissions is an essential part '
            'of the policy mix, starting in industry. These are new battle '
            'lines for the energy industry. Governments and industry are '
            'pushing hard for a continued role for gas, and possibly coal, as '
            'the feedstock for hydrogen production. That is now cheaper than '
            'making hydrogen from renewable electricity through electrolysis, '
            'but it has remaining emissions even if carbon capture and storage '
            'is used, and the electric route is quickly becoming cheaper. The '
            'same goes for the possible clean energy export industries of the '
            'future – hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic fuels – even processing '
            'iron ore into iron and steel – can all run on the back of '
            'renewable power.\n'
            'Carbon capture and storage will likely have a niche role in '
            'specific cases where there are no alternatives or where it is '
            'cheapest. Cement production is an example. In some cases, the '
            'captured carbon could be used as a material. Then there is '
            'agriculture, which now accounts for about 14% of greenhouse gas '
            'emissions in Australia. That’s a matter of improvements in '
            'agricultural practices, and shifting the product mix away from '
            'cattle and sheep, which are heavy emitters of methane which is '
            'driving global warming in the short term. So where in all this is '
            'the need for new technologies, which the government’s net zero '
            '“plan” portrays as the only thing that matters? Innovation will '
            'make known clean technologies cheaper and better, and in a few '
            'specific areas new technologies are needed. But the overwhelming '
            'part of the journey can and will be done using technologies that '
            'are in use now. It is a matter of deploying existing technologies '
            'at scale, rapidly. We should plan ahead with some future '
            'technologies but we do not need to wait for technology. Some '
            'greenhouse gas emissions will remain. And that is fine, they will '
            'be compensated for by drawing carbon dioxide out of the '
            'atmosphere. That is why it is called net zero. Photosynthesis is '
            'an excellent way to take carbon dioxide from the air, for example '
            'through revegetation of marginal grazing lands, also through '
            'better management of agricultural soils. But any area of land '
            'eventually reaches its carbon saturation point so this is not a '
            'forever option. That is where carbon dioxide removal through '
            'technological means comes in. It includes carbon dioxide capture '
            'directly from the air, and some other technologies such as '
            'enhanced weathering for specific minerals. These options are '
            'costly and energy-intensive. But their cost will come down with '
            'research and experience, and they would be powered by renewable '
            'energy. This continent has the preconditions to do carbon dioxide '
            'removal at large scale. Australia could become a net negative '
            'emissions economy. That would mean becoming an exporter of '
            'emissions removal services, alongside energy and energy-intensive '
            'products made using renewable energy. The government’s “plan” '
            'assumes purchasing offset credits from other countries. This is '
            'curious given Australia’s relative advantage in land availability '
            'and renewable energy. It also misses one of the key areas where '
            'future R&D is needed and could directly result in positioning '
            'Australia better for a net zero world economy.\n'
            'Right now we cannot assess the basis for the offset assumption. '
            'That is because the government is withholding the '
            'technical/modelling report that informed the net zero decision. '
            'It suits politicians to release high-level documents prepared '
            'with help from consultancy firms before the analysis that is '
            'prepared by government departments. But it amounts to a failure '
            'of proper process in an open democracy. It enables obfuscation '
            'and monopolises information. To understand Australia’s '
            'opportunities and pressure points in the transition to net zero '
            'we need an open, inclusive, genuine process. One that allows '
            'building truly shared understanding, and that keeps the politics '
            'at arms length from the deliberations about long-term national '
            'strategy. Putting in place a genuine process for a long-term '
            'emissions strategy is a chance for the next federal government, '
            'whichever party wins. • Frank Jotzo is a professor at the '

{'article': 'Thousands of babies in England are being born prematurely, '
            'smaller than expected or stillborn because of “alarming” and '
            '“devastating” socioeconomic and racial inequalities across the '
            'country, a landmark study has suggested. Both are known risk '
            'factors for poor pregnancy outcomes. However, until now, little '
            'has been known about the scale of their “heartbreaking” impact on '
            'women and babies. Now research involving more than 1m births '
            'suggests socioeconomic inequalities account for a quarter of all '
            'stillbirths, a fifth of preterm births, and a third of cases of '
            'foetal growth restriction (FGR), a condition in which babies are '
            'smaller than expected for their gestational age. At the same '
            'time, one in 10 stillbirths and almost one in five FGR cases are '
            'due to racial inequalities, the study suggests. The findings, '
            'which have prompted calls for urgent action, were published in '
            'the medical journal the Lancet. Dr Jennifer Jardine of the Royal '
            'College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (RCOG), one of the '
            'study’s co-lead authors, said: “I think that people will be '
            'shocked. The stark reality is that across England, women’s '
            'socioeconomic and ethnic background are still strongly related to '
            'their likelihood of experiencing serious adverse outcomes for '
            'their baby.” The review, which was conducted by a team from the '
            'National Maternity and Perinatal Audit, analysed 1,155,981 birth '
            'records between April 2015 and March 2017 in NHS hospitals in '
            'England. The analysis estimates that 24% of stillbirths, 19% of '
            'preterm births, and 31% of FGR cases were attributed to '
            'socioeconomic inequality and would not have occurred if all women '
            'had the same risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as women in the '
            'least-deprived group. Adjusting for ethnicity, maternal smoking '
            'and body mass index (BMI) substantially reduced these '
            'inequalities. That suggests that these characteristics can '
            'explain a considerable part of the socioeconomic inequalities in '
            'pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy complications disproportionately '
            'affected Black and minority-ethnic women: 12% of all stillbirths, '
            '1% of preterm births, and 17% of FGR cases were attributed to '
            'ethnic inequality. Prof Jan van der Meulen of the London School '
            'of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, another co-lead author, told the '
            'Guardian the disparities were unacceptable but said there were no '
            'quick fixes that could immediately solve the problem. The NHS has '
            'set a target of halving stillbirth and neonatal death rates and '
            'reducing levels of preterm birth by 25% by 2025. However, the '
            'study findings suggest that current national programmes to make '
            'pregnancy safer, which focus on an individual woman’s risk and '
            'behaviour and their antenatal care, will not be enough to improve '
            'outcomes for babies born in England. To reduce disparities in '
            'birth outcomes at a national level, Van der Meulen said, '
            'politicians, public health professionals and healthcare providers '
            'must work together to tackle racism and discrimination and '
            'improve women’s social circumstances, social support and health '
            'throughout their lives. “National targets to make pregnancy safer '
            'will only be achieved if there is a concerted effort by midwives, '
            'obstetricians, public health professionals and politicians to '
            'tackle the broader socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities,” he '
            'said.\n'
            'The largest increases in excess risk of complications among the '
            'most socioeconomically disadvantaged Black and south Asian and '
            'women. Half of stillbirths (53.5%) and seven in 10 FGR cases '
            '(71.7%) among south Asian women living in the most deprived fifth '
            'of neighbourhoods in England could be avoidable if they had the '
            'same risks as white women in the most affluent fifth, the study '
            'suggests. This was similarly the case for nearly two-thirds of '
            'stillbirths (63.7%) and half of FGR cases (55%) among Black women '
            'from the most deprived neighbourhoods.\n'
            '“There are many possible reasons for these disparities,” said Van '
            'der Meulen. “Women from deprived neighbourhoods and Black and '
            'minority ethnic groups may be at a disadvantage because of their '
            'environment, for example, because of pollution, poor housing, '
            'social isolation, limited access to maternity and health care, '
            'insecure employment, poor working conditions, and stressful life '
            'events.” Dr Edward Morris, the president of the RCOG, said the '
            'findings of the study were alarming, adding: “They provide more '
            'evidence that poverty, racism and discrimination can affect women '
            'throughout their lives and ultimately lead to devastating '
            'incidences of pregnancy complications and baby loss.” Dr '
            'Christine Ekechi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and '
            'co-chair of RCOG’s race equality taskforce, said the disparities '
            'were heartbreaking. “These women are being let down by a '
            'healthcare system that is supposed to protect them. Reducing the '
            'occurrence of potentially avoidable adverse pregnancy outcomes '
            'needs to be a national priority,” she said.',

{'article': 'The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has accused Scott Morrison '
            'of lying over the submarines deal, prompting the Australian prime '
            'minister to launch a furious rebuttal of what he called “slurs” '
            'and “sledging”. Let’s take a look beneath the soundbites to try '
            'to find out what on earth has happened. Why is Macron so upset? '
            'First, the basics. The French contract with Australia to provide '
            '12 conventionally powered submarines has been a big deal for '
            'France – financially and strategically – since it was initiated '
            'in 2016. The total value of the submarine project was estimated '
            'at almost $A90bn (although that figure includes all spending '
            'associated with it).\n'
            'So it is only natural that a French president would be upset when '
            'Australia revealed it had decided to scrap the contract and would '
            'instead partner with the US and the UK to acquire at least eight '
            'nuclear-powered submarines (pending an 18-month study). That’s a '
            'big loss, but is there another reason France reacted so strongly? '
            'Yes. The French government has taken exception to the manner in '
            'which the Aukus partnership was negotiated in secret, claiming it '
            'was “stabbed in the back” in the process and disrespected as a '
            'close partner. It has argued it was told only at the 11th hour '
            'with no genuine opportunity for consultation. One of the '
            'encounters of most contention is Morrison’s meeting and dinner '
            'with Macron at the Élysée Palace in Paris in June. What do we '
            'know about Morrison and Macron’s talks in Paris? Morrison went to '
            'Paris just days after Morrison had his own trilateral meeting '
            'with Joe Biden and Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the G7 '
            'summit in Carbis Bay in the UK. (We now know the leaders of '
            'Australia, the US and the UK were talking about what would later '
            'become the Aukus arrangement.) We know that Australia’s concerns '
            'about the submarine programme were discussed between Morrison and '
            'Macron. Both sides also agree that Morrison raised concern over '
            'the deteriorating strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific '
            'region. But the two sides have different interpretations of what '
            'flowed from that. The French ambassador, Jean-Pierre Thébault, '
            'has previously told Guardian Australia that this wasn’t meant to '
            'be the end of the conversation: “The prime minister, to our '
            'understanding, signalled that there were questions raised about '
            'the evolving situation in the region … but what was agreed is '
            'that this conversation would continue.” Here’s the account '
            'provided by Morrison when speaking to reporters in Glasgow on '
            'Monday: “Now, at that point, I made it very clear that a '
            'conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet '
            'Australia’s strategic requirements. We discussed that candidly.” '
            'But Morrison told reporters it was not up to him to flag the '
            'emerging plan B (the US- and UK-backed nuclear-propelled '
            'submarines) at that stage: “I did not discuss what other '
            'alternatives we were looking at. They were in confidence, and '
            'they were subject to the security arrangements we had about those '
            'other discussions.”\n'
            'Did Morrison give any hint of abandoning the French deal in June? '
            'With the benefit of hindsight, maybe a little hint. Speaking to '
            'reporters shortly after the meeting in Paris in June, Morrison '
            'did not rule out walking away from the project when the next '
            'contractual milestone was reached, but he also appeared to imply '
            'the sticking points were being resolved. Morrison said he '
            'appreciated the French president was “taking a very active role” '
            'in resolving issues with the contract. “President Macron and I '
            'have a very, very open and very transparent, and very friendly '
            'relationship where we can speak candidly to each other about '
            'these issues,” Morrison said on 16 June.\n'
            'Asked whether he was leaving Paris more or less confident about '
            'the submarine program, Morrison said: “I leave knowing that we '
            'have properly raised the challenges that we need to address, and '
            'so it is now for us to work forward on that basis.” What was '
            'going on behind the scenes? Morrison told reporters on Monday '
            'that the French defence system “flew into action” the day after '
            'the dinner at the Élysée to seek to address issues with the '
            'project – including sending a French admiral to Australia “to try '
            'and save the contract”. “So if there was no concern about the '
            'contract being under threat, Admiral Morio would never have come '
            'to Australia,” Morrison said. Morrison said the Australian '
            'government “eventually formed the view that we would agree to '
            'disagree” and that the French Attack class submarine “would not '
            'meet our requirements”.\n'
            'Has France raised any other complaints about the Australia’s '
            'openness? Yes. At the end of August, just two weeks before the '
            'Aukus announcement, Australian ministers Marise Payne and Peter '
            'Dutton met by video link with their French counterparts to herald '
            'ever-strengthening ties (it was the first ever “2+2” meeting '
            'between the two sides). According to the official joint statement '
            '– which were obviously agreed by France and Australia - the four '
            'ministers “underlined the importance of the future submarine '
            'program”. Thebault, the French ambassador, has said it’s now '
            'apparent there was “no sincerity in the discussion”. What about '
            'the letter Australia sent hours before Aukus was announced? '
            'France complained that one of the reasons it felt blindsided was '
            'because hours earlier Australian officials had informed the '
            'French contractor of progress on the submarine contract. In the '
            'letter, sent on 15 September, the director general of the future '
            'submarine program confirmed the exit of a review of one aspect of '
            'the project “has been achieved as required under the Submarine '
            'Design Contract”. But the letter also included a caveat that the '
            '“matters addressed in this correspondence do not provide any '
            'authorisation to continue work”. At Senate estimates last week, '
            'the secretary of Australia’s defence department, Greg Moriarty, '
            'said there had been “a number of engagements with French '
            'officials about our thinking about capability requirements” but '
            'added: “I did not discuss cancellation of the Attack programme '
            'with any French official prior to the night before [the '
            'announcement].” Moriarty described the reaction of Naval Group '
            'when briefed hours later as follows: “They were surprised and '
            'disappointed – understandably.” How did a text message from '
            'Macron to Morrison get leaked? And what did it show? Hours before '
            'Morrison’s press conference hitting back at Macron on Monday, '
            'Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported on the contents of a text '
            'message the prime minister received from the French president two '
            'days before the Aukus announcement. By this account, Macron '
            'messaged Morrison to say he was not available at the time '
            'Australia had requested a call and wrote”: “Should I expect good '
            'or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?”\n'
            'When asked on Monday why a decision was made to release the text '
            'message, Morrison said: “I’m not going to indulge your editorial '
            'on it.” But Morrison added that the message “made it pretty clear '
            'that [Macron] was concerned” that the contract was to be '
            'cancelled. The release of the message appears to be designed to '
            'show the Aukus decision didn’t come out of the blue. But another '
            'reading of it is that Macron didn’t know – two days before – '
            'which way the Australian government was leaning. Morrison replied '
            'to Macron that it was important that the pair spoke. When a time '
            'couldn’t be locked in, Morrison said he texted a letter outlining '
            'the decision to Macron. What is being done to undo the damage? '
            'France is calling on the Australian government to propose '
            '“tangible actions” to heal the diplomatic rift. On Monday the '
            'Australian foreign minister met for more than an hour with the '
            'French ambassador to start the process – but that effort may be '
            'undercut by some senior members of the government who have played '
            'down the significance of Australia’s decision in theatrical '
            'terms, and now by Morrison’s strong pushback at Macron’s remarks.',

{'article': 'Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has delivered her strongest '
            'call yet for Mark Zuckerberg to step down as chief executive of '
            'his social media empire, saying the business will be better off '
            'with a leader who focuses on user safety. Frances Haugen said '
            'Facebook’s parent company, rebranded Meta last week, is unlikely '
            'to change if its founder remains in charge. Speaking at the Web '
            'Summit in Lisbon, the former Facebook employee, who has leaked '
            'tens of thousands of internal documents detailing the company’s '
            'struggles with user safety and misinformation, also criticised '
            'Zuckerberg’s “unconscionable” decision to invest in its metaverse '
            'concept instead of focusing on fixing its current problems. Asked '
            'if Zuckerberg should step down, Haugen said: “I think Facebook '
            'will be stronger with someone who is willing to focus on safety, '
            'so yes.” However, Haugen acknowledged that Zuckerberg’s control '
            'of Meta was an issue for any independent shareholders who might '
            'wish for a change at the top. Zuckerberg controls decision-making '
            'at the company through his majority ownership of the voting '
            'shares in Meta, which makes his position unassailable. “Mark '
            'holds 54% of the voting shares in Facebook. He is the chairman '
            'and the CEO and I think that at a minimum the shareholders have '
            'the right to actually choose their CEO. And so I think it is '
            'unlikely the company will change if he remains the CEO,” said '
            'Haugen. “And I hope that he can see that there is so much good he '
            'could do in the world, and maybe it’s a chance for someone else '
            'to maybe take the reins.” Haugen also criticised the strategic '
            'shift behind the company’s surprise rebranding last week, with '
            'Zuckerberg committing the business to a major investment in the '
            'metaverse, a space where digital representations of people – '
            'avatars – interact at work and play, meeting in their office, '
            'going to concerts and even trying on clothes.\n'
            'Haugen said the documents she had released to Congress, '
            'regulators and the press made clear that the company needed to '
            'spend more on basic safety systems and not an expansion into '
            'virtual reality. The documents released by Haugen have revealed '
            'that Meta was aware its Instagram photo-sharing app has been '
            'accused of exacerbating mental health problems for teenage girls, '
            'that its own workers were dismayed by a failure to stem '
            'misinformation spreading in the run-up to the 6 January riot in '
            'Washington, and that Facebook was helping to fan ethnic violence '
            'in Ethiopia. “I think there is a meta problem at Facebook which '
            'is that over and over again Facebook chooses expansion in new '
            'areas over sticking the landing on what they have already done '
            'and I find it unconscionable that, as you read through the '
            'documents, it states very clearly there needs to be more '
            'resources on very basic safety systems,” she said. Haugen added '
            'that her actions were driven by a belief that Facebook needed to '
            'change in order to save lives. “I genuinely believe that there '
            'are a million, or maybe 10 million lives on the line in the next '
            '20 years, and compared to that nothing really feels like a real '
            'consequence.” Haugen’s appearance at the Web Summit follows her '
            'testimonies at the US Congress and in Westminster last month. In '
            'London she told MPs and peers that urgent external regulation was '
            'needed to rein in the tech company’s management. Haugen was '
            'speaking at a joint committee scrutinising the draft online '
            'safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on social media '
            'companies to protect users from harmful content. Meta’s apps, '
            'including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, are used daily by 2.8 '
            'billion people. Responding to Haugen’s comments, a Meta '
            'spokesperson said: “The argument that we deliberately push '
            'content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical. '
            'We are on track to spend more than $5bn on safety and security in '
            '2021 – more than any other tech company – and have 40,000 people '
            'to do one job: keep people safe on our apps.” The spokeperson '
            'added that Meta was able to invest in expansion and safety at the '
            'same time. “Obviously, we can and must do both of these things at '
            'the same time – and we are.”',

{'article': 'At least $1.7bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous '
            'peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in recognition of their key '
            'role in protecting the planet’s lands and forests, it will be '
            'announced at Cop26 today. The governments of the UK, US, Germany, '
            'Norway and the Netherlands are leading the $1.7bn (£1.25bn) '
            'funding pledge, which is being announced as part of ambitious '
            'global efforts to reverse forest loss and land degradation by '
            '2030, with campaigners cautiously hopeful that this conference of '
            'the parties (Cop) could be the first to properly champion '
            'indigenous peoples’ rights. Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador’s '
            'indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the '
            'Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said: “We are happy '
            'with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for '
            'concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to '
            'transform a system that has directed less than 1% of climate '
            'funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what '
            'happens next. “This Cop is interesting and unprecedented,” he '
            'added. “After attending these climate events for years, this one '
            'is different. The UK has put tremendous effort into raising our '
            'visibility at this Cop. “But the UK is now at a crossroads: they '
            'can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to '
            'become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local '
            'communities.”\n'
            'As indigenous peoples have fought for their rights more publicly '
            'in recent years, they have faced increasing persecution. In 2020, '
            'a record number of people were killed for protecting their land, '
            'with more than a third from indigenous communities. Despite the '
            'important role they play in protecting forests, only a small '
            'fraction of these communities have secure rights to their land. '
            'The funding is recognition that IPLCs are crucial to protecting '
            'tropical forests and preserving ecosystems. Leaders will be '
            'calling on other countries to respect and protect these rights in '
            'accordance with national legislation. While the majority of the '
            'money in the fund will come from governments, charitable '
            'foundations including the Ford Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund, '
            'Bloomberg Philanthropies, Arcadia, Wyss Foundation and the '
            'Rainforest Trust are contributing more than $600m. Darren Walker, '
            'president of the Ford Foundation, said the aim was to give IPLCs '
            'more of a voice in policymaking and discourse. It is hoped more '
            'funding will follow. Walker said: “It’s a first step, it’s a down '
            'payment. We ignore these communities at our peril. We have to '
            'invest more, we have to support them more. “I’m not asserting '
            'that this is the only solution,” he added, “but it’s a critical '
            'part of the puzzle of solving climate change and this part of the '
            'puzzle needs to be resourced properly.” The money will support '
            'IPLCs’ capacity to govern themselves collectively, assist with '
            'mapping and registration work, back national land reform and help '
            'resolve conflict over territories. It will continue until 2025. '
            'Walker said: “We have been wedded to technical, market-based '
            'solutions, and have ignored the communities right in front of us '
            'who are key to solving the challenge. “This is an historic '
            'moment. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the '
            'paradigm and to at last give power and a seat at the table to the '
            'people who are critical to the solution. A new paradigm is '
            'emerging and we will hear it loud and clear in Glasgow.” The '
            'announcement follows a number of studies that show securing '
            'indigenous rights and land tenure is an effective way of '
            'protecting the environment. A 2021 UN review of more than 300 '
            'studies found that deforestation rates in South America were up '
            'to 50% lower within areas under indigenous control than '
            'elsewhere. It follows an emphasis on including indigenous voices '
            'at the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference '
            'in Marseille in September. For the first time in its seven-decade '
            'history, the IUCN included indigenous peoples as full voting '
            'members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category.\n'
            'Paul Redman, founder of If Not Us Then Who?, a US charity that '
            'highlights the role indigenous and local peoples play in '
            'environmentalism, said: “I think it’s the first time in all the '
            'climate conferences I’ve been to since 2013 that leaders really '
            'seem to be genuinely engaged and wanting indigenous peoples to be '
            'at the table. “The real key is follow-up: money going to '
            'indigenous communities and land titles being allocated to '
            'indigenous peoples post-Cop.”\n',

            'failed to step up. On a day devoted to speeches by presidents and '
            'prime ministers that underlined the scale of the challenges '
            'ahead, Johnson said future generations “will judge us with '
            'bitterness” if the conference fails. Other key moments included:\n'
            '• India pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Although it '
            'is the first time the world’s third biggest polluter has set this '
            'target, and experts said it was a realistic commitment, it is 20 '
            'years behind the 2050 date set agreed by other developed '
            'countries. • President Biden warned that greater urgency was '
            'needed at the talks: “Right now, we are falling short. There’s no '
            'time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves.” '
            '• António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said the world was '
            'being driven to the brink by an addiction to fossil fuels. “We '
            'are fast approaching tipping points that will trigger escalating '
            'feedback loops of global heating,” he warned. • In a recorded '
            'message, the Queen called on leaders to “rise above the politics '
            'of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship”. She added: “Of '
            'course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy '
            'for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. But we '
            'are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our '
            'children’s children, and those who will follow in their '
            'footsteps.” Following his own speech, Johnson provoked some '
            'ridicule by admitting he would fly home rather than take the '
            'train.\n'
            'Shortly before, he had told a roundtable of leaders of developing '
            'nations: “When it comes to tackling climate change, words without '
            'action, without deeds are absolutely pointless.” The commitments '
            'on deforestation are an early win for the UK, which as host '
            'nation bears responsibility for forging a consensus among the '
            'nearly 200 countries present, amid concerns that an overall '
            'commitment on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the 45% '
            'scientists say is needed this decade will fall short. The '
            'political declaration, which is voluntary and not part of the '
            'Paris process, is one of a range of side deals that the UK '
            'presidency is pushing for at the climate summit in Glasgow '
            'alongside others on methane, cars and coal. The package includes '
            '£5.3bn of new private finance and £8.75bn of public funding for '
            'restoring degraded land, supporting indigenous communities, '
            'protecting forests and mitigating wildfire damage. A pledge from '
            'CEOs to eliminate activities linked to deforestation, and £1.5bn '
            'funding from the UK government for forests, are also part of the '
            'deal. £350m of that will go to Indonesia and £200m to the Congo '
            'basin, with a new £1.1bn fund for the west African rainforest. '
            'While the forestry agreement has been cautiously welcomed by '
            'ecologists and forest governance experts, they point to previous '
            'deals to save forests that have so far failed to stop their '
            'destruction, including in 2014. But this time, the EU, China and '
            'the US alongside major forested countries like Brazil, the '
            'Democratic Republic of the Congo and Papua New Guinea will all '
            'sign the commitment. Many details need to be clarified, '
            'particularly how the money is spent, according to Carlos Rittl, '
            'who works on Brazil for the Rainforest Foundation Norway. “Big '
            'cheques won’t save the forests if the money doesn’t go into the '
            'right hands,” he said, emphasising that it should go to '
            'indigenous groups and others who are committed to protecting the '
            'forest. In a separate announcement, at least £1.25bn of funding '
            'will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local '
            'communities by governments and philanthropists for their role in '
            'protecting forests. But the promised funds still fall far short '
            'of what some believe is needed. “We are undervalued and our '
            'rights are still not respected,” said Mina Setra, an indigenous '
            'rights activist from Borneo. “A statement is not enough. We need '
            'evidence, not only words.”\n',

            'from health and aged care workers, teachers and police to '
            'construction and hospitality workers. On some job boards, '
            'businesses that are happy to accept unvaccinated people advertise '

            'and accountants are among 20,000 people who are members of the '

            'Ash Heap is an electrician from Geelong who refuses to get '
            'vaccinated. “I’m left in a position where I’ve lost my career of '
            '20 years,” he said. “I don’t really have a lot of options. I was '
            'given a small business grant which will see me through for '
            'another month but there’s no income.” He owns a house with his '
            'partner, who also looks set to lose her job. The pair are hoping '
            'the mandate will be dropped. “We’ll probably have to rent the '
            'house and find work anywhere, doing cash jobs, doing whatever.” '
            'Each state and territory has implemented its own rules on '
            'mandates. Victoria has one of the most wide-ranging vaccine '
            'mandates, which came into effect last month and covers about 1.25 '
            'million people. Last week Western Australia announced it would '
            'roll out a mandate across multiple industries, including teachers '
            'and supermarket staff, representing 75% of the state’s workforce. '
            'New South Wales has a mandate in place for some sectors but from '
            '1 December is set to allow the same freedoms for unvaccinated '
            'citizens, bar international travel. The mandate for high-risk '
            'workers will remain in place. Julian Melvin has been sifting '
            'through jobs ads since he lost his work as an arborist because he '
            'won’t get the vaccine. He says mainly odd jobs are on offer. “A '
            'lot of them it’s like ‘I need my lawns mowed’ … cash work here '
            'and there,” he said. “There are some businesses saying we’ll '
            'employ you but how many people are unemployed versus how many '
            'people need work?” According to the latest data from the '
            'Melbourne Institute, vaccine hesitancy across Australia has been '
            'steadily falling from a peak of 33% in May, to 11.8% on 21 '
            'October. Hesitancy remained the highest in South Australia '
            '(17.9%) followed by Queensland (16.4%) and WA (15.6%). Vaccine '
            'hesitancy was much lower in Victoria (8.2%) and in NSW (10%), as '
            'well as in the other smaller states and territories (8.4% in the '
            'Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and the Northern Territory '
            'combined). More than 90% of people aged 16 and over in NSW, '

            'managing principal of FCW Lawyers, Andrew Douglas, said if an '
            'industry fell under a government mandate, it was not possible to '
            'challenge it. But some employees were arguing they can work from '
            'home to avoid having to comply. “We’re starting to see a lot of '
            'people going, ‘I can work from home,’” Douglas said. “We’re '
            'starting to see a lot of people bring medical evidence.” At the '

            'their own Covid jab mandate to avoid losing clients. “We’re now '
            'starting to get employers who are saying we’ve got a problem, no '

            'The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, '
            'Paul Guerra, said one of the biggest challenges was the risk of '
            'businesses losing staff. “It is up to the individual and their '
            'employer whether work can be adapted to be done at home,” Guerra '
            'said. “After two long, hard years for Victorian businesses, our '
            'primary concern right now is getting back up and running and '
            'having a bumper summer trading period.” Another emerging issue '
            'for employees who are vaccinated is whether they feel safe '
            'working alongside those who have not got the jab, said an '
            'associate lecturer in law at Monash University, Liam Elphick. '
            '“Employers have obligations under work safety laws to prevent '
            'against workplace risk, not just address it when it happens,” '
            'Elphick said. Covid safety was likely to become “the main arena” '
            'of disputes going forward, he said, as vaccinated employees made '
            'sure all the necessary checks and balances, including vaccines, '
            'were put in place. “Anyone has the ability to raise concerns '
            'about an unsafe workplace,” he said.',

            'recent monologue about him. As for the vexed question of his '

            'drawing board. The next phase of the propaganda campaign was the '
            'siblings doing stage-managed interviews, “sharing memories and '
            'feelings about their dad”. Good luck with that. Meanwhile, the '
            'FBI wanted to serve subpoena documents but Logan told them to '
            '“fuck off”. Gerri counselled him to co-operate ahead of the '
            'upcoming shareholder vote. Nope, still “fuck off”. Well, he’s got '
            'a catchphrase hasn’t he. Greg was being bullied from both sides '
            'Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) was trying to straddle both sides of '

            'Except there were crossed wires. He was merely “hooking Greg up” '

            'asked him not to scare the horses ahead of next week’s '
            'shareholder vote, assuring him they had the same aim: fix the '
            'company from the inside. Still high on his messiah complex, '
            'Kendall smirked: “He made you get all dressed up for this? I’m '
            'sorry for you, Siobhan.” She was now the one doing daddy’s '
            'bidding. As he gloated, she glowered. When she reported back, '
            'Logan wanted his only daughter to help rehabilitate his image by '
            'declaring he “isn’t some dirty old man”. Cue a wary exchange '
            'where Shiv gave a deeply unconvincing answer to “Do you trust '
            'me?”. She knew about criminality in the cruise division from Tom '
            'but Logan played it down, promising he could handle it. Did his '
            'political influence extend to the law? Wambsgans the sacrificial '
            'lamb Drunk and maudlin after a lawyer meeting, Tom seemed certain '
            'he was jail-bound for his part in the cruise cover-up. Ever '
            'ambitious, he hatched a plan with Shiv to “find some benefit” in '
            'his predicament by going to Logan and offering himself as a '
            'sacrifice. All heart, Shiv demurred for all of 10 seconds before '
            'admitting the idea was “kind of genius” because “either way, you '
            'bank gold with my dad”. In a whispered conversation at ATN, Tom '
            'offered to be the fall guy. “I’ll step up and go down,” he vowed. '
            'Logan looked bewildered by the fact that his son-in-law didn’t '
            'want anything in return. Oh, Tom. He can’t even play the hero '
            'properly. Kendall v Shiv: round 2\n'
            'Against advice, Kendall headed into the office to “send '
            'shockwaves” and not let “dad dominate the battle space”. Panic '
            'stations ensued, with staff scrambling as Kendall – key card '
            'revoked – tried to gain access to the building. Kendall’s tense '
            'progress through the office included greeting a mailroom worker '
            'with “Wassup bro, doing the heavy lifting?” and a stilted chat '
            'with Tom, telling him “Another life is possible”. When Kendall '
            'sent his sidekick out with a shopping list, we knew something was '
            'afoot. At the town hall, Shiv addressed employees about '
            '“corporate responsibility”. “We get it,” she said (cut to Hugo '
            'looking proud). However, her smooth speech was soon drowned out '
            'by Rape Me by Nirvana blaring from speakers placed on balconies '
            'around the atrium. As security struggled to turn the music off, '
            'Shiv was forced to abandon her speech. Even more embarrassingly, '
            'the shambles was being live-streamed to Waystar offices '
            'worldwide. Incandescent with icy fury, Shiv marched into '
            'Kendall’s office, saw the empty speaker boxes and proceeded to '
            'viciously spit into her brother’s notebook. A stunt from their '
            'school days, maybe. Now it meant war. Kendall v Shiv: round 3 '
            'Backstage at The Disruption, Kendall was running through the '
            'jokes he’d had scripted for him. In an excruciating scene, he '
            'gatecrashed the writers’ room, telling them “Hurt me, I can take '
            'it”. Can you, though, Ken? Minutes before he was due on-air, Shiv '
            'delivered her killer blow. In a faux-concerned open letter, she '
            'questioned Kendall’s mental health, calling him “a drug addict, '
            'serial liar and absentee father with a history of problematic '
            'relationships with women”. It was so brutal, brothers Roman and '
            'Connor (Alan Ruck) had refused to co-sign it. A quietly '
            'devastating 90-second sequence saw Kendall walk off down the '
            'corridor of the TV studio, his face falling from false grin to '
            'haunted despair, still clutching those cue cards as he slumped to '
            'the floor in a server room and watched Iwobi “empty chair” him '
            'on-screen. A bravura performance from Jeremy Strong, beautifully '
            'soundtracked by Nicholas Britell. ‘Open up. Let them in. We’re '
            'cooperating’\n'
            'Roman could barely conceal his boredom during his interview with '
            'ATN Business, but waxed lyrical about a fly fishing trip to '
            'Montana with his father. Heartbreakingly, this turned out to be a '
            'repurposed “multi-use happy childhood memory” – Connor had '
            'actually taken him. What’s more, the old man rubbed Roman’s nose '
            'in it, cruelly sneering: “Aww, I wuv my daddy. I never figured '
            'you for a faggot.” This dysfunctional family tableau was '
            'interrupted by 20 FBI agents storming the building. Logan issued '
            'his usual response, only for Gerri to tell him: “These are the '
            'ones who don’t fuck off. This is a search warrant.” Not only had '
            'the deputy attorney-general been spooked by Logan’s shady pow-wow '
            'with senior White House aide Michelle-Anne Vanderhoven (Linda '
            'Emond) but Kendall told his lawyer to push for a raid to show '
            '“the government’s not gone soft-cock on big corp”. With cameras '
            'outside, it wasn’t wise to resist. Looking defeated and suddenly '
            'old – like in Sarajevo – Logan finally relented. Across town, '
            'Kendall watched the raid footage on his phone with the glimmer of '
            'a grin. The heir apparent Still Shiv – but only just. Logan put '
            'Gerri in place for “optics” and wanted to keep Shiv clean because '
            'she was the long-term successor. But with Feds kicking the door '
            'down and hostile investors hovering, how long will it be Logan’s '
            'decision to make? Line of the week Sophie Iwobi’s string of '
            'nicknames for Kendall: “Oedipussy, Wokestar Royco, Paranoid '
            'Kendroid, Benedickhead Arnold, Snitchie Rich, a jar of mayonnaise '
            'in a Prada suit …” Oof. Notes and observations This cracking '
            'episode was directed by Cathy Yan, whose credits include DC’s '
            'Harley Quinn film Birds of Prey, making her the first Asian woman '
            '(and only the second woman full stop) to helm a superhero movie. '
            'In that stretch limo with champagne on tap, naturally Kendall and '
            'his crew were listening to Money All the Time by Balance. Shiv '
            'and Tom’s pantyhose-eating pet pooch was named Mondale, after '
            'Democratic politician Walter Mondale who died in April. Perhaps '

{'article': 'On the night when Wolves fans chanted “Bruno, Bruno” on the final '
            'whistle to indicate their new manager Bruno Lage is definitely '
            'proving more of a success at his new club than his predecessor '
            'Nuno Espírito Santo has been at Tottenham Hotspur, the mantle as '
            'the Premier League’s most under-pressure manager is now heading '
            'towards Rafael Benítez.\n'
            'Everton were woeful in a first half when Max Kilman scored his '
            'first Premier League goal before Raúl Jiménez hit his first at '
            'Molineux in over a year. Even if Alex Iwobi’s strike early in the '
            'second half presaged a spirited rally, this is an alarming slump '
            'for a team who had lost only one of their opening seven games. '
            'Never had a Benítez team conceded five goals in a Premier League '
            'game before the collapse against Watford a week last Saturday and '
            'at half-time at Molineux there was the serious possibility of a '
            'repeat. Wolves were slicing with ease through a midfield in which '
            'Jean-Philippe Gbamin, the £25m signing from Mainz, was suffering '
            'his own belated Halloween nightmare. He was replaced by Fabian '
            'Delph at half-time. On the day Nuno was dismissed just 10 league '
            'games into his reign at White Hart Lane, there could be question '
            'marks over the stability of Benítez’s tenure. When the new '
            'Everton manager claimed that “we are missing something” it needed '
            'clarifying that he meant “not only one or two but three or four '
            'important” players through injury rather than something more '
            'integral such as spirit or tactical confidence. Both were '
            'severely lacking in the first half. Without Dominic '
            'Calvert-Lewin, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes, '
            'Everton were indeed missing an important spine and the impact '
            'Delph had in the second half, despite not being match fit, backed '
            'up Benítez’s stance. “You can see he can take the ball, pass the '
            'ball, bring players around him into the game and win the second '
            'balls.\n'
            '“The character and mentality of this squad is to fight, as they '
            'showed in the second half.” Benítez admitted that he was '
            '“surprised” by his side’s first-half inferiority when Wolves '
            'managed to combine the best of their early-season form with the '
            'goals they lacked in those three opening defeats. They have now '
            'gained 13 points from a possible 15 with Jiménez back to his '
            'rampant best, leading the press from the front that enables '
            'Lage’s game plan to work at its best. Rúben Neves is also back in '
            'his pomp and, restored to the starting lineup, he dispatched a '
            'fulsome volley from the edge of the area that was brilliantly '
            'parried by Jordan Pickford, who also tipped over Francisco '
            'Trincão’s shot.\n'
            'Hwang Hee-Chan had a goal disallowed for offside but broke '
            'through after another run of conviction by Jiménez earned a '
            'corner which Rayan Ait-Nouri dispatched for Kilman to head home. '
            'Four minutes later Jiménez was sharp again, reacting quickest to '
            'Ben Godfrey’s backpass that was vaguely towards Pickford. Clean '
            'through, the Mexican dinked a sumptuous shot over the keeper for '
            'his 50th goal for the club, after nine months out with a '
            'fractured skull.\n'
            'Everton switched to 4-3-3, in a bid to stem the flood, and they '
            'got their first sniff of goal when Romain Saïss sliced an '
            'attempted clearance to offer Demarai Gray a great chance but the '
            'in-form forward fired well wide. After the interval it was a much '
            'closer affair. Conor Coady injured himself in blocking '
            'Richarlison from what appeared a certain goal after José Sá, '
            'receiving a routine back pass, inexplicably played the ball '
            'straight to the Brazilian forward inside the six-yard box. Having '
            'taken heart, the visiting team were able to play higher up the '
            'field, penning Wolves back. Godfrey, coming inside, shot low and '
            'Iwobi converted a rebound from Coady’s block. Game on. Wolves '
            'finally came back out of retreat and should have made the game '
            'safe. Hee-Chan Hwang laid the ball off for Trincão to jink inside '
            'but shoot wide before Jiménez headed against a post. Everton kept '
            'pushing for the equaliser, Sá tipping the substitute Anthony '
            'Gordon’s header to safety, but after that shocking first half, '
            'Wolves deserved the win that takes them seventh.',

{'article': 'Joanna Lumley and the Human Swan is a title that could only fly '
            '(sorry) in England. At a time when we are all looking for gentle, '
            'non-toxic ways to define ourselves, let us seize upon ITV’s '
            'eco-minded documentary. And, of course, on Joanna Lumley herself. '
            '(Not that way, Purdey-people. Behave yourselves.) Everything '
            'about Lumley is old-fashioned in the best way. The charm, the '
            'elegance, the grace. The wit and the bone-deep confidence. It is '
            'all redolent of a slower, calmer era. She glides serenely through '
            'her presenting duties in the likes of Joanna Lumley’s Postcards '
            'and Silk Road Adventure, reminding us all – even those of us too '
            'young to have any recollection of them – of the days when the '
            'world seemed full of wonder, instead of the absolute shambles of '
            'today. It is this charm that makes her the ideal choice of travel '
            'companion for biologist and conservationist Sacha Dench’s (AKA '
            '“the Human Swan”) 3,000 mile trip around Britain by eco-conscious '
            'paramotor. The pair travel the nation, meeting people tackling '
            'the climate emergency, with Dench due to continue on to the Cop26 '
            'summit to call attention not just to the current crisis but to '
            'the solutions that are possible. Dench got her nickname when she '
            'took to her paramotor (a kind of hang-glider with a rechargeable '
            'battery) and accompanied a flock of critically endangered '
            'Bewick’s swans along their entire three-month-long migration path '
            'from freezing Arctic Russia to France. Her mission? To show how '
            'and why their numbers have fallen so sharply, and call for '
            'conservation action along the flyway to protect the remaining '
            'birds. Lumley joins Dench as she and her flight partner Dan '
            'Burton prepare to take off from North Ayrshire and begin the '
            'battery-powered circumnavigation of our septic isle. Lumley '
            'follows Dench’s instructions on how to hoist the parachute that '
            'will help give her lift-off. “Be near me forever, Sacha,” says '
            'Lumley as she yanks on the strangely fearsome-looking equipment. '
            'Then Dench is, literally, off and running. Or, absolutely '
            'literally, running and then off, riding the thermals and making '
            'her way down the west coast and next meeting Lumley at Swansea '
            'Bay. There they are shown the suffering of the kittiwake, a small '
            'gull whose population has declined by 40% since the 1970s, thanks '
            'to climate change that causes storms that disturb the surface '
            'water and leaves them unable to see and catch fish. Warming '
            'oceans also affect the breeding of the sand eels upon which '
            'chicks depend for food, causing further problems. And so on and '
            'so on, each little change rolling into another until – to use '
            'entirely the wrong metaphor in a paragraph about global heating – '
            'we snowball into catastrophe. But then we meet Natasha Jenkins, '
            'also of Swansea, who got so sick of seeing so much of the waste '
            'humanity’s insanity creates every year washing up on their local '
            'shore that she set up the anti-litter campaign Don’t Be a Tosser '
            'on social media. There are now hundreds of litter-picking '
            'volunteers who go out in groups and make – literally again, as '
            'they stuff other people’s crap into sacks – bags of difference to '
            'their environment. On we go, round the coastline, having bad news '
            'broken to us gently and then good ideas proffered with '
            'ever-charming, seemingly genuine enthusiasm by the ever-charming '
            'and seemingly genuine Lumley. “Listen!” she confides urgently yet '
            'ebulliently to the camera, “we can ALL do this!” A visit to '

            'argue that the time for individual action diverting us from the '
            'path of destruction is long past, but what good does the counsel '
            'of despair ever do? Will more politicians be moved to more action '
            'by pressure from engaged citizens or from those sitting silently '
            'frozen in fear? The programme is bookended by the awful news that '
            'Burton and Dench suffered an air collision towards the end of '
            'their trip in which Burton was killed and Dench seriously '
            'injured. She and Burton’s family wanted the programme to be '

{'article': 'Yorkshire County Cricket Club are institutionally racist. There: '
            'that wasn’t so hard, was it? For years Yorkshire enabled, '
            'tolerated and normalised a dressing-room culture of racist '
            'discourse. They failed to create a welcoming environment for '
            'Muslims and other ethnic minorities. They continued and continue '
            'to employ staff who have made racist comments. When a former '
            'player raised serious allegations of longstanding racist '
            'behaviour three years ago, the club initially did nothing and '
            'then reportedly offered him a six-figure payout to keep quiet. '
            'Under investigation, they have chosen at every turn to prioritise '
            'their own reputation and their own people. It is true that an '
            'investigative panel found that Azeem Rafiq’s exclusion from the '
            'team was based on his cricket, and not his race. It is also true '
            'the panel may not have found sufficient evidence to conclude that '
            'Yorkshire are institutionally racist. But frankly, to me, to draw '
            'any other conclusion is not simply a refutation of the available '
            'evidence but a form of moral cowardice.\n'
            'So far, so cathartic. For all the comic ineptitude and farcical '
            'missteps Yorkshire have displayed in the handling of their racism '
            'investigation, anger remains the prevailing emotion here: anger '
            'at how long all this has taken, anger at the stories that have '
            'emerged so far, anger at the culture of shameless corporate '
            'self-interest that infects so much of this country’s executive '
            'class. Above all, you feel angry on behalf of Rafiq, a man who '
            'just wanted to bowl some off-spin and win some cricket games for '
            'Yorkshire, and who instead has found himself co-opted into a '
            'cruel fight for justice that has robbed him of his time and his '
            'joy, his human complexity, his dignity and occasionally his '
            'sanity. One of the hallmarks of this episode is that every time '
            'you feel Yorkshire have plumbed their own capacity for moral '
            'decrepitude, they somehow manage to drill even lower. Monday '
            'morning was another such moment: according to ESPNCricinfo, a '
            'current senior Yorkshire player admitted regularly addressing '
            'Rafiq using the P-word, but was cleared by the investigation of '
            'wrongdoing on the basis that it was “not reasonable for Azeem to '
            'have been offended”. Such words, the panel argued, fell under the '
            'banner of “good-natured banter between friends”. If these latest '
            'revelations teach us anything, it is that the report commissioned '
            'by Yorkshire almost 14 months ago, dragged through a mangle of '
            'delays and obfuscations, and released (in summary) during the '
            'chaotic cancellation of the fifth Test between England and India, '
            'is barely worth the USB drive it was uploaded to. Key figures '
            'were not interviewed. Since Rafiq first went public with his '
            'testimony in a wisden.com interview in August 2020 – an account '
            'backed up by numerous former teammates and staff – the Yorkshire '
            'chairman, Roger Hutton, has not given a single public interview.\n'
            'The sadness is that there are plenty of decent, principled, '
            'appalled people still working at Yorkshire today, but very few of '
            'them are in positions of real power. According to the Yorkshire '
            'Post some senior figures at the club are disgruntled it has not '
            'taken a more hostile line against Rafiq. This is a good example '
            'of how the struggle against racism is part of a broader fight '
            'against entitlement and entrenched privilege, be it through '
            'status or wealth or gender or connections. The point being: all '
            'this goes far deeper than simple acts of racist abuse, what words '
            'we deem acceptable or not or the futures of individuals. This is '
            'about how institutions protect themselves and resist change, '
            'about where power lies in our game and how it replicates.\n'
            'In 2003, when Darren Lehmann was banned for calling a Sri Lankan '
            'opponent a “black cunt” during a one-day international for '
            'Australia, his county, Yorkshire, refused to take any action. '
            '“You can’t say it was malicious, far from it,” said Colin Graves, '
            'the chairman at the time. “I’m disappointed the ICC has taken it '
            'down this route. He is not a racist.” Case closed; ancient '
            'history. Except Graves ended up running English cricket. Lehmann '
            'ended up coaching Deccan Chargers and Australia and this year was '
            'welcomed back to Headingley as coach of the Northern '
            'Superchargers in the Hundred. Imagine all the cricketers of '
            'colour who will have played under them, the staff who owed their '
            'livelihoods to them, the youngsters who went through the pathways '
            'they controlled. Imagine how little power they had and how much '
            'Graves and Lehmann enjoyed by comparison. That is institutional '
            'racism in action. Yorkshire acted shamefully, but they didn’t act '
            'alone. Senior white England players continue to avoid discussing '
            'racism out of squeamishness. The England and Wales Cricket Board, '
            'now making its own inquiries, spent years turning a blind eye to '
            'racism in the English game before finally deciding in 2020 there '
            'might be some good PR in all this George Floyd stuff. Even now, '
            'with its T-shirt gimmicks and a communications department bigger '
            'than many countries’ coaching staff, it gives the impression of a '
            'body less concerned with improving the game than with being able '
            'to say it has improved the game.\n'
            'As another month ticks by, Rafiq continues to wait for justice. '
            'He really was a very decent bowler in his prime, a clever spinner '
            'with subtle changes of flight and an underrated batting '
            'technique, an England Under-19s captain who with a little love '
            'and little luck could easily have developed into an international '
            'cricketer. He’s still only 30. And yet right now, his defining '
            'legacy in the game is as a victim of someone else’s racism. In a '
            'crowded field, that may well be the biggest injustice of all.',

{'article': 'Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking case will be '
            'permitted to use the words “victim” and “minor” in referencing '
            'accusers during her forthcoming trial in federal court in New '
            'York, it was ruled on Monday. Judge Alison Nathan’s decision '
            'permitting the use of “victim” stemmed from a challenge by '
            'Maxwell’s defense team, which had requested that the word be '
            'barred from the trial, due to begin in Manhattan this month. '
            'Nathan said: “Precluding the word is both unnecessary and '
            'impractical.” “It is appropriate to use the terms as '
            'representative of its litigation position,” Nathan said of the '
            'prosecution. This proceeding is only the second time that '
            'Maxwell, the British media heiress and former girlfriend of the '
            'late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has appeared in '
            'a courtroom in person for her case, amid restrictions relating to '
            'the coronavirus pandemic. Epstein killed himself in federal jail '
            'in New York in August 2019, while awaiting trial on sex '
            'trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy charges.\n'
            'The use of “victim” in criminal cases has drawn attention, '
            'especially given a recent decision in the Kyle Rittenhouse case '
            'in Wisconsin. Rittenhouse faces two homicide counts, and one '
            'attempted homicide count, in relation to shooting three people '
            'during protests in Kenosha last year after a white police officer '
            'wounded a local Black father, Jacob Blake. The judge in '
            'Rittenhouse’s trial, which began on Monday, created controversy '
            'when he ruled last week that prosecutors could not call those '
            'Rittenhouse shot “victims”, although the defense team could refer '
            'to them as “rioters” or “looters”. Prosecutors in Maxwell’s case '
            'had also asked for Nathan to let them use pseudonyms, or first '
            'names only, for some accusers and witnesses at trial, and the '
            'judge agreed. “Given the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the '
            'conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment and '
            'embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be '
            'deterred from coming forward,” Nathan explained. “Just because '
            'some victims’ names are publicly available does not mean that the '
            'details of their experiences are already available,” Nathan also '
            'said, noting that “alleged victims will testify in explicit '
            'detail” Maxwell is charged for allegedly procuring girls for '
            'Epstein to sexually abuse from 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors say that '
            'some of Maxwell’s victims were as young as 14. If convicted, she '
            'faces up to 80 years in federal prison. She has denied all the '
            'charges. On Monday, she appeared exhausted as she was led into '
            'court with handcuffs and ankle restraints, which were later '
            'removed. Federal prosecutors disclosed that they have not offered '
            'Maxwell a plea deal. Maxwell, 59, helped Epstein “recruit , '
            'groom, and ultimately abuse victims” whom they knew were minors, '
            'it is alleged. She also “first attempted to befriend some of '
            'Epstein’s minor victims prior to their abuse, including by asking '
            'the victims about their lives, their schools, and their families. '
            'Maxwell and Epstein would spend time building friendships with '
            'minor victims by, for example, taking minor victims to the movies '
            'or shopping,” prosecutors have said. “Some of these outings would '
            'involve Maxwell and Epstein spending time together with a minor '
            'victim, while some would involve Maxwell or Epstein spending time '
            'alone with a minor victim,” prosecutors said of the alleged '
            'grooming process, adding: “Having developed a rapport with a '
            'victim, Maxwell would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor '
            'victim … discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the '
            'victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or '
            'being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and '
            'Epstein.” Opening arguments are expected on 29 November.',

{'article': 'Mexican journalists have expressed alarm after two veteran '
            'reporters were attacked in their own homes in less than 24 hours, '
            'bringing this year’s death toll for media workers to nine – '
            'already surpassing the eight deaths recorded in 2020. Fredy López '
            'Arévalo, a veteran reporter in the southern state of Chiapas, was '
            'shot in the head inside his home in the city of San Cristóbal de '
            'las Casas on Thursday. López had covered Central American '
            'politics and the Zapatista uprising for news organisations such '
            'as Reuters, the Los Angeles Times and Notimex, and he still '
            'reported on the local political situation. On the same day, '
            'Acapulco journalist Alfredo Cardoso was pulled from his home by '
            'masked gunmen who also threatened his family. He was found the '
            'next day having been shot five times, and died from his injuries '
            'in hospital on Sunday, according to press freedom organization '
            'Reporters Without Borders. Cardoso previously worked as a '
            'photojournalist in Acapulco, a city which was once the jewel in '
            'the crown of Mexican tourist destinations but has been a hotbed '
            'of drug cartel violence for more than a decade. More recently he '
            'was the manager of the online news site Revista Dos Costas. “The '
            'situation for journalists in Acapulco and all of Guerrero [state] '
            'has worsened,” said Bernandino Hernández, a photojournalist in '
            'the coastal city. “Journalists have been threatened, some have '
            'had to flee. It’s a really dicey situation,” he said. No suspects '
            'have been arrested for either crime. Crimes committed against '
            'Mexican journalists almost always wallow in impunity – the '
            'product of inept and inadequate investigations, a lack of '
            'political will to stop the killings of media workers and frequent '
            'collusion between drug cartels. The two attacks reinforced '
            'Mexico’s reputation as the most murderous country for journalists '
            'in the hemisphere.\n'
            'The country’s murder rate has steadily risen since the then '
            'president Felipe Calderón declared a militarized crackdown on '
            'drug cartels in 2006. In the same period, attacks on journalists '
            'have also skyrocketed. Analysts say those most at risk are '
            'reporters who cover the intersection between local politics and '
            'the drugs trade. “These murders take place within a context of '
            'continuously deteriorating security in the country, for all '
            'citizens, but particularly for human rights defenders and '
            'journalists,” said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative for '
            'the Committee to Protect Journalists. “These attacks are fueled '
            'by impunity, which is almost complete in crimes against the '
            'press. The government of [President Andrés Manuel] López Obrador '
            'has been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to strengthen the '
            'justice state or protect journalists.” Mexico recorded 36,773 '
            'homicides in 2020, in spite of the pandemic and quarantines, '
            'according to the state statistics service INEGI – slightly higher '

{'article': 'France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has shelved his threat to '
            'clog up UK exports and ban its fishers from landing catches at '
            'French ports from midnight in a dispute over access to British '
            'fishing waters, as his deadline approached. Discussions resumed '
            'after a proposal was put forward by Macron’s government late on '
            'Monday. Downing Street had previously said it was bracing for '
            'Paris to deliver on its vow to retaliate over the issue of '
            'fishing permits. “Since this afternoon, discussions have resumed '
            'on the basis of a proposal I made to prime minister [Boris] '
            'Johnson. The talks need to continue,” Macron told reporters on '
            'the sidelines of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. “We’ll '
            'see where we are tomorrow at the end of the day, to see if things '
            'have really changed.” A UK government spokesperson said: “We '
            'welcome the French government’s announcement that they will not '
            'go ahead with implementing their proposed measures as planned '
            'tomorrow. As we have said consistently, we are ready to continue '
            'intensive discussions on fisheries … We welcome France’s '
            'acknowledgement that in-depth discussions are needed to resolve '
            'the range of difficulties in the UK-EU relationship.” France had '
            'been expected to impose extra customs checks and ban British '
            'fishing boats at some French ports from midnight. Official '
            'sources initially reported that neither side was backing down in '
            'the post-Brexit row. However, David Frost, the UK’s Brexit '
            'secretary, is to meet Clément Beaune, the French minister for EU '
            'affairs, in Paris on Thursday, to discuss possible ways out of '
            'the crisis. Beaune tweeted that he had already spoken to Frost on '
            'Monday and that he expected a response to Paris’s compromise '
            'proposal by Wednesday. He wrote that he looked forward to an '
            '“in-depth discussion” with Frost over the range of post-Brexit '
            'issues causing problems in the British-Franco relationship. '
            'France has been infuriated that some of its small boats are being '
            'denied permission to fish in the waters around the UK and Channel '
            'Islands. The UK insists its licensing regime is reasonable and it '
            'will continue to require boats to provide evidence that they have '
            'previously fished in those waters on at least four days in the '
            'last four years. Johnson and Macron had bumped fists as they '
            'arrived at the Cop26 summit on Monday. At a post-G20 press '
            'conference on Sunday, Macron initially insisted that Britain had '
            'to give ground or France would trigger trade reprisals this week. '
            '“The ball is in Britain’s court. If the British make no movement, '
            'the measures of 2 November will have to be put in place,” he '
            'said. But on Monday evening, the French president said he had '
            'pushed back the deadline by which Paris had said it would impose '
            'the new measures. Earlier in the day, Liz Truss, the UK foreign '
            'secretary, had told France it had 48 hours to back down on '
            'threats or Britain would begin dispute talks set out in the '
            'Brexit deal. A spokesman for Johnson suggested there would not be '
            'retaliatory UK trade measures, but action could be triggered '
            'through the dispute mechanism. “Depending on if, or what, the '
            'French decide to do, we will enact them as and when we need to,” '
            'he said. A meeting to find a compromise, organised by the '
            'European Commission with officials from the UK, Jersey and '
            'France, had initially been marked by a lack of movement by both '
            'sides on Monday, with sources describing the mood as sour. '
            'Jersey’s government was preparing to provide its fishers with '
            'financial support in the expectation that its vessels would not '
            'be able to land catches in French ports. The Jersey Fishermen’s '
            'Association (JFA) also called for the island’s authorities to '
            'respond in kind to the expected crisis by closing off the whelk '
            'and scallop fisheries to French vessels and banning dredging and '
            'trawling “with immediate effect for a period of six weeks”. The '
            'talks continued late into the evening, however. The diplomatic '
            'row over fishing, a very small sector of the UK economy, '
            'threatened to overshadow the G20 talks, which took place in Rome '
            'at the weekend, and also the Cop26 summit. Almost 1,700 EU '
            'vessels have been licensed to fish in UK waters, equating to 98% '
            'of EU applications for fishing licences, the UK government says, '
            'but this figure is disputed in Paris. The main area of '
            'disagreement is over the number of small French vessels given '
            'access to the immediate coastal waters of the UK and Jersey. On '
            'Monday evening, the UK government spokesperson said it would '
            'consider any new evidence to support the remaining licence '
            'applications.\n'
            'Truss had suggested on Monday that Macron may be making '
            '“unreasonable threats” because he has a difficult election '
            'looming. Asked about whether France and the UK had come to an '
            'agreement, she told Sky News: “The deal hasn’t been done. The '
            'French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to '
            'the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry and they need to '
            'withdraw those threats.” Asked why the row had emerged, she said: '
            '“You might say there’s a French election coming up.” Seeming '
            'angered by the dispute, she added: “I’m not remotely happy about '
            'what has happened.”',

{'article': 'The assistant director who handed Alec Baldwin a gun believed to '
            'contain a live bullet made his first comments on Monday about the '
            'movie set shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins '
            'last month. Dave Halls, in a statement to the New York Post, did '
            'not address the details of the incident, which occurred during '
            'filming of the desert western Rust last month near Santa Fe in '
            'New Mexico but said he was “shocked and saddened” at the death of '
            'Hutchins.\n'
            'According to court documents, Halls told Baldwin the gun was '
            '“cold” or safe when he handed it to him during a rehearsal on '
            'set, in costume. Halls was also quoted as telling Santa Fe '
            'sheriff’s department investigators that he did not thoroughly '
            'check the gun before handing it to Baldwin. Hutchins was shot and '
            'killed and director Joel Souza was wounded in the shoulder when '
            'the gun went off. Authorities in Santa Fe are investigating the '
            'incident, including how live rounds got onto the set, and say '
            'they have not ruled out criminal charges. “Halyna Hutchins was '
            'not just one of the most talented people I’ve worked with, but '
            'also a friend,” Halls said in the statement. “I’m shocked and '
            'saddened by her death,” he added. “It’s my hope that this tragedy '
            'prompts the industry to re-evaluate its values and practices to '
            'ensure no one is harmed through the creative process again.” The '
            'tragedy prompted questions about Halls’ conduct on the day and in '
            'some past productions when he was overseeing action on the set. '
            'But it also inflamed a wider debate about cost-cutting and safety '
            'in Hollywood, with crew members protesting conditions during the '
            'making of TV shows and feature films. Baldwin on Saturday said he '
            'would support limits on the use of real guns in films and '
            'television shows, and described Hutchins as a friend. “I’m not an '
            'expert in this field. So whatever other people decide is the best '
            'way to go, in terms of protecting people’s safety on film sets, '

            'made their way to Cop26 with a mission to save the planet. It was '
            'raining. There was no shelter. And the thousands of participants '
            'who had come to the UK from all four corners of the globe faced '
            'the mother of all queues to get inside. Welcome to Glasgow. This '
            'was not the most promising start for a conference seen by most '
            'observers as a last chance to save the world from climate change. '
            'But perhaps the wind and grey would help to focus minds on the '
            'task at hand.\n'
            'After all, the stakes have never been higher. The political '
            'leaders here all know that they’re on the hook. In the past they '
            'may have quibbled over the science, or questioned the figures. '
            'But this was a year in which the climate crisis came into more '
            'people’s lives than ever before. Many of their countries '
            'experienced record temperatures, wildfires, droughts and floods. '
            'Outside the conference, the demonstrators who chanted and sang '
            'were a constant reminder that there is a generation of people '
            'with a much clearer sense of what is going on – and a willingness '
            'to blame those who fail to assume responsibility and sort it out. '
            'In the pavilion, a makeshift village near the entrance to the '
            'site where NGOs, countries and corporations have set up pitches, '
            'there was a lifesize model of polar bears stuck on ice at the '
            'Tuvalu stand, and a sculpture of a penguin hanging itself. On '
            'every stand people were eager to talk and communicate the urgency '
            'they all felt. But it was in the blue zone, right at the centre '
            'of the conference, where the proper meetings would take place. '
            'And here, beyond the protesters and the queues and the polar '
            'bears, past the crowds of delegates with lanyards and briefcases, '
            'deep in the heart of the conference there was an undeniable sense '
            'of purpose as the leaders began their speeches and things finally '
            'got under way.\n'
            'What most of them would have made of Boris Johnson’s address is '
            'anyone’s guess. The host of the event, the ringmaster of this '
            'diplomatic circus, the UK prime minister started his speech '
            'talking about the city’s most famous fictional son: James Bond, '
            'likening the situation facing the world to a ticking timebomb. '
            '“We might not feel like James Bond, or look like James Bond, but '
            'Cop26 must be the start of defusing that bomb. Yes, it is going '
            'to be hard, but yes, we can do it,” he said. It was a step up, '
            'perhaps, from the speech he gave to the UN general assembly a '
            'month ago, in which he referenced the Muppets’ character, Kermit '
            'the Frog. It was the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Amor '
            'Mottley, who better captured the sense of urgency. She accused '
            'countries of making promises based on technology that still '
            'doesn’t exist. “This is at best reckless and at worst dangerous,” '
            'she said. “Our people are watching, and our people are taking '
            'note. And are we really going to leave Scotland without the '
            'resolve and the ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and '
            'to save our planet?” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, '
            'was emphatic too. “We are digging our own graves,” he said, as he '
            'urged G20 countries responsible for 80% of emissions to return to '
            'Cop every year with new commitments, rather than every five years '
            'as before. He also spoke about the importance of reaching the '
            '$100bn a year target promised in Paris in 2015. And he reminded '
            'those listening about the children, the next generation, who were '
            'watching. “The climate action army – led by young people – is '
            'unstoppable. They are larger. They are louder. And, I assure you, '
            'they are not going away,” he said. Once again, it was the veteran '
            'broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough, who somehow found the words '
            'that got delegates out of their seats. He told the conference '
            'that humans were the “greatest problem solvers to have ever '
            'existed on Earth”, and it not beyond the wit of man to “turn this '
            'tragedy into a triumph”. “We now understand this problem, we know '
            'how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse,” he said. '
            'Some of the most desperate calls for help came from poorer '
            'countries, many of whom have populations most at risk from '
            'escalating temperatures. Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi, from the Kingdom '
            'of Bhutan, who is chair of the least developed countries group at '
            'UN climate change negotiations, which represents the world’s '
            'poorest 48 nations, said “words alone are not enough”. “We cannot '
            'leave Glasgow without strong commitments that will ensure the '
            'survival of the billion people living in the [least developed '
            'countries].” Young Kenyan activist Elizabeth Wathuti closed this '
            'part of the ceremony. “I have seen with my own eyes three young '
            'children crying at the side of a dried-up river after walking 12 '
            'miles with their mother to find water,” she said. President Biden '
            'was one of a few delegates who appeared to nod off as the '
            'speeches went on. He showed up late after flying into Edinburgh '
            'earlier in the day and being driven to Glasgow in a motorcade. At '
            'least he got there, unlike veteran correspondent Wolf Blitzer '
            'from CNN who was sent to Edinburgh to report on the conference. '
            '“Should’ve gone to Glasgow,” said Specsavers’ Twitter account.',

{'article': 'A majority of the US supreme court appeared skeptical of a '
            'controversial Texas law that gives private citizens the right to '
            'file civil lawsuits to enforce a six-week abortion ban.\n'
            'The threat of expensive litigation posed by the ban has had a '
            'chilling effect and halted the vast majority of abortions in '
            'America’s second-largest state, which is home to more than 6 '
            'million women of child-bearing age. Over nearly three hours of '
            'arguments on Monday the nine-member bench heard from three '
            'parties: attorneys for Texas, the Biden administration and '
            'abortion providers. The focus of arguments was whether Texas can '
            'allow private citizens to enforce an abortion ban in direct '
            'contradiction of supreme court precedent in Roe v Wade, the 1973 '
            'ruling that provides a constitutional right to abortion up to '
            'roughly 24 weeks, and whether the federal government then has the '
            'standing to stop the law in court. Although laws deemed '
            'unconstitutional are often described as “struck down” by courts, '
            'in fact courts block specific officials from enforcing laws. '
            'Texas made it difficult for courts to scrutinize the law by '
            'making it difficult to identify who they would block from '
            'enforcing it, having, in the words of chief justice John Roberts '
            'last month, “delegated enforcement … to the populace at large”. '
            'This design by the Republican-led Texas legislature represented a '
            'purposeful effort to evade federal court scrutiny. While abortion '
            'was the constitutional right at issue, debate focused on the '
            'legality of the structure of Texas’s law, rather than the right '
            'to abortion. The court heard two separate challenges to the Texas '
            'law during oral arguments. Three liberal justices had already '
            'said they believed the law was unconstitutional. A fourth, the '
            'conservative Roberts, had said in the past he would have blocked '
            'the law while lower courts considered it. And two more justices, '
            'conservatives Amy Coney-Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, who both '
            'joined the bench during the Trump administration, had critical '
            'questions for attorneys representing Texas’s case. In separate '
            'suits, the Biden administration and abortion providers asked the '
            'court to block the law, claiming it is incompatible with Roe v '
            'Wade, caused ongoing and immediate harm to people in Texas '
            'seeking abortions, and was designed to evade court scrutiny in a '
            'way that threatened other constitutional rights. Attorneys for '
            'Texas argued abortion providers’ conflict was with Congress, and '
            'blocking courts from accepting lawsuits related to the law, known '
            'as SB8, threatened the US system of government. “It’s very '
            'difficult to find that relief, because Texas designed the law '
            'specifically to thwart it,” said the US solicitor general, '
            'Elizabeth Prelogar. “The clear purpose and actual effect [of the '
            'law] has been to chill the right” to abortion. Marc Hearron, '
            'attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, representing '
            'abortion providers in Texas, argued the court should enjoin Texas '
            'court clerks from docketing cases, arguing the threat of '
            'litigation was the very point of SB8. “This is a unique law '
            'created because the state has delegated enforcement and taken '
            'away the normal executive officials who would enforce, and has '
            'weaponized the court system,” Hearron said. SB8 is structured to '
            'favor plaintiffs in several ways. It provides plaintiffs a '
            '$10,000 fine for violations, plus attorney’s fees. Defendants, '
            'such as abortion providers, are not eligible for any such fees if '
            'a case is found to be frivolous. It also allows plaintiffs to sue '
            'in any county in Texas, which could force defendants into '
            'far-flung courts, and for multiple suits to be brought for the '
            'same alleged violation. Furthermore, it allows anyone to sue, not '
            'just people who might be somehow hurt by the abortion. Hearron '
            'argued this made anyone involved in providing abortions a '
            '“permanent defendant”. Later, he added: “The state has made the '
            'clerks an essential role in this machinery they have made.” Coney '
            'Barrett, who appeared skeptical of the enforcement mechanism, '
            'asked the Texas solicitor general, Judd E Stone II, whether '
            'abortion providers would need to bar citizens from suing '
            'one-by-one. “You cannot get global relief,” said Barrett. “It’s '
            'on an individual by individual basis.” Stone responded that '
            'Barrett was effectively correct: each individual citizen would '
            'need to be enjoined from enforcing the law. Justices then asked '
            'whether the attorney general of Texas could be enjoined, and thus '
            'block further lawsuits from being filed, on the basis that '
            'citizens were acting as private attorneys general. Stone said no. '
            '“He has none of those sort of mechanisms whatsoever,” said Stone, '
            'and added the state had “no authority” to stop private citizens’ '
            'suits. Another conservative on the bench, Brett Kavanaugh, said '
            'the Texas law “exploited” a loophole in court precedent '
            'concerning when state officials can be barred from enforcing '
            'unconstitutional laws. He wondered if the court should “close '
            'that loophole”. Elena Kagan, a liberal justice, sarcastically '
            'said the law was written by “some geniuses” to evade the broad '
            'legal principle that “states are not to nullify federal '
            'constitutional rights”. She argued that if Texas’s argument '
            'prevailed, states would be invited to nullify other rights in the '
            'same way. “Guns, same-sex marriage, religious rights, whatever '
            'you don’t like: go ahead.” Only two conservative justices, Samuel '
            'Alito and Neil Gorsuch, appeared moved by Texas’s arguments. '
            'Gorsuch suggested attorneys for reproductive rights groups were '
            '“line drawing” between the Texas law and others laws which '
            'constrain constitutional rights. The hearing came a month before '
            'arguably the most important abortion rights case in five decades: '
            'Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In that case, the '
            'court will consider whether Mississippi can ban nearly all '
            'abortion after 15 weeks, roughly nine weeks earlier than Roe v '
            'Wade permits. Both the court’s decision not to block Texas’s law '
            'and its acceptance of the Dobbs case are viewed as an ominous '
            'signs for the future of legal abortion in the US. Reuters '
            'contributed to this report',

{'article': 'Kate Barazetti, who has died aged 79, was a great humanitarian '
            'whose gift for friendship and hospitality spanned generational '
            'and social divides. A champion of race, gender and class '
            'equality, Kate really lived her beliefs by sharing her life with '
            'the most diverse group of individuals I have ever been part of. '
            'She was staunchly loyal to those she loved, caring and '
            'supportive. Her parents, Anna (nee Strassberger) and Bill '
            'Barazetti, had met as anti-Nazi activists in 1930s Germany, and '
            'Kate was the second of four children. Bill was later honoured for '
            'the role he played alongside Nicholas Winton in the evacuation of '
            'Jewish children from Prague. After many brushes with violence and '
            'death, the family ended up in Britain, and Kate was born in '
            'Stevenage railway station during a bombing raid. Bill got a job '
            'working nights at a printing press, and later with the trade '
            'union organisation PSI, but by all accounts family life continued '
            'in a chaotic and frightening way, until Anna kicked Kate out, '
            'aged 16, for being “rebellious”. Kate then moved to Israel with '
            'Mitch Burke – later her husband, and father to her children, '
            'Debbie and Jeremy. Her first job was at an Israeli bank, which '
            'gave her the book-keeping skills she used for much of her working '
            'life, enabling her to contribute to enterprises she supported, '
            'such as the Africa Centre in London, International PEN, City '
            'Limits magazine and Space Studios. After three years, Kate and '
            'Mitch returned to the UK. The marriage did not last, and Kate and '
            'the kids ended up living in a caravan in Weston-super-Mare, '
            'Somerset. Bill came to the rescue, inviting them to move into his '
            'work flat in St John’s Wood – he and Anna were by then living in '
            'Hornchurch, Essex. From this base, Kate began life as a London '
            'single parent, working multiple jobs. She forged a friendship '
            'with Robin Jones, a neighbour, and they finally became a couple '
            'in 1983. I met her in 1985, when I joined City Limits magazine as '
            'receptionist and she was working in the accounts department. She '
            'was fearless, forthright and funny, always finding ways to play '
            'the system and fight for the rights of those excluded or badly '
            'served by it. We hit it off instantly and, two years later, when '
            'I needed a temporary home for myself and my daughter Ava, she and '
            'Robin took us in. Kate and Robin threw the best parties: their '
            'Tuesday night dinners, monthly poker nights, summer and Xmas '
            'celebrations were legendary. They were the most generous and '
            'laidback hosts, always interested and entertained by their '
            'guests’ stories and observations on life. Great supporters of the '
            'arts, they filled their home with original works by artists who '
            'often became friends. In the 1990s Kate finally completed her '
            'education by doing a degree and master’s in gender studies at '
            'what is now Birkbeck, University of London. She went on to set up '
            'the feminist news website Aviva from her front room. Later she '
            'found her metier as a teacher, first of English to newly arrived '
            'refugees and then working on access to social science courses. '
            'She continued in this field well into her 70s. Robin died in '
            '2020. Kate is survived by her children and four grandchildren, '

{'article': 'The Guardian played a pivotal role in the life of the journalist '
            'and author Paul Reizin, who has died age 67 after a short '
            'illness. At the turn of the millennium, with the business of '
            'swiping right and left still some years ahead, Paul put his '
            'future happiness in the hands of the Guardian’s telephone dating '
            'line, through which he met his wife Ruth Webb, a distinguished '
            'classicist, for whom he was happy to abandon what Mrs Patrick '
            'Campbell called “the hurly-burly of the chaise-longue”. Not that '
            'the “hurly-burly” didn’t provide rich material for his writing, '
            'and he later recounted his experiences in Date Expectations '
            '(2005). I used to look forward to weekly emails chronicling some '
            'of these encounters: “You like a laugh, you’ll love Sally,” Paul '
            'was told, “She’s a riot.” “Yes, of the kind you want to quell '
            'with water cannon.” Paul and Ruth married and in 2002 their '
            'daughter Rachel was born, bringing late joy to Paul’s parents, '
            'Lev, a journalist in Warsaw, and Janka, Polish-Jewish Holocaust '
            'survivors who had met at a displaced persons camp in Rome after '
            'the second world war and later settled in London, where Paul, '
            'their only son, was born. Paul went to Christ’s college, '
            'Finchley, and graduated in psychology from Manchester University, '
            'before starting out as a reporter on the Wrexham Leader, then '
            'working at Radio Hallam in Sheffield, where I met him 43 years '
            'ago, and at LBC in London, in the pioneering days of commercial '
            'radio. His work as a television reporter and producer included a '
            'stint on TV-AM, the first commercial TV breakfast show, which '
            'launched in 1983 and where he did many of the funnies, basically '
            'as head of dressing up and delivering what he invariably called '
            '‘“spooky looks to camera”. Then came his career as a successful '
            'writer of funny and smart novels – Paul’s latest two books, '
            'Happiness for Humans (2018) and Ask Me Anything (2020), have been '
            'sold for film and TV. His association with the Guardian did not '
            'end with his marriage. Paul shared many of the paper’s values, '
            'but he also loved a joke, and took childish delight when he got a '
            'funny printed on the letters page. He would cut it out and pass '
            'it round to dining companions, of whom there was never any '
            'shortage, in his favourite Chinese restaurant in Soho. He was a '
            'best friend to me and countless others – warm, witty and generous '
            'with help and advice – which is why there was a constant stream '
            'of us into his flat in his final days. He began to show symptoms '
            'of mental and physical decline in April this year, and was '
            'diagnosed with suspected CJD. Paul was cared for by Ruth and '
            'Rachel, with extraordinary love and patience, as he became less '
            'and less responsive. He would have appreciated the irony in one '
            'of his favourite Woody Allen quotes: ‘I don’t mind dying, I just '
            'don’t want to be there when it happens,” because in many ways he '
            'wasn’t. Ruth and Rachel survive him.',

{'article': 'England took complete control of their group at the T20 World Cup '
            'on Monday night by beating Sri Lanka by 27 runs on a steamy, '
            'stressful night in Sharjah – an experience Jos Buttler declared '
            'would serve to make even stronger one of the two outstanding '
            'sides of the World Cup so far. “It was a great win for us as a '
            'team,” said Buttler, whose scintillating 67-ball century was '
            'instrumental in dragging the side to an ultimately match-winning '
            '163 for four.\n'
            '“The three matches before we’ve won the toss and done what we '
            'wanted to do. Today to be on the worse end of the conditions, to '
            'show the character we did as a side, one of our bowlers getting '
            'injured, guys having to step up and bowl overs at tough times – I '
            'think what that will do for us as a side is fantastic.” Tymal '
            'Mills pulled up with a right quad injury midway through his '
            'second over, forcing England to hurriedly rewrite their bowling '
            'plans. But it was a night for overcoming adversity, with Buttler '
            'and Eoin Morgan scoring freely in the latter stages of England’s '
            'innings after they reached the halfway point on 47 for three. '
            '“The way we were finding the wicket, we were saying 120 might be '
            'a good score to keep us in the game,” Buttler said. “Obviously '
            'that would have been well short with the way conditions changed. '
            'But I think sometimes when you set your sights a little bit '
            'lower, it allows you to stay calmer. The depth we have in the '
            'team allows you to play with freedom at the same time.” Morgan’s '
            '40 off 36 balls, accelerating after a slow start, was his highest '
            'score for 13 innings going back more than a year. “I’m incredibly '
            'proud of everything we’ve done tonight,” he said. “The guys had '
            'to fight unbelievably hard. Sri Lanka have pushed us further than '
            'we’ve been pushed so far in this tournament, and we’re just '

            'protocols by leaving his hotel last Friday to meet people outside '
            'the officials’ bubble. Gough had officiated in three World Cup '
            'matches, but was pulled from the game between India and New '
            'Zealand on Sunday and is confined to his hotel room. He is '
            'scheduled to return to the middle in the game between New Zealand '

{'article': 'Scott Morrison has used his national statement at the Cop26 to '
            'emphasise that Australia will probably overachieve on its 2030 '
            'emissions reduction target in an effort to blunt international '
            'criticism about his government’s lack of climate ambition. While '
            'the lead-up to the Glasgow summit was dominated by Morrison’s '
            'negotiations with the National party to land a net zero '
            'commitment by 2050, the UN-led event is focused on ambition for '
            'the 2030s. Australia – part of a bloc of big emitters and '
            'exporters at last weekend’s G20 summit in Rome attempting to '
            'water down commitments in the final communique to phase out coal '
            '– has been criticised for not increasing its ambition in the '
            'critical decade.\n'
            'Morrison used his set-piece address to the Glasgow conference to '
            'tell his peers that Australia had submitted a new nationally '
            'determined contribution, noting that Australia’s emissions would '
            '“fall by 35% by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment”. For '
            '2030, the new NDC says: “Australia reaffirms its ambitious '
            'economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse emissions to 26-28% '
            'below 2005 levels by 2030, and will exceed it by up to 9 '
            'percentage points”. “Australia’s emissions projections 2021 '
            'demonstrate that we are on track to reduce emissions by up to 35% '
            'below 2005 levels by 2030,” it says. The updated NDC also said '
            'Australia would adopt an economy-wide target of net zero '
            'emissions by 2050 “covering all sectors and gases included in '
            'Australia’s national inventory”. In the lead-up to Cop26, under '
            'pressure from key allies, including the summit host, Boris '
            'Johnson – Morrison attempted to increase Australia’s Abbott-era '
            '2030 target to something more in line with the updated '
            'projections, which say a 35% reduction is possible. But that '
            'effort was vetoed by the National party. The agreement to adopt '
            'net zero also went down to the wire. While a number of leaders '
            'used their opening contributions to the Glasgow summit to issue '
            'stark warnings about the existential risks associated with '
            'failing to mitigate the risks of runaway global heating, Morrison '
            'struck an upbeat note.\n'
            'In statements to the conference on Monday, the UN secretary '
            'general, António Guterres, said optimistic assessments of '
            'progress on tackling the climate crisis were “an illusion” while '
            'the British prime minister likened the current position of the '
            'world to a scenario in a James Bond film. Boris Johnson said a '
            'common plot device in the spy thrillers was 007 “strapped to a '
            'doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured '
            'wire to pull to turn it off while a red digital clock ticks down '
            'remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know '
            'it. “And we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global '
            'leaders, as James Bond today, except that the tragedy is that '
            'this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.” But '
            'Morrison declared there was “cause for optimism”. Australia’s '
            'prime minister told leaders 18 months ago the world was “staring '
            'into the abyss of a one in one hundred years pandemic”. “The '
            'vaccines we would need had not only not been invented, but there '
            'had never been a vaccine for a coronavirus,” the prime minister '
            'said. “But here we are. Billions vaccinated and the world is '
            'reclaiming what Covid has taken from us. “The challenge of '
            'combating climate change will be met in the same way, and it will '
            'be met by those who are largely not in this room. “It will be our '
            'scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, '
            'industrialists and financiers that will chart this path to net '
            'zero – and it is up to us as leaders to back them in.” Morrison’s '
            'predecessor as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said Australia’s '
            'technology-based approach and refusal to do more by 2030 had been '
            '“received badly” internationally. Speaking from Glasgow, Turnbull '
            'said the goal of the conference was to increase 2030 commitments '
            'and that Morrison had not done that was “a very big '
            'disappointment” . He said Morrison should not expect credit for '
            'claiming a projection that Australia would do more to cut '
            'emissions by 2030 but not formally committing to do it. '
            '“Projections do not provide any commitment or determination… a '
            'projection is just a guess,” Turnbull told the ABC’s RN '
            'Breakfast. “We’ve got to face up to the fact that we’ve got to '
            'stop burning coal and gas, we’ve got to stop burning fossil '
            'fuels. The proposition that seems to be fashionable in some '
            'quarters here that we can keep on burning coal, and in indeed '
            'exporting coal, and that somehow is consistent with getting to '
            'net zero by 2050, is nonsense. The reality is if we keep burning '
            'fossil fuels we will fry the planet.” Hopes that the Glasgow '
            'summit will yield more ambitious pledges have been dampened by '
            'the failure of G20 countries to reach a consensus on key '
            'commitments in Rome last weekend. The Rome summit – staged as a '
            'precursor event for Glasgow – wound up with a communique that did '
            'not include a firm commitment to achieve net zero carbon '
            'emissions by 2050, and had only a vague commitment to “phasing '
            'out investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity … '
            'as soon as possible”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, is not '
            'attending the Glasgow conference. In a written statement to the '
            'Cop, China – the world’s biggest emitter – called on developed '
            'countries to “provide support to help developing countries do '
            'better”.\n'
            'According to a text of his statement published by the Xinhua news '
            'agency, the Chinese president stressed the responsibility of '
            'developed countries in tackling climate change, saying that they '
            'should not only do more themselves, but should also provide '
            'support to help developing countries do better. China has not '
            'made any new significant commitments. India has now pledged to '
            'meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070. India’s prime '
            'minister, Narendra Modi, unveiled five pledges on Monday. The '
            'country will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to '
            '500GW by 2030 and get half of its energy from renewable resources '
            'by the same date. Modi said India would reduce its projected '
            'carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030, and reduce '
            'the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%. The US president, Joe '
            'Biden, told the conference the world only had a limited window to '
            'deal with the climate crisis. He said his country was“back at the '
            'table” of international climate action, and intended to lead by '
            'example. Biden’s decision to return the US to the Paris agreement '
            'spurred a round of ambitious climate pledges from other world '
            'leaders earlier in 2021. But he is struggling to secure '
            'legislative approval for his policy agenda at home.',

{'article': 'British households will remain worse off than before the pandemic '
            'until 2023 as rising inflation hits living standards, the '
            'Treasury’s economics watchdog has warned as Rishi Sunak sought to '
            'defend his budget. Charlie Bean, a former Bank of England deputy '
            'governor and board member of the Office for Budget '
            'Responsibility, said that growth in household incomes, after '
            'taking account of inflation, would effectively stall over the '
            'next two years.\n'
            'Answering questions from MPs on the Treasury committee on '
            'Tuesday, he said: “We don’t have real household disposable income '
            'getting above pre-pandemic levels until the back end of 2023, and '
            'it’s growing at a pretty mediocre rate from then on.” The OBR '
            'issued forecasts alongside last week’s budget showing that '
            'inflation would weigh down household incomes over the next two '
            'years, before rising by just 1.3% a year on average by the middle '
            'of the decade. Sunak later told the MPs on the committee that he '
            'was taking action to protect low-paid workers amid the living '
            'standards squeeze. However, he admitted it would take time to '
            'have an impact on real-terms wages. “Is it going to happen '
            'overnight? Of course these things don’t happen overnight. But '
            'we’re putting in place all the things that are required for there '
            'to be better wage increases for people over time,” he said. The '
            'chancellor said raising the national living wage, cutting the '
            'universal credit taper rate, and investing in training and '
            'education schemes and other public services would help those on '
            'low incomes. He also said his “goal, my mission” was to bring '
            'down tax from the highest levels since the 1950s. “For those on '
            'the lowest incomes for whom these things make the most '
            'difference, actually next year – because of the increase in the '
            'national living wage, [and] if they’re on universal credit, '
            'they’ll benefit from the taper rate – they’ll have significantly '
            'more cash in their pockets.” Last week the Institute for Fiscal '
            'Studies warned that Britain was set for the worst wage squeeze in '
            'modern history, with the average worker on course to be £13,000 a '
            'year worse off by the middle 2020s than they would have been if '
            'wages had risen at pre-2008 financial crisis rates. Despite the '
            'unprecedented squeeze, Sunak insisted that breaking two '
            'Conservative manifesto pledges – raising national insurance and '
            'pausing the pensions triple lock – was justified. “I genuinely '
            'believe it was the right and fair thing to do,” he told MPs, '
            'saying that high levels of government borrowing and debt incurred '
            'during the pandemic needed tackling to provide “fiscal space” to '
            'protect against future shocks. Pointing out that pensions were at '
            'the highest level relative to earnings from work in the past 30 '
            'years, he said applying the triple lock would have meant finding '
            '“billions of pounds” in savings elsewhere. “I didn’t think that '
            'was fair,” he said.\n'
            'The state pension will rise by 3.1% from next April, rather than '
            'by more than 8% if they had risen in-line with average earnings '
            'before that element of the triple lock was suspended. Sunak also '

{'article': 'My father-in-law, Peter Watson-Wood, who has died aged 92, was '
            'known for many things – notably as a photographer, film-maker, '
            'producer and all-round entrepreneur. Born to Molly (nee Payton) '
            'and Dougie Watson-Wood, a journalist, in Sutton, Surrey, at the '
            'age of eight Peter contracted meningitis. Not expected to live '
            'through the night, he was kept awake and alive by Molly reading '
            'to him – instilling an undying love of stories. He escaped death '
            'again in the kitchen Morrison shelter when a small bomb '
            'penetrated the roof during the Battle of Britain and landed on '
            'his bed. It threatened to blow up the house but not before Dougie '
            'heaved it out of the upstairs window. In 1946, after leaving '
            'Sutton high school for boys, Peter was drafted into the RAF and '
            'was chosen for the bomb disposal force – digging his way across '
            'Britain in search of live bombs. His working life began as a '
            'counter clerk at the labour exchange in Ealing, however he soon '
            'got a job at an advertising agency, John Mitchell & Partners, as '
            'an account manager. In 1952 Peter had front-row seats to King '
            'George VI’s funeral as the procession passed the agency window. '
            'Through a friendship with the actor and entertainer Tony Newley, '
            'Peter’s circle included stars of the silver screen, such as Peter '
            'Sellers and Diana Dors. Visiting Penzance in 1956, Peter met the '
            '‘“smudger” (tourist photographer) Mike Courtney, and joined him '
            'in business. They erected the now famous Land’s End signpost - '
            'charging tourists to have their pictures taken – and expanded to '
            'John O’Groats and Aberdeen Beach. Peter moved to Cornwall '
            'permanently in 1959, and by the late 1960s was working as a local '
            'news cameraman. When the Torrey Canyon disaster struck in 1967, '
            'he managed to secure exclusive footage of the prime minister, '
            'Harold Wilson, viewing the stricken tanker; ITN picked up his '
            'story for the 6 O’Clock News and henceforth commissioned him to '
            'make television documentaries. For three decades he filmed far '
            'and wide. From meditating with the Beatles in India in 1967, he '
            'travelled to New Guinea for a series called The World About Us '
            '(1973) and defied the land speed record at Black Rock Desert for '
            'a BBC film on the Thrust 2, For Britain and the Hell of It '
            '(1987). Through his work he also befriended many of the St Ives '
            'painters, such as Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton and Barbara '
            'Hepworth. In the 90s, Peter turned to producing feature films, '
            'among them Mad Dogs and Englishmen (1995), starring Elizabeth '
            'Hurley, Tales of the Riverbank (2008), featuring the voices of '
            'Jim Broadbent and Steve Coogan, and, finally, The Wicker Tree '
            '(2011), a sequel to the 1973 cult Scottish horror film The Wicker '
            'Man. Refusing retirement, Peter created paintings and wrote '
            'poetry and two autobiographies. A marriage to Wilma Smith in 1958 '
            'ended in divorce. Peter is survived by his second wife, Annie '
            '(nee Howard), whom he married in 1987, his sons, Gary, from his '
            'first marriage, and Christopher, from his second, two '

{'article': 'England players have struck a new pay deal with the Rugby '
            'Football Union that will see Eddie Jones’s squad earn around '
            '£70,000 each if they win all three of their autumn '
            'internationals. Victory over Tonga this weekend will give the '
            'players at least £23,000 in match fees while, in contrast, the '
            'Pacific Islanders earn just £500 a week. Last September the '
            'England players agreed a 25% pay cut for one season due to the '
            'financial impact of the pandemic on the union but a new more '
            'performance-related agreement has been reached. The minimum the '
            'players will make is less than the pre-pandemic match fee of '
            'around £23,000 but victory in matches against Tonga, Australia '
            'and South Africa would activate a bonus clause, meaning the squad '
            'collecting a similar amount. In addition, the players may earn '
            'even more if the RFU’s commercial performance exceeds forecasts.\n'
            'England players are the best paid in the world – even factoring '
            'in last season’s cut – which is further highlighted by '
            'comparisons with this weekend’s opponents. The RFU is, however, '
            'making a six-figure donation to the Tonga union as a goodwill '
            'gesture, as was the case when Samoa came to Twickenham in 2017. '
            '“Player fees for future games have been re-negotiated to include '
            'an increased bonus component based on performance,” read an RFU '
            'statement. “Underpinning this is a revenue share agreement with '
            'the RFU. If the players perform well on the pitch, they will earn '
            'the same as the previous deal and if the RFU commercial '
            'performance exceeds projected forecasts then the players will '
            'share in this upside. The RFU greatly appreciates the strong '
            'cooperation and support from players, the RPA and the players’ '
            'agents throughout the pandemic.” The RFU has also announced '
            'closer longer-term links with the Tongan union, which include '
            'measures such as providing support staff for the Pacific '
            'Islanders this autumn and an ambition for England pathway coaches '
            'to spend time working in Tonga. On the eve of England’s World Cup '
            'pool stage victory over Tonga in 2019, the then attack coach '
            'Scott Wisemantel urged the RFU to consider touring the Pacific '
            'Islands. The Tonga chief executive, Peter Harding, appeared to '
            'accept that was unlikely to happen, however, when welcoming the '
            'closer alliance with the RFU. He said: “We understand and accept '
            'World Rugby rules, commercial realities make it a challenge to '
            'host England. However, innovative partnerships like the one we '
            'have developed with the RFU will assist to stabilise the [Tonga '
            'union] and assist us to make the game more inclusive to women and '
            'children; to deliver a strong talent pathway while working '
            'towards representation at World Rugby.”',

            'French president, Emmanuel Macron, that Morrison lied to him over '
            'an abandoned $90bn submarine contract. Morrison said he was as '

            'disclose information about the Aukus deal as it was too '
            'confidential. After Macron’s impromptu attack on Morrison, text '

{'article': 'My friend Brian Colston, who has died aged 99, was one of a '
            'generation of pioneering GPs who helped to transform primary '
            'health care in Britain. Over more than 40 years he developed a '
            'range of innovative services of national significance in '
            'Birmingham’s inner city. Working out of small, cramped premises '
            'on the Lee Bank estate, Brian led the development of preventive '
            'health care in the city. His innovative work included dedicated '
            'asthma and diabetes clinics; contraceptive advice and family '
            'planning services; attached social worker schemes; and a day '
            'hostel for the city centre homeless and people with addictions. '
            'The practice also established one of the first patient '
            'association groups in the country. Born in Bristol to Margaret '
            '(nee Moore), a teacher, and Edward Colston, an undertaker, Brian '
            'attended Bristol grammar school. He spent the second world war in '
            'the Royal Signals serving in east Asia. Then the Forces Education '
            'Scheme enabled him to study medicine at the University of '
            'Bristol. There he met Enid Furnival, whom he married in 1951. '
            'After he qualified as a doctor in 1956 they moved to Birmingham, '
            'where Brian spent the whole of his professional life. After many '
            'years in the practice, Brian secured funding for a new '
            'purpose-built health centre on Lee Bank, which opened in 1985, '
            'embracing the comprehensive range of services that he saw as the '
            'core of his vision of good primary health care. He was also '
            'actively involved with Birmingham health authority and the '
            'Medical Practitioners’ Union and played a key role in setting up '
            'a GP-led maternity ward to assist safer maternity care. He was '
            'also involved in the establishment of the Birmingham pregnancy '
            'advisory service, which, in 1968, became the British Pregnancy '
            'Advisory Service, at a time when – despite the passing of the '
            '1967 Abortion Act – safe, legal abortions were still difficult '
            'for many women to access. As a mark of his many achievements, in '
            '1989 he was appointed OBE. After retiring in 1991 he moved to '
            'Devon to enjoy his passion for sailing, as well as gardening and '
            'photography, before returning to Birmingham with Enid to spend '
            'his last years. He was a thoughtful, kind and generous man who '
            'dedicated his life to the health and wellbeing of the people of '
            'inner-city Birmingham. Brian is survived by Enid, their three '
            'children, Lucy, Simon and Nicola, and six grandchildren. His '
            'eldest son, Tim, died in 2014.',

{'article': 'Rail accident inspectors have said it is too early to release '
            'indications of what caused the collision between two trains at '
            'Salisbury on Sunday evening. But by now CCTV and data logs from '
            'signals and trains are likely to have given them a strong idea of '
            'what led the Great Western and South Western Railway services to '
            'crash into each other. That might prove to be a fault with the '
            'signal; or that a train passed a red light; that the brakes '
            'failed; or even that the brakes worked but the wheels slid, in '
            'the season when leaves on the line can make the rails '
            'treacherous. Whatever the cause turns out to be, the next phase '
            'of investigation will work out the deeper underlying reasons – '
            'and then address those factors, whether they be human, technical '
            'or systemic. This, the UK rail industry believes, is what it does '
            'extremely well – to the point where it could justly proclaim '
            'itself the safest railway in Europe during the last decade. '
            'Nonetheless, the blemishes on the record have been appearing with '
            'concerning regularity in recent years. Until 2020, the 2007 '
            'derailment in Grayrigg was the last time a passenger died in a UK '
            'train crash – a huge turnaround after a succession of terrible '
            'accidents in the days of Railtrack around the millennium. Last '
            'year, though, came the tragedy at Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, '
            'when a landslip caused a Scotrail service to come off the tracks, '
            'causing three people onboard to lose their lives. But this '
            'weekend’s accident in Salisbury marked the first significant '
            'collision between two moving trains in passenger service since '
            'the terrible events of Ladbroke Grove, London in 1999. Throw in a '
            'succession of derailments, and trains hitting the buffers in '
            'London and Liverpool in recent months, and it might feel '
            'pertinent to ask if this is more than just a run of bad luck. In '
            'the context of what went before, Network Rail, safety remains '
            'extraordinarily good – certainly compared with other forms of '
            'transport. Modelling from the Rail Safety and Standards Board '
            '(RSSB) showed that a passenger would take on more than 20 times '
            'the risk of fatality travelling the same distance in a car than '
            'on a train. And while incidents have mounted – until the 2020 '
            'lockdown, there was an alarming resurgence in the number of '
            'Spads, or signals passed at danger, the acronym that became '
            'familiar after the Ladbroke Grove inquests – the industry argues '
            'that ever fewer have fatal consequences. That hasn’t proved '
            'entirely true: deaths of rail workers rose from zero in 2016 to '
            'five in 2021. And accident inspectors criticised Network Rail for '
            'long-term safety failings that led to the deaths of two track '
            'workers in south Wales in 2019. But a safety taskforce since then '
            'has led to a shift in policy that will completely eliminate '
            '“lookout working”, when people conduct repairs on a track where '
            'trains are still running. Meanwhile, extreme weather has made '
            'upkeep of the track an ever more difficult task – as disruption '
            'on both main lines from London to Scotland this weekend '
            'underlined. The railway has increased its spending on resilience, '
            'a task whose critical importance was underlined by Stonehaven, '
            'but climate change is likely to elevate the budget. Reports of '
            'objects on the line are also monitored by the RSSB – and '
            'incidents of trees and wires falling on the tracks in high winds '
            'and storms have become more frequent. Managing all these is where '
            'the rail industry believes the trends remain generally positive. '
            'According to the RSSB, collisions between trains have been '
            'recorded at two to three a year over the last five years. '
            'Although one driver has been seriously injured, to escape '
            'fatalities in the worst such collision this century is a record '
            'few would have expected 20 years ago. • This article was amended '
            'on 2 November 2021 to make clear that the Salisbury accident was '
            'the first significant collision between moving trains in '

            'anchor announced he would be covering the climate summit from '

{'article': 'The Morrison government has unveiled an additional $500m for '
            'international climate finance on the first day of the Cop26 '
            'summit in Glasgow. But Australia’s prime minister says the '
            'funding will be directed to projects in the Indo-Pacific rather '
            'than distributed through the green climate fund.\n'
            'After visiting a Glasgow shipyard early on Monday to return fire '
            'in an escalating diplomatic row with the French president, '
            'Emmanuel Macron, Scott Morrison joined the Cop26 and met Pacific '
            'leaders on the opening day of the summit. The prime minister of '
            'Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, characterised Australia’s new commitment '
            'to net zero emissions by 2050 as “a start”. But he said he wanted '
            'a concrete plan for Australia “to halve emissions by 2030”. The '
            'Fijian prime minister presented Morrison with a copy of his '
            'country’s Climate Change Act “as a guide”.\n'
            'Before the Cop26 climate summit, Pacific leaders warned Morrison '
            'they face existential peril because of global heating, which '
            'contributes to rising sea levels, exposing island nations to the '
            'risk of inundation. In the lead-up to Glasgow, Pacific countries '
            'lobbied Morrison to boost Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction '
            'target. Morrison acknowledged on Monday there was “no greater '
            'threat to our Pacific family than climate change”. But he said '
            'Australia would pursue international financing to combat the '
            'climate crisis on its own terms. “We are not putting this '
            '[funding] through other worldwide institutions, other groups like '
            'this,” Morrison told reporters in Glasgow. “We are doing this '
            'direct. We want to make sure that the climate finance investments '
            'that Australians are making are invested in our back yard, among '
            'our Pacific Island family and among our south-east Asian partners '
            'and friends. “We want to cut out all the red tape and get rid of '
            'all the bureaucracy and make sure that this funding is going to '
            'work directly within the region, making a big difference for '
            'their resilience and their mitigation to ensure they can deal, '
            'not just with trying to reduce their own emissions, but more '
            'significantly, being able to deal with the consequences of '
            'climate change which they are already experiencing in their many '
            'Pacific Island nations.” The green climate fund was set up '
            'through the UN’s climate convention to help developing countries '
            'adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own '
            'greenhouse gas emissions. But Morrison pulled Australia out of '
            'the fund in 2018 during an interview with the radio broadcaster '
            'Alan Jones. Subsequently, Australia has funded projects in the '
            'Pacific region, and the prime minister pledged a further $500m on '
            'Monday. Morrison said the money would be directed to Pacific and '
            'south-east Asian countries to enhance climate resilience for '
            'future infrastructure investments, including roads, schools and '
            'bridges. On the sidelines of the conference, Australia also '
            'signed an agreement with Fiji to develop a carbon market.\n'
            'Fiji has become the first country to join the Morrison '
            'government’s proposed Indo-Pacific carbon offsets scheme. Under '
            'the Morrison government’s roadmap to achieve net zero emissions, '
            'nearly half the abatement to be undertaken between now and 2050 '
            'will be delivered by “global technology trends”, “further '
            'technology breakthroughs” and through international and domestic '
            'offsets. Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, '
            'Angus Taylor, said Australia’s commitment to achieve net zero '
            'involved purchasing abatement through offsets. “We are putting in '
            'place the building blocks to enable that to occur,” Taylor said. '
            'He said the Indo-Pacific offset scheme would “help Australia’s '
            'private sector meet its emissions reduction targets by enabling '
            'investment in credible projects in the region that demonstrate '
            'high environmental integrity”.',

{'article': 'The treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said US multinationals '
            'who have spent years avoiding paying tax on American soil will be '
            'forced to help fund improvements to education, social and '
            'infrastructure programmes, thanks to the landmark global tax '
            'deal.\n'
            'Speaking in Ireland, where 800 US companies are based, Yellen '
            'said the new global tax rate agreed by 136 OECD countries halted '
            'the “race to the bottom” where multinationals scoured the world '
            'for the lowest corporation tax rate, failing to pay their dues to '
            'the populations that helped them make billions every year in '
            'profits. Joe Biden’s $1.75tn Build Back Better plan “is spread '
            'over a decade and paid for through raising revenues, not taxing '
            'working families … but in part thanks to this [OECD] tax deal by '
            'asking companies to pay more, by corporations that are very '
            'profitable and can afford to contribute revenues”. She said the '
            'US “needed to invest in people”, particularly in education, '
            'infrastructure and broadband, telling an event in Dublin that '
            'America’s roads and bridges are falling down, and that the lack '
            'of broadband access had also hit many families hard during the '
            'pandemic. Some were forced to “drive to a parking lot outside '
            'McDonald’s for their kids to be able to do their homework and '
            'have access to the internet,” she said. She said: “I am proud of '
            'the new international tax deal, because it not only provides '
            'benefits for everyday families, it will also stabilize the '
            'century-old international tax system.” Yellen used the Institute '
            'of International and European Affairs in Dublin to heap praise on '
            'Ireland – an implicit thanks for eventually buckling under '
            'pressure from the US to raise its 12.5% corporation tax rate and '
            'join the 15% OECD rate. She added: “Importantly, the deal ends '
            'the chaotic array of digital services taxes that have '
            'discriminated against Irish and US companies.” Ireland’s economy '
            'relies heavily on US companies. Sources recently claimed in '
            'interviews with the Guardian that Microsoft, Apple and Pfizer are '
            'responsible for 30% of the country’s entire corporation tax take '
            '– the equivalent of about €4bn. Although those three companies '
            'are heavily invested in the country, and in Pfizer’s case a '
            'substantial manufacturing base, they now face paying additional '
            'taxes at home as part of the new global tax regime. Tax avoidance '
            'schemes such as the so-called double Irish Dutch sandwich that '
            'allowed companies like Google to funnel their huge revenues from '
            'Europe through Ireland and on to offshore zero-tax havens in the '
            'Caribbean, are now outlawed. Yellen on Monday said Ireland will '
            'remain one of the best places in the world for multinational '
            'companies to invest in, even after Dublin gave up its prized '
            '12.5% rate. She said while some viewed Ireland as a tax haven, '
            '“perception often lags behind reality” and that Ireland was '
            '“already winning this new race to the top, with its robust '
            'business environment”. Yellen said: “Here is my honest assessment '
            'of what it will not do: it won’t change this country’s status as '
            'one of the best places to do business in the world.”',

{'article': 'Alarm, anger and a few significant promises featured during '

            'talks came to life in a cold and wet Glasgow on Monday. The tone '
            'was set by Boris Johnson, who opened the Cop26 talks with a stark '
            'warning that “the anger and impatience of the world will be '
            'uncontainable” if the talks fail to get the world on track to '
            'avoid disastrous global heating of more than 1.5C.\n'
            'António Guterres, the UN secretary general, noted governments’ '
            'lack of progress in cutting planet-heating emissions. There were '
            'some significant announcements, too, such as Narendra Modi, prime '
            'minister of India, promising that his country would get to net '
            'zero emissions by 2070 and Johnson unveiling new climate aid for '
            'vulnerable developing countries. But overall, the tenor was of '
            'impatience and occasional frustration.\n'
            'Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados I ask to you: what must '
            'we say to our people, living on the frontline in the Caribbean, '
            'in Africa, in Latin America, in the Pacific, when both ambition '
            'and, regrettably, some of the needed faces at Glasgow, are not '
            'present? What excuse should we give for the failure? “When will '
            'leaders lead? Our people are watching, and our people are taking '
            'note. And are we really going to leave Scotland without the '
            'resolve and the ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and '
            'to save out planet? “Are we so blinded and hardened that we can '
            'no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?” Wavel Ramkalawan, '
            'president of Seychelles Fellow leaders, from Seychelles, our '
            'message is simple: we have to act immediately. Let the change be '
            'a real one, let the paradigm shift happen. May those who exploit '
            'without thinking of tomorrow stop. May we realise that in this '

            'minister The worse it gets, the higher the price when we are '
            'eventually forced by catastrophe to act, because humanity has '
            'long since run down the clock on climate change. It’s one minute '
            'to midnight on that Doomsday Clock and we need to act now.” Joe '
            'Biden, US president There’s no more time to hang back or sit on '
            'the fence or argue amongst ourselves. This is a challenge of our '
            'collective lifetimes. The existential threat, threat to human '
            'existence as we know it, and every day we delay, the cost of '
            'inaction increases. So let this be the moment that we answer '
            'history’s call here in Glasgow.” Narendra Modi, Indian prime '
            'minister By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero '
            'emissions … Today, the entire world acknowledges that India is '

            'or it stops us. It’s time to say, ‘Enough … Enough of treating '

            'I call on all of us to do whatever it takes, now, to limit global '
            'warming to 1.5C. And we can do it. Because climate change is '
            'man-made, science tells us. So we can do something about it. It’s '
            'our opportunity to write history. Even more, it’s our duty to act '

{'article': 'A man who sexually assaulted two women after killing them '
            'performed similar sex acts on bodies at two hospital mortuaries, '
            'a court has heard. David Fuller, 67, is on trial for the murder '
            'of Wendy Knell, 25, and Caroline Pierce, 20, in two separate '
            'attacks in Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 1987. He initially denied '
            'killing the women but changed his plea to manslaughter by reason '
            'of diminished responsibility after learning of DNA evidence, '
            'Maidstone crown court heard on Monday. Knell was found dead in '
            'her apartment in Guildford Road on 23 June 1987. Her body showed '
            'signs of blunt force trauma to the head, asphyxiation to the '
            'neck, and sexual assault after her death, the court was told. '
            'Pierce was killed five months later outside her home in Grosvenor '
            'Park on 24 November of the same year. Neighbours described '
            'hearing screams from her flat on the night in question, the court '
            'heard. She was then reported missing and there was no sign of her '
            'in her flat. Her naked body was discovered three weeks later in a '
            'water-filled dyke at St Mary in the Marsh in Kent on 15 December '
            '1987. There were reports of “prowler activity” in the lead-up to '
            'both their deaths, with local women reporting a voyeur looking '
            'through their windows, said the prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC. '
            'Fuller, an electrician, was arrested on suspicion of murder on 3 '
            'December 2020 following new analysis of decades-old DNA evidence. '
            'Officers searched his home, finding images of dead women at the '
            'two hospital mortuaries being abused by Fuller, the court heard. '
            'Four hard drives attached to the back of a cupboard “were found '
            'to contain a library of unimaginable sexual depravity”, said '
            'Atkinson. “There were both photographs and videos which showed '
            'the defendant sexually abusing female corpses in the mortuaries '
            'of the two hospitals at which he worked, first the Kent and '
            'Sussex hospital, where he worked full-time from 1989, and then '
            'the Tunbridge Wells hospital, to which he moved in 2010.” In a '
            'police interview, Fuller admitted to using Facebook to search for '
            'photos of the people he abused in the mortuary, the court heard. '
            '“He admitted to searching for them on the internet, including on '
            'Facebook,” said Atkinson. “He claimed that this would be after '
            'the offending, rather than research before offending.” Fuller '
            'would later go back and name the files containing images of his '
            'offending against dead people using the ledgers from the mortuary '
            'and identification tags on the bodies, the court heard. The '
            'prosecutor said these images provided evidence that Fuller '
            'committed the acts out of “sexual gratification” and not mental '
            'illness. “It shows the defendant derived sexual gratification '
            'from sexual activity with those who have died,” said Atkinson. He '
            'added: “It therefore provides a reason for the killings, however '
            'deviant and repellent, that does not depend on an explanation of '
            'mental illness that deprived the defendant of his self-control.” '
            'Atkinson added that there was no evidence of the defendant '
            'suffering from mental health problems until 2010, when Fuller '
            'complained of feeling depressed over pain in his legs. The trial '
            'continues.',

{'article': 'Bank chief executives can survive an official censure, as Jes '
            'Staley proved in 2018 – when he kept his job despite being fined '
            '£642,000 for trying to unmask a whistleblower at Barclays. A '
            'second adverse finding tends to be terminal, however. This time '
            'Staley required complete vindication from regulators examining '
            'his, and the board’s, description of his relationship with '
            'Jeffery Epstein. His resignation signals that he did not get what '
            'he needed: he had to go. What, precisely, do regulators judge '
            'that he got wrong this time? Impossible to say until the '
            'Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority '
            'publish their report, which could be at least a month away; the '
            'only point of clarity currently is that there are “no findings '
            'that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein’s alleged '
            'crimes”, says Barclays. Fine, but the aim of the inquiry was to '
            'determine whether “a close professional relationship”, which was '
            'the gist of Staley’s account of his dealings with the sex '
            'offender financier, was strictly accurate. Regulators are '
            'seemingly unhappy with his characterisation. Staley will contest '
            'the findings, as he’s entitled to do. Viewed from outside, '
            'however, the most extraordinary aspect of the tale is not the '
            'narrow regulatory focus on who said what, and whether the '
            'presentation was crystal clear. One keeps coming back to the '
            'question of why Staley maintained any form of relationship with '
            'Epstein after the financier had been sentenced for soliciting '
            'prostitution from a minor in 2008. There was a Florida visit the '
            'following year and then, most remarkably, Staley and his wife '
            'popped in by yacht to see Epstein on his Caribbean island in '
            'April 2015. Staley was not alone in maintaining links with the '
            'convicted paedophile, of course, but even veteran Wall Street '
            'bankers touting for deals should be careful about the company '
            'they keep. Staley’s judgment was terrible. Regulatory run-ins '
            'aside, his performance as chief executive of Barclays has been '
            'better than the pedestrian share price would suggest. The biggest '
            'call was doubling up on investment banking, which was a risky bet '
            'on arrival in December 2015 but Barclays’ financial returns have '
            'gone back to respectable levels. Staley’s vision of a '
            '“transatlantic” bank that combines UK mortgages and Wall Street '
            'trading has prevailed. Edward Bramson, the activist who agitated '
            'for a retreat from investment banking, was defeated by numbers. '
            'In its clinical way, the stock market marked the end of the '
            'Staley era with a fall of only 1% in Barclays share price. The '
            'boss was seen as likely to leave soon anyway, and the new chief '
            'executive is CS Venkatakrishnan, a Staley recruit from JP Morgan '
            'who will not upset the broad strategy. But even publication of '
            'the regulators’ report, assuming Staley does not manage to '
            'overturn the findings of a 20-month inquiry, will not quite be '
            'the end of the story. There are also questions here for Nigel '
            'Higgins, the Barclays chair, and the rest of the board. The '
            'directors backed Staley all the way, and there was an air of '
            'defiance on Monday as they said they were “disappointed at this '
            'outcome” and heaped praise on their man. Is that a wise stance? '
            'Staley could easily have been fired after the whistleblower '
            'affair. It’s hard to see any upside for the bank in extending a '
            'quarrel with its two main regulators. UK-EU failings have led to '
            'Ryanair delisting Michael O’Leary loves a throwaway line, but his '
            'plan to delist Ryanair from the London Stock Exchange sounds '
            'advanced. He blames Brexit, by which he means EU rules that '
            'require EU airlines to be majority owned by nationals from within '
            'the bloc plus a few other European countries that do not include '
            'the UK. One can call it another blow to the standing of the '
            'London market, but it is primarily a political failure on the '
            'part of the UK and EU to agree a deal on airline ownership. If '
            'it’s OK for Swiss investors to own a slice of Irish-based '
            'Ryanair, there is no logic in denying UK investors. This is a '
            'Brexit loose-end that should have been settled in about five '
            'minutes of negotiation.',

            'All of which was met with silence by the world leaders assembled '
            'in the marquee. And the quieter it got, the more desperate '
            'Johnson became. You could see the flashes of panic in his eyes. '
            'Which isn’t to say there wasn’t some good material in between the '
            'attempted laughs. There was an acknowledgment that the world was '
            'now in the last chance saloon and that children wouldn’t forgive '
            'the attenders in Glasgow if they blew it. That more ‘blah, blah, '

            'to the carbon-neutral promised land. Boris had yet again '
            'misjudged his audience. They had come for gravitas and he was '
            'just too lightweight, too flippant, too obviously amoral for not '
            'just the most serious but also the only game in town. If you’re '
            'after a good time vibe with nothing much at stake, then Boris is '
            'your man. When the stakes are this high, then not so much. Prince '
            'Charles even appeared to be checking his phone during Boris’s '
            'speech. Because at heart Bertie Booster is just another '
            'self-interested chancer. He can’t even talk the talk, let alone '
            'walk the walk. His budget last week – and it was his more than '
            'Brand Rishi’s – didn’t once mention the climate crisis. Indeed he '
            'even cut air passenger duty. Not to mention reopening coalmines. '
            'After several exhortations from climate activists from the '
            'Pacific and the Andes, there were brief but worthy speeches from '
            'the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and Prince Charles '
            'spelling out the realities of the situation. The Prince of Wales '
            'even went so far as to say the world should be on a warlike '
            'footing. Then it was left to the 95-year-old David Attenborough '
            'to inject some much-needed emotion and passion into the '
            'proceedings. Against a powerful backdrop of film, stats and '
            'music, Attenborough laid his heart on the line. When he says the '
            'world is in a doomsday scenario, then you believe him. He is a '
            'man who has devoted his life to saving the natural world. Not an '
            'apparatchik who has been to countless previous climate change '
            'conferences where he has learned to hedge his bets and make the '
            'vaguest of promises he is fairly certain he has no chance of '
            'keeping. There was an electricity in the hall when Attenborough '

            'sense of collective guilt. Certainly Attenborough seemed to '
            'galvanise the politicians that followed. Mia Amor Mottley, prime '
            'minister of Barbados, didn’t mince her words. The climate crisis '
            'wasn’t an academic subject for her: it was a reality. If nothing '
            'was done then her island would disappear. “We want to exist in '
            '100 years’ time,” she said. And she dared to suggest that Cop26 '
            'might already be a failure due to the no shows of presidents Xi '
            'Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, '
            'but spelled out the financial realities. The developed countries '
            'had stumped up £9tn in quantitative easing to cope with Covid. So '
            'coming up with £500bn a year for developing countries shouldn’t '
            'be an impossibility. Though right now the wealthiest countries '
            'hadn’t even kept their promise of £100bn a year. The opening '

            'disappointment that the recent G20 in Rome had ended with such a '
            'feeble agreement on climate change. But by now, most world '
            'leaders had had enough of being reminded of their failures and '
            'were starting to get fidgety. It was time for their lunch and '
            'some side meetings. It would be nice if Cop26 was a success, but '
            'no one was counting on it. And some didn’t even seem that '

{'article': 'Antonio Conte has agreed to take over as Tottenham’s manager on a '
            'contract to June 2023 and is ready to sign the deal subject to '
            'final details. He will replace Nuno Espírito Santo, who was '
            'sacked on Monday after four months and 17 matches in charge. '
            'Negotiations between Conte and Tottenham broke down in the summer '
            'but he did not take another job and the club’s managing director '
            'of football, Fabio Paratici, made the former Juventus, Chelsea '
            'and Internazionale manager his No 1 target.\n'
            'By Monday afternoon paperwork was being prepared by Spurs to '
            'confirm the appointment and Conte travelled to London with his '
            'representatives. Conte is generally averse to taking a job midway '
            'through a season but let it be known he would make an exception '
            'for Manchester United if Ole Gunnar Solskjær were sacked. Spurs '
            'convinced him to take the same view of their offer. Conte has '
            'asked for guarantees regarding the next transfer windows to '
            'rebuild a squad that has lost five times in the Premier League '
            'this season. Tottenham’s talks with Conte collapsed in June after '
            'the club thought they were close to a deal. At that point '
            'Paratici, who worked with the manager for three successful '
            'seasons at Juventus from 2011, had not been hired and his '
            'presence has been crucial. Initial contact was made on Saturday '
            'night and Conte has been assured he will get more say over '
            'transfers and the chance to mould the team. Conte, who won league '
            'titles with Juve, Chelsea and Internazionale, left Inter in May '
            'over their plan to sell players. His spell at Juventus is the '
            'only time he has managed a team for more than two years and his '
            'Spurs contract is due to run for less than that. Nuno has gone '
            'after a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United on Saturday, during '
            'and after which he was barracked by supporters. Spurs turned to '
            'Nuno having failed to land a number of preferred candidates '
            'including Conte, Paulo Fonseca and Gennaro Gattuso.\n'
            'The former Wolves manager began with three Premier League wins, '
            'the first against Manchester City, and was named August’s manager '
            'of the month. But comprehensive defeats by Chelsea, Arsenal and '
            'United, coupled with an uninspiring style of play, prompted his '
            'dismissal. Spurs have gone two hours and 16 minutes without a '
            'shot on target in the Premier League. The Spurs chairman, Daniel '
            'Levy, also a target for fans’ anger on Saturday, and Paratici '
            'held talks after the United game before concluding a change was '
            'imperative. Tottenham are eighth in the Premier League and third '
            'in their Europa Conference League group, although they have '
            'reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. Paratici said: “I '
            'know how much Nuno and his coaching staff wanted to succeed and I '
            'regret that we have had to take this decision. Nuno is a true '
            'gentleman and will always be welcome here. We should like to '
            'thank him and his coaching staff and wish them well for the '
            'future.”\n'
            'The team have scored nine goals in 10 Premier League games and '
            'Harry Kane, who had hoped to leave for City in the summer, has '
            'looked well below his best. Nuno succeeded José Mourinho after '
            'Ryan Mason had been placed in interim charge. Spurs confirmed '
            'Nuno’s coaches – Ian Cathro, Rui Barbosa and Antonio Dias – have '
            'also left.',

{'article': 'Farewell then, Nuno. It was, let’s face it, almost entirely '
            'doomed from the start, to the extent there is pretty much zero '
            'point in analysing the gains, the losses and the legacy of '
            'Nuno-era Spurs. What memories will Tottenham’s 35th permanent '
            'managerial appointment leave in north London? A way of standing. '
            'An expression of sympathetic bafflement. The sense, above all, of '
            'a head coach who seemed at all times to be encrusted with an '
            'ancient sadness, a courtly keeper of the grail in someone else’s '
            'castle, whose final words, dispatched by the hand of Daniel Levy, '
            'will be “He chose … poorly”.\n'
            'But what did Spurs expect from a manager who plateaued out at '
            'Wolverhampton, who lost 17 league games last season, whose '
            'football is about control and caution and who they didn’t really '
            'want in the first place? Instead, as the club turns its sights '
            'towards next things and the electrifying prospect of Antonio '
            'Conte, there are only two points worth taking from the Nuno '
            'Espírito Santo interlude. Both of these are familiar territory. '
            'Both will speak to whatever it is Conte can expect to achieve in '
            'this job. First, what is a Tottenham manager for? This is a club '
            'defined too often by the appearance of progress, by light, noise '
            'and drama that exist in their own space, unrelated to any obvious '
            'substance. Consider, for example, the past seven months. Spurs '
            'have fired José Mourinho less than a week before a cup final, '
            'tried and failed to kickstart a super league, successfully '
            'demotivated Harry Kane, hired a fancy director of football, '
            'appointed the last man on the long list, sacked the last man on '
            'the long list and enacted a dramatic pursuit of the most '
            'high-profile unemployed manager in world football.\n'
            'In that time Spurs have moved from seventh in the Premier League '
            'to eighth. What has this cost? What has been the price tag on '
            'that mild nudge down the league table? Presumably anything up to '
            '£50m in payoffs, wasted wages and the declining value of your '
            'chief playing asset. It is, if nothing else, a very dramatic way '
            'of not doing very much. But then this has been the role of the '
            'Spurs manager, which involves, in its simple form, a kind of El '
            'Tel impresario quality, injecting some kind of life, vibes, '
            'energy, into this carefully metered environment. Nuno was never '
            'likely to win much. But he was never going come close to this '
            'model, he is a naturally conservative coach with the look on the '
            'touchline of a kindly hill farmer concerned by the travails of '
            'his favourite sickly heifer at the hands of the local vet. This '
            'is the second point. Is Levy prepared to reach for anything '
            'beyond this? To play that game for real? Because Conte is '
            'something else entirely. Not just a serious pedigree upgrade but '
            'a more profound shift of culture. This is an appointment that may '
            'just amount to a calling of the Levy bluff, a flushing out of '
            'that ruthless, strictly-business executive culture. Here is a '
            'manager who also doesn’t want a long-term thing. But he will make '
            'you win if you’re really serious. Muck this one up, fail once '
            'again to take the leap forward, and it will be entirely on Levy. '
            'Conte knows how to do this thing.\n'
            'There have been some oddly negative noises off in the past few '
            'days, a suggestion English football may have reason to be wary of '
            'a manager this ruthlessly driven. It is to be taken with a pinch '
            'of salt. He may lack the brand-friendly PR chops of a Solskjær. '
            'But Conte is a restless, angry, precision-engineered tactician. '
            'This is a manager who began slowly in his first season at '
            'Chelsea, went home for an insomniac holiday during the autumn '
            'break, came back with a plan and ran way with the league title '
            'playing Victor Moses at wing-back and David Luiz in a back three. '
            'It wasn’t all about control. Chelsea scored 85 goals. Conte got '
            'another title season out of Eden Hazard. He has five league '
            'titles at three clubs. Everything is urgency, fixes, fast-forward '
            'planning. He may have the right stuff for Kane, who needs someone '
            'bigger than him, some hard coaching and a clarification of what '
            'kind of player he wants to be. You want success? The man who can '
            'provide it is already at the door, scowling in through the '
            'fanlight, rattling at the locks. But he demands seriousness in '
            'return, a total commitment, an absence of flannel.\n'
            'This is the subtext to every move at Tottenham. This is a club '
            'run by a chairman who walks a strange kind of tightrope, '
            'balancing the demands of the crowd, the opera of fandom, with '
            'both a professional and a proposal eye on profit and loss. Levy '
            'sees the financial absurdities of his profession, errs towards '
            'probity and caution, but also seems to have bodged the chance to '
            'invest in something more. How much does this club really want '
            'success? And what would it look like? Is it simply existing close '
            'to the elite, preserving its income, doing the executive dance? '
            'Or the cold hard lust for trophies, for the kind of moments '
            'supporters crave?\n'
            'The biggest mistake Spurs made was the failure to back Mauricio '
            'Pochettino when times were good. They posted record profits the '
            'year they reached the Champions League final. But that squad was '
            'allowed to age, Kane to run himself into the ground. The asset '
            'was sweated to death when it could have been nourished, made into '
            'a team to sustain that level. If Conte does arrive he will be the '
            'fifth occupant of that manager’s office in two and half years '
            'since the move to the multi-use mega‑ground. His presence is also '
            'a kind of endgame, a calling-out of what the wider ambition '
            'really is here. Conte doesn’t care what your excuses are. He has '
            'employers waiting elsewhere if you’re going to send him out to '
            'battle with a baguette in his hand. It will, at the very least, '
            'be fascinating to watch. Over to you, then, Mr Levy.',

            'who are often deeply split on the issue of trans rights. Because '
            'it was reported by a Nottingham-based journalist in one of the '
            'BBC’s regional newsrooms, it was ultimately the responsibility of '
            'the BBC England division. Although the distinction would not be '
            'apparent to the typical reader, this means it was subject to a '
            'different editorial commissioning process to material produced '
            'out of the BBC’s national news headquarters. It was also '
            'published soon after the release of a 10-part podcast made by BBC '
            'Northern Ireland’s Stephen Nolan which looked at whether the BBC '
            'had itself been “captured” by the LGBTQ+ rights organisation '
            'Stonewall. That series was alternately celebrated and decried by '
            'BBC staff, depending on their attitude towards trans rights.',

            'green engineering projects to fund entrepreneurs finding new ways '
            'to help transition to net zero. The deal will include the '
            'creation of about 1,000 jobs at two campuses – one in northern '
            'England and one in Qatar – where climate technology businesses '
            'will be created, launched and developed. It is hoped that a '
            'further 10,000 roles will be created at the businesses launched '
            'at the campuses and in the wider clean-tech economy. The goal is '
            'for five “unicorn” companies – private firms valued at more than '
            '$1bn (£732m) – to be created at the centres by 2030, rising to 20 '
            'by 2040, which would in time provide returns to investors. The '
            'design of the campuses and the exact UK location has yet to be '
            'decided, and there will need to be access to local skills and '
            'manufacturing supply chain. Derby-based Rolls-Royce has several '
            'sites and suppliers based in the north of England. The Qatar '
            'Foundation, the state’s non-profit organisation created in 1995 '
            'to focus on education and research, will provide the funding to '
            'develop the campuses and support their operations for two '
            'decades. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce will bring the knowhow in '
            'engineering and high-end manufacturing, and will use the centre '
            'to develop emerging climate technologies. Startup businesses will '
            'be provided with academic help and funding for research and '
            'development on campus, combined with early-stage venture capital '
            'investment, so they can test, prove and later scale-up their '
            'technologies. Rolls-Royce has an ongoing relationship with the '
            'state-owned Qatar Airways, which is one of the company’s biggest '
            'customers for its Trent jet engines. Warren East, the chief '
            'executive of Rolls-Royce, called the transition to net zero “a '
            'societal imperative and an excellent commercial opportunity”. He '
            'added that the company wanted to accelerate the energy transition '
            'in sectors that were the hardest to decarbonise. The firm, which '
            'is also pushing ahead with plans to create a fleet of mini '
            'nuclear reactors, has pledged to reach net zero emissions from '
            'its operations by 2030.\n'

            'accelerate progress in clean energy, including by allowing us to '
            'fully take advantage of nascent technologies that could have a '
            'significant impact on tackling climate change,” East said. The '
            'venture was announced on the sidelines of the Cop26 climate '

            'globally that are investing in research and development in clean '

            'Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor in a race '
            'headed down to the wire. But Youngkin was not planning to '
            'participate, as he attempted to balance appeals to the former '
            'president’s supporters with a semblance of independence.\n'
            'Trump hoped a phone-in “tele rally” would hoist Youngkin past his '
            'Democratic opponent, the former governor Terry McAuliffe. The '
            'contest is seen by many as a referendum on the Biden presidency '
            'and a bellwether for midterm elections next year. On the day '
            'before polling day, the realclearpolitics.com polling average had '
            'Youngkin ahead by less than two points. Fivethirtyeight.com put '
            'the Republican up by one. McAuliffe had scheduled rallies in '
            'Roanoke, Virginia Beach and Richmond and in northern Virginia. '
            'Youngkin was to rally in Roanoke, Richmond, Virginia Beach and '
            'Loudon county. In Richmond, Youngkin addressed “an energetic '
            'crowd of what his campaign said was around 800 people” at a small '
            'airport, the Associated Press reported. “This is a moment for '
            'Virginians to push back on this left, liberal progressive agenda '
            'and take our commonwealth back,” he said. McAuliffe, who has '
            'called himself a “pro-business pro-progressive”, is a close ally '
            'of Bill and Hillary Clinton and has campaigned with President Joe '
            'Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris, former president Barack '
            'Obama and other high-profile Democrats. Nonetheless he has '
            'struggled to generate enthusiasm in a state Biden won by 10 '
            'points. Youngkin, a businessman, has not appeared with Trump. On '
            'Saturday, he told reporters: “I’m not going to be engaged in the '
            'tele-town hall. The teams are talking, I’m sure.” Youngkin has '
            'however comfortably dealt in Trump-esque attack lines, most '
            'prominently and potentially fruitfully focusing on how race is '
            'taught in schools. In return McAuliffe has sought to tie Youngkin '
            'firmly to Trump, not a tough task in the debate over education. '
            'Youngkin has repeatedly raised the subject of critical race '
            'theory, an academic discipline turned into a bogeyman by '
            'Republicans nationwide. CRT examines the ways in which racism '
            'operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Virginia '
            'public schools. Regardless, Youngkin has treated it as a genuine '
            'threat, stoking anger on the right, and has promised to ban it. '
            'Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, McAuliffe said '
            'Youngkin had gone too far. Citing a meeting with a voter in '
            'Hampton, he said the former school board member told him “our '
            'school boards were fine. Soon as Glenn Youngkin got nominated, '
            'all of a sudden, these people started showing up, creating such a '
            'ruckus, calling such obscene things”. “This was an African '
            'American woman,” McAuliffe said. “I can’t repeat on air what '
            'they’ve said about her. This was last night, up here in northern '
            'Virginia … we just lost a school board member … She said, ‘I was '
            'getting death threats. But when they said they were going to rape '
            'my children, I can’t take it anymore.’ “That’s what Glenn '
            'Youngkin has done here in Virginia. He’s created hatred and '
            'division just like Donald Trump, and that’s why Donald Trump, his '
            'final campaign is going to be for Glenn Youngkin here in '
            'Virginia. “We don’t want Trump. We don’t want Youngkin. We don’t '
            'want the hatred and division.” In a statement on Monday, Trump '
            'freely demonstrated his willingness to exploit hatred and '
            'division.\n'
            'Taking barely veiled shots at the Lincoln Project – anti-Trump '
            'Republicans who have campaigned against him in Virginia, '
            'sometimes controversially, and who Trump referred to only as '
            '“perverts” – the former president said his enemies were “trying '
            'to create an impression that Glenn Youngkin and I are at odds and '
            'don’t like each other. “Importantly, this is not true. We get '

            'policies, especially when it comes to the important subject of '
            'education.” Trump reiterated the need for Republicans to vote. He '
            'also sought to thread the needle between his insistence on mass '
            'voter fraud against him and the need for high Republican turnout '
            '– a trick he failed to pull off in Georgia in January, when '
            'Democrats won two Senate runoffs. If enough of his supporters '

{'article': 'Plants that look and smell like parsnips but are highly poisonous '
            'and potentially deadly have been washed up on beaches in Cumbria '
            'after the recent stormy weather. Coastguards have warned people '
            'to avoid the plants called hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe '
            'crocata), which is also known as dead man’s fingers. The '
            'coastguard rescue team based in Millom said they had received '
            'reports of the plant being washed up on local beaches. “Even a '
            'small portion can prove fatal to humans by attacking the nervous '
            'system,” they said on their Facebook page. “It is also fatal to '
            'animals. The plant has a highly poisonous root that looks and '
            'smells like parsnip. “It is highly likely that this is happening '
            'due to the aftermath of recent stormy weather. We advise people, '
            'especially with children and animals, to stay vigilant, avoid '
            'this plant and take extra care when visiting the beach.” Hemlock '
            'water dropwort, with leaves and stems which look like parsley, is '
            'one of Britain’s most poisonous indigenous plants. Eating it can '
            'cause nausea, vomiting, fever, seizures and hallucination. Deaths '
            'have occurred but are far more common in animals than humans, '
            'said Geoff Dann, a foraging teacher and writer who is about to '
            'publish a new book on edible plants. “It is known to kill '
            'livestock. Usually what happens is that it gets disturbed by the '
            'edge of a river by earthworks, or something, and the roots are '
            'exposed and are eaten by livestock.\n'
            '“There are also cases of people digging it up and thinking it is '
            'a plant you can eat, like water parsnip or wild celery … but that '
            'is pretty rare.” It is highly poisonous “but you’d have to eat a '
            'lot of it to die”, he said. “They are great big fat tubers, but '
            'who walks along a beach and picks up a random wild plant washed '
            'up on a beach and eats it? It seems a weird thing to do.” Deaths '
            'are rare but the unpleasantness and dangers of the plant was '
            'highlighted by a report in the Emergency Medical Journal (EMJ) '
            'about eight young adults on holiday in Argyll. They collected '
            'what they thought were water parsnips from a stream and made a '
            'curry. Ten hours later one of the group had a seizure and was '
            'taken to hospital. Others also became unwell and nauseous and a '
            'further person had be admitted to hospital after eating '
            'leftovers. The EMJ report concluded: “It is possible that with '
            'increasing interest in ‘natural’ foods, accidental poisoning of '
            'this nature may become more frequent. These cases illustrate the '
            'potential dangers of this, but highlight the fact that even in '
            'small communities expertise is available and if accessed '
            'appropriately can be invaluable.” Researchers in Italy have also '
            'written that hemlock water dropwort was used in pre-Roman '
            'Sardinia for the ritual killing of older people considered a '
            'burden. The plant, it has been said, leaves corpses with what '
            'could be described as a sardonic grin. Dann said the plant was '
            'not Britain’s most toxic. That accolade, he believes, should go '
            'to monkshood, or wolf’s bane. “There was a case a few years ago '
            'of a guy clearing it and he had a cut on his hand. The sap went '
            'in to the cut and it was enough to kill him.”',

{'article': 'On average around 4,300 cases a week are heard in the family '
            'courts in England and Wales – adding up to a total of 224,902 '
            'last year. It is estimated that 62% of cases involve allegations '
            'of domestic abuse. Almost a quarter are disputes between '
            'separating or separated couples, usually over their children. For '
            'the past three years, the number of applications for children to '

            'care now stands at a record 80,000, up from 65,000 a decade ago. '
            'Yet despite such startling figures, and the strong public '
            'interest in understanding the societal issues that underlie them, '
            'remarkably little is known by most people about what goes on in '
            'family courts. What is known is more likely to be anecdotal, via '
            'word of mouth or personal experience, than by a formal public '
            'channel such as the press or other media. That’s because since '
            '1960 there has been a presumption of secrecy in all cases '
            'involving children. Journalists and legal bloggers have the right '
            'to attend court, but not to report on what goes on there. In '
            'recent years there have been several attempts to open up the '
            'courts to increased scrutiny, while continuing to respect '
            'confidentiality so that children are never publicly identified. '
            'But the transparency review published last week by the president '
            'of the high court’s family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, should '
            'ensure that real change at last takes place. Having convened a '
            'panel and taken evidence, Sir Andrew has come down emphatically '
            'on the side of journalists and open justice campaigners. His '
            'report says that the pace of change so far has been “glacial”, '
            'and calls for a “major shift in culture and process” so that '
            'openness becomes “the new norm”. Specifically, journalists will '
            'be allowed to report on what goes on in family courts as of '
            'right, subject to anonymisation, and family members will be '
            'allowed to speak to reporters. Judges will be instructed to '
            'publish 10% of their judgments in anonymised form. More details '
            'of cases will be included on court lists, and there will be an '
            'annual report. Sir Andrew also wants to build a relationship of '
            'trust between the judiciary and the media, starting with a pilot '
            'reporting scheme in two areas. Sensitive questions remain. These '
            'include which documents reporters will have access to, '
            'particularly when these include descriptions of abuse. There are '
            'also resource considerations, both on the courts’ and on the '
            'press’s side. With the court service already under enormous '
            'pressure due to legal aid and other cuts, and rising poverty and '
            'the withdrawal of support services leading to higher caseloads, '
            'it is not clear how the anonymising of thousands of judgments '
            'will be accomplished. It remains to be seen what use news '
            'organisations will make of the increased access, at a time when '
            'coverage of the criminal courts has been reduced. But these are '
            'caveats. The overarching purpose, as Sir Andrew sets out, is not '
            'merely to reveal what goes in the family courts but to learn from '
            'it. More data, and the accountability that follows from increased '
            'scrutiny, should be expected to lead to improved practice. Family '
            'judges hold immense power, and society as a whole would benefit '
            'from an increased understanding of what they do, why they do it, '
            'and how this alters the course of hundreds of thousands of lives '
            'every year.',

{'article': 'So that answers that one, then. In a tournament where everything '
            'had gone England’s way, this time it all went against them: asked '
            'to bat first after losing the toss, labouring to work out how to '
            'pace their innings, bowling as dew drenched the outfield on a '
            'heavy, humid night, watching Tymal Mills limp off midway through '
            'his second over to shred their death bowling plans as Sri Lanka '
            'accelerated towards their target. But they refused to throw in '
            'the towel – after all, they needed it to soak dew off the ball – '
            'and thanks to the genius of Jos Buttler an often unpleasant '
            'evening became one to savour. Sri Lanka were beaten by 26 runs '
            'and with a 100% record after four games a place in the '
            'semi-finals is all but secured.\n'
            'Buttler led the team off, his colleagues walking 10 paces behind '
            'and applauding him all the way. Forty-eight hours after his '
            '32-ball 71 powered England to victory over Australia in Dubai, '
            'their diamond demonstrated several other facets of his brilliance '
            'with a 67-ball century, transforming an innings that for a while, '
            'as so many have in this tournament, got lost in the doldrums. But '
            'with the wind in his sails there are few batters to match Buttler '
            'and he accelerated to his first international Twenty20 century – '
            'becoming the second English player, after Heather Knight, to hit '
            'hundreds in all three formats – by lifting the final ball of the '
            'innings over square-leg for six. Over the course of 20 overs he '
            'was England’s opener, their anchor and their finisher. How they '
            'needed him. The thing about auras of invincibility is that, '
            'handsome as they are when they settle upon you, they are not very '
            'hardwearing. Just a couple of scratches and off it comes. It had '
            'taken three wonderfully dominant victories for England to '
            'construct the one they sported coming into this fixture, but '
            'within 20 minutes it was looking distinctly ragged.\n'
            'What has set this England team apart as they have clambered from '
            'white-ball ignominy to supremacy over the past six years is an '
            'unwavering consistency of intent. They go hard and, no matter the '
            'circumstances, they keep going hard. No let-up, no respite. Here, '
            'though, for an extended period they went worryingly limp. On an '
            'unfamiliar ground, on a wicket that was skating-rink flat and '
            'sometimes similarly skiddy, they could not find their footing for '
            'a long time. It did not help their cause that Sri Lanka, who had '
            'played three times in Sharjah at this World Cup, have a gem of '
            'their own in Wanindu Hasaranga, who claimed the wickets of Jason '
            'Roy, Jonny Bairstow and Eoin Morgan in four excellent overs. He '
            'has taken 34 wickets in 2021, the most by any bowler in any '
            'single year in this format. But once Buttler started his '
            'acceleration Sri Lanka had no answer. His first 50 took 45 balls '
            'and his second 22, as he made the short boundaries look '
            'positively microscopic. Morgan took 19 balls to reach eight and '
            'then another 17 to reach 40 and between them they dragged England '
            'to a total of 163 for four. Sri Lanka, so soundly beaten in '
            'England in June and July, are a rapidly improving side, and this '
            'was a compelling contest until the final minutes. Once again '
            'England took three wickets in the powerplay, but Sri Lanka '
            'remained on some kind of track to reach their target until a '
            'dramatic late implosion. Mills’s injury helped, the fast bowler '
            'pulling up halfway through the 14th over to force Morgan into an '
            'on-the-hoof rethink of England’s tactical plans. He settled on a '
            'devilishly cunning one: robbed of the man who often bowls the '
            '20th over, England ended the match in 19. Hasaranga was primarily '
            'responsible for keeping Sri Lanka’s hopes alive that long, the '
            '24-year-old scoring 34 off 21 and putting on 53 for the sixth '
            'wicket with his captain, Dasun Shanaka. But once he went the '
            'innings crumbled in a few chaotic minutes of wild hitting and '
            'superlative fielding. It started with Hasaranga scooping Liam '
            'Livingstone to long-off, where Jason Roy sprinted to his left and '
            'aware that he was heading inexorably towards the rope tossed the '
            'ball to the substitute fielder, Sam Billings, to complete the '
            'catch.\n'
            'Four balls later Shanaka was run out by Buttler, running around '
            'from behind the stumps, flinging off his gloves as he went, '
            'before hitting the stumps from 15 yards. Three catches in the '
            'deep later 129 for five had become 137 all out. Sri Lanka had '
            'shown that England are fallible, but they could not make them '
            'fall.',

{'article': 'Prince Andrew’s attacks on Virginia Giuffre’s character in an '
            'attempt to get her sexual assault lawsuit against him thrown out '
            'may fail and risk doing further damage to his reputation, British '
            'lawyers have said. Having initially attempted to prevent service '
            'of the suit, which alleges that he sexually abused Giuffre when '
            'she was 17, the prince’s lawyers went on the offensive over the '
            'weekend in an attempt to get her “baseless” claim dismissed. '
            'Their filings accuse Giuffre of seeking a “payday” at Andrew’s '
            'expense and contain references from friends and in newspaper '
            'articles to her being a “money hungry sex kitten” and recruiting '
            'girls for the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who died '
            'in custody in 2019, awaiting trial. At the same time they argue '
            'that a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein, '
            'formerly a friend of Andrew, absolves the prince from '
            'responsibility, a notion rejected by Giuffre’s lawyer. Mark '
            'Stephens, a partner at Howard Kennedy and UK media law expert, '
            'said it would take a brave judge to dismiss the case and '
            'suggested Prince Andrew had potentially opened himself up to '
            'further embarrassment. “He’s obviously got fed up with the '
            'criticism that he’s taken so he has instructed lawyers to '
            'engage,” said Stephens. “The problem of course, is that he’s now '
            'embarked on a route towards a case. He’s saying it should be '
            'struck out because she’s unreliable but also that he’s covered by '
            'the plea deal from Epstein in any event, which seemed to be sort '
            'of contradictory. “The problem you’ve got is he clearly as a '
            'human being wants to explain himself, he wants to make clear that '
            'he’s not responsible but his only way of doing that is in the '
            'court hearing. And if he does that, he has to get into what he '
            'actually did with her, how did the photograph [with Giuffre] come '
            'to be taken etc [allies of Andrew have claimed the photo was '
            'faked and he says he has “no recollection” of meeting her] and '
            'she will undoubtedly give graphic and detailed evidence about '
            'what she says were their liaisons”. Andrew, 61, has “absolutely '
            'and categorically” denied having sex with Giuffre but the '
            'allegations have already done huge damage to his reputation. The '
            'Queen’s second son stepped back from royal duties in 2019 in the '
            'aftermath of a disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC’s '
            'Newsnight in which he was perceived as unsympathetic towards '
            'Epstein’s victims. His lawyers’ latest strategy risks '
            'exacerbating that perception, according to a senior partner at a '
            'leading London law firm, who described the allegations in the '
            'filings as a “smokescreen”. The solicitor, who did not want to be '
            'named, said: “This looks like putting up a smokescreen to tarnish '
            'her [Giuffre’s] reputation but it has no legal relevance '
            'whatsoever. Whether or not she was complicit in assisting Epstein '
            'with his child abuse is neither here nor there when you consider '
            'the allegations against Prince Andrew, which are that he raped '
            'and molested her. However he tarnishes her character, it makes '
            'absolutely no difference to that issue.” He said an English judge '
            'would ignore it and while there was more chance of US jurors '
            'being swayed by it, there was no guarantee. “A jury might think, '
            '‘This is an American citizen, and who’s this prince trying to '
            'blacken the character of one of our own?’, so it’s a high-risk '
            'strategy even with a jury, I would have thought,” he said. In her '
            'lawsuit, Giuffre alleged the prince “stonewalled”, rejecting a '
            'request to explore alternative dispute resolution. The attempts '
            'to challenge service and jurisdiction further raised uncertainty '
            'about his level of engagement with the case but Richard Spafford, '
            'partner at Reed Smith, said it was “fairly standard” to try to '
            'stop the lawsuit in its tracks and only when those tactics '
            'failed, address the actual merits of the case. “I can only assume '
            'that it’s been decided within his advisory team that, '
            'notwithstanding the fact that his application will attract '
            'publicity, that it’s nonetheless the appropriate step to take,” '
            'said Spafford. “On the basis of that there must be a view that '
            'these arguments raise the possibility that the case will be '
            'dismissed by the judge, or, alternatively, that the plaintiff may '
            'be more likely to conclude that it’s appropriate to settle it.” '
            'Thomas Garner, partner at Fladgate, said the attacks on Giuffre '
            'showed the gloves were off even if it might do “irreparable” '
            'damage to the prince’s reputation. “If there was any doubt as to '
            'how he would handle the claim, this application makes it clear '
            'that if [the judge] doesn’t dismiss the claim then Prince Andrew '
            'intends to go on the attack,” he said.',

{'article': '“Progress in AI is something that will take a while to happen, '
            'but [that] doesn’t make it science fiction.” So Stuart Russell, '
            'the University of California computing professor, told the '
            'Guardian at the weekend. The scientist said researchers had been '
            '“spooked” by their own success in the field. Prof Russell, the '
            'co-author of the top artificial intelligence (AI) textbook, is '
            'giving this year’s BBC’s Reith lectures – which have just begun – '
            'and his doubts appear increasingly relevant. With little debate '
            'about its downsides, AI is becoming embedded in society. Machines '
            'now recommend online videos to watch, perform surgery and send '
            'people to jail. The science of AI is a human enterprise that '
            'requires social limitations. The risks, however, are not being '
            'properly weighed. There are two emerging approaches to AI. The '
            'first is to view it in engineering terms, where algorithms are '
            'trained on specific tasks. The second presents deeper '
            'philosophical questions about the nature of human knowledge. Prof '
            'Russell engages with both these perspectives. The former is very '
            'much pushed by Silicon Valley, where AI is deployed to get '
            'products quickly to market and problems dealt with later. This '
            'has led to AI “succeeding” even when the goals aren’t socially '
            'acceptable and they are pursued with little accountability. The '
            'pitfalls of this approach are highlighted by the role YouTube’s '
            'algorithm plays in radicalising people, given that there is no '
            'public understanding of how it works. Prof Russell argues, '
            'reasonably, for a system of checks where machines can pause and '
            '“ask” for human guidance, and for regulations to deal with '
            'systemic biases. The academic also backs global adoption of EU '
            'legislation that would ban impersonation of humans by machines. '
            'Computers are getting closer to passing, in a superficial way, '
            'the Turing test – where machines attempt to trick people into '
            'believing they are communicating with other humans. Yet human '
            'knowledge is collective: to truly fool humans a computer would '
            'have to be able to grasp mutual understandings. OpenAI’s GPT-3, '
            'probably the best non-human writer ever, cannot comprehend what '
            'it spews. When Oxford scientists put it – and similar AIs – to '
            'the test this year, they found the machines produced false '
            'answers to questions that “mimic popular misconceptions and have '
            'the potential to deceive”. It so troubled one of OpenAI’s own '
            'researchers that no one knew how such language is being made that '
            'he left to set up an AI safety lab. Some argue that AI can '
            'already produce new insights that humans have missed. But human '
            'intelligence is much more than an algorithm. Inspiration strikes '
            'when a brilliant thought arises that can’t be explained as a '
            'logical consequence of preceding steps. Einstein’s theory of '
            'general relativity cannot be derived from observations of that '
            'age – it was experimentally proven only decades later. Human '
            'beings can also learn a new task by being shown how to do it only '
            'a few times. Machines, so far, cannot. Currently, AI can be '
            'prompted – but not prompt itself – into action. Ajeya Cotra, a '
            'tech analyst with the US-based Open Philanthropy Project, '
            'reckoned a computer that could match the human brain might arrive '
            'by 2052 (and come with a $1tn price tag). We need to find better '
            'ways to build it. Humans are stumbling into an era when the more '
            'powerful the AI system, the harder it is to explain its actions. '
            'How can we tell if a machine is acting on our behalf and not '
            'acting contrary to our interests? Such questions ought to give us '
            'all pause for thought.',

            'resistance among a minority of workers in some critical public '
            'safety jobs, including police officers and firefighters, with a '
            'pending legal challenge to the mandate from the largest police '
            'union. As of Sunday, one in four of uniformed New York '
            'firefighters had not had a first dose of the vaccine, as '
            'required. About one in six police personnel and one in six '
            'sanitation workers were still unvaccinated. About 2,300 '
            'firefighters were out sick, up from a norm of around 1,000 a day, '
            'in what Nigro said appeared to be a protest against the vaccine '
            'mandate. The fire department medical office normally saw about '
            '200 people a day, Nigro said. Over the past week, it had been 700 '
            'a day, most of them unvaccinated. As officials prepared for '
            'staffing shortfalls, calling in vaccinated employees for overtime '
            'shifts, Nigro called on firefighters to stop misusing sick leave. '
            '“These are understaffed units,” he said. “That understaffing '
            'could end immediately if members stopped going sick when they '
            'weren’t sick. Once the members come to their senses and stop '
            'using medical leave improperly, they can help out not just the '
            'citizens of the city but their brothers and sisters staffing the '
            'units.” De Blasio said the city was watching to see if the '
            'firefighters union was coordinating the sick-outs and would take '
            'it to court if there was evidence of an illegal strike. He said '
            'firefighters found to be faking illness would be “awol '
            'effectively” and would face internal discipline. The head of the '
            'union that represents New York City firefighters, which has '
            'fought the vaccine mandate, warned that public safety could be at '
            'risk. The fire department has said it is prepared to take up to '
            '20% of companies out of service and have 20% fewer ambulances on '
            'the road.\n'
            '“We’re here today because of a mandate that was put not only on '
            'our members, but also all New York City employees, given nine '
            'days to make a life-changing decision on their career or whether '
            'or not they’re going to take a vaccine,” said the Uniformed '
            'Firefighters Association president, Andrew Ansbro. On Friday, six '
            'firefighters were suspended for four weeks without pay after they '
            'drove a fire engine to the Brooklyn office of a New York state '
            'senator, Zellnor Myrie, to protest the vaccine mandate. According '
            'to Myrie’s spokesman, Matt Baer, the firefighters asked to '
            'discuss the mandate. They asked where the senator lived and said '
            'the city would have blood on its hands due to the mandate. Over '
            'the weekend, numerous FDNY members also protested outside Gracie '
            'Mansion, the mayor’s residence. Signs read “Essential Workers '
            'aren’t Disposable Heroes”, “My Body My Choice” and '
            '“#NaturalImmunity”.',

{'article': 'The weekend seizure of two key towns on the main road to Addis '
            'Ababa has alarmed Ethiopian leaders who fear that the rapid '
            'advances by Tigrayan rebel forces may soon threaten the capital '
            'itself. The sudden push into the towns of Dessie and Kombolcha '
            'was accompanied by short bursts of intense fighting that had '
            'reportedly subsided by Monday evening. While Dessie was confirmed '
            'to have fallen to the rebels on Sunday, the fate of Kombolcha was '
            'less clear, with accounts of continuing sporadic gunfire. '
            'Nevertheless, the rebel offensive was the most decisive yet in '
            'the year-long conflict with Ethiopian government forces, and led '
            'the country’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to call for loyalists '
            'to double efforts to defend the seat of power. “Use any type of '
            'weapons to block the destructive [rebel push], to overturn it and '
            'bury it,” he said. “Dying for Ethiopia is a duty for all of us.” '
            'Government officials claimed, without offering evidence, that up '
            'to 100 youths had been executed during the Tigrayan takeover of '
            'Kombolcha – adding weight to rebel boasts of having seized '
            'control of the northern town. Kombolcha residents contacted by '
            'Agence France Presse described chaos as rebels approached. “The '
            'night was filled with many gunshots,” one man told the news '
            'agency. “I heard an airstrike past midnight outside Kombolcha '
            'borders.” A second man, Hamdiu, a shopkeeper in Kombolcha, said '
            'he heard what sounded like an airstrike in the late evening. '
            '“Huge gunshots were heard until morning”, he said. Federal '
            'government forces have frequently used airstrikes in the Tigray '
            'region as the war has ground on, but denied having done so in '
            'Kombolcha.\n'
            'As fears mounted of a continued push to Addis Ababa, 380km '
            'farther south, a spokesman for the Tigray Peoples Liberation '
            'Front (TPLF), Getachew Reda, denied the organisation had designs '
            'on the capital and claimed the offensive aimed only to break the '
            'government siege on the Tigray region, which had been imposed by '
            'Ahmed in 2019. The seeds of the fighting, which has sparked mass '
            'internal displacement and reports of a near-famine in some '
            'regions, were laid as Ahmed attempted to consolidate his '
            'authority, after taking power a year earlier, partly by merging '
            'opposition and regional political parties into his own. The TPLF, '
            'which had dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly three decades, '
            'refused to join and subsequently held regional elections that the '
            'Ahmed-led government declared illegal. Since fighting erupted in '
            '2021, it has drawn in troops from nearby Eritrea and Ethiopia’s '
            'Amhara region and threatened to spill even further throughout the '
            'country and across its borders to Sudan and Somalia. The war has '
            'led to frequent claims of rapes, massacre, enslavement and '
            'widespread humanitarian abuses. Chronicling the suffering has '
            'been all but impossible, with most aid agencies, including the '
            'UN, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Norwegian Refugee Council, '
            'banned from the country, and journalists forbidden from covering '
            'the fighting. Agencies have estimated that about 4.5 million '
            'people are in need of aid, and about 1 million are in areas that '
            'are inaccessible. In June, the UN estimated that 400,000 people '
            'were already at risk of famine-like conditions. International '
            'reaction to the Tigrayan advance has been restrained. The US '
            'secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington was alarmed '
            'by the “reports of the TPLF takeover of Dessie and Kombolcha. '
            '“Continued fighting prolongs the dire humanitarian crisis in '
            'northern Ethiopia,” he said on Twitter. Regional authorities in '
            'Amhara had earlier estimated that almost 250,000 people had taken '
            'refuge in both towns, having fled fighting elsewhere in the '
            'country. Officials in Amhara on Monday ordered government '
            'institutions to stop work and join the war effort. Before Ahmed '
            'took power, Tigrayans had held sway over much of the Ethiopian '
            'military and had brought much of that power to bear on the '
            'battlefields. Government forces, however, have control of the '
            'skies and widespread reports have emerged of Ahmed’s war effort '
            'being supported by drones supplied by the United Arab Emirates '

{'article': 'When the UK landed the Cop26 presidency two years ago, Boris '
            'Johnson sensed a huge opportunity to showcase the UK on the world '
            'stage. The conference fit his post-Brexit vision of a “global '
            'Britain”, free of the EU and still a player on the world stage. '
            'He believed “Glasgow” would be remembered as a historic '
            'gathering, like the previous landmark climate summits in Kyoto '
            'and Paris. As recently as the end of September, Johnson told the '
            'UN general assembly in New York that the Glasgow summit should be '
            'a “turning point”. But then a week ago he began to scale down '
            'expectations, admitting success was “touch and go”. Johnson’s '
            'characteristic optimism blinded him to the uphill struggle he '
            'still faces. Previous landmark Cops succeeded through strong '
            'leadership, top-level political engagement and the hard graft of '
            'diplomacy over fine detail. Glasgow can still be a success, but '
            'not on the basis of the sort of empty sloganeering that brought '
            'us global Britain. Johnson is by nature a proponent of big '
            'promises. Initially, it was said, he had toyed with the idea of '
            'going further than Paris by beefing up its 1.5C wording. This '
            'would be against the wishes of his Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, '
            'the former business secretary, who was said to have expressed '
            'frustration at Johnson’s overpromising. Johnson is also accused '
            'of not engaging fully with Cop26 until relatively late in the day '
            '– in contrast to Laurent Fabius, the former French prime minister '
            'who chaired the Paris conference, and Gordon Brown, the UK prime '
            'minister who travelled the world before hosting a successful '
            'London summit during the financial crisis. Sharma himself was not '
            'Johnson’s choice for the role; he had previously approached David '
            'Cameron and William Hague. Johnson’s holiday in Spain last month '
            'also came at a critical moment in the run-up to Glasgow and '
            'raised eyebrows in Whitehall. Senior UK officials insist progress '
            'had already been made. Only 30% of the world economy had '
            'committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of '
            'the century, when the UK took over the rotating Cop presidency, a '
            'figure that has risen to 80%. However, the countries signed up to '
            'the 1.5C limit account for about 65% of global GDP, leaving a big '
            'gap to bridge. Crucially, the UN’s assessment of the nationally '
            'determined contributions offered by individual nations shows that '
            'they still leave global temperatures on track to rise by 2.7C. '
            'Johnson’s critics argue he has been too focused on the 2050 '
            'target when he should have put more energy into securing the '
            'halving of emissions required by 2030; they are on course to fall '
            'by only 7.5%, according to the UN. Some insiders see this as an '
            'example of his looking at the big picture rather than mastering '
            'the detail. He has also been stymied by poor relations with other '
            'world leaders, something that doesn’t bode well for the '
            'negotiations in the coming weeks. Brexit has left a legacy of '
            'trust issues. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has warned '
            'that the dispute with the UK over fishing rights is a test of '
            'Johnson’s “credibility” on the world stage. In London, this was '
            'seen as deliberately timed to embarrass Johnson as he prepared to '
            'host Cop26. “He is trying to rain on our parade,” one Tory MP '
            'claimed. And despite the need to win the trust of the poorest '
            'countries, the UK’s Cop presidency has been undermined by the '
            'government’s controversial decision to trim £4bn a year from '
            'overseas aid in the middle of a pandemic. “It has fuelled the '
            'trust problem,” one Whitehall source told me. Another insider '
            'admitted: “It’s a bad advert for global Britain.” Rishi Sunak did '
            'not use any of the £50bn at his disposal in last week’s budget to '
            'reverse the cut before 2024-25. However, all is not lost for '
            'Johnson. His government’s ambitious strategy to achieve net zero '
            'emissions by 2050 has passed the credibility test and given him '
            'the clout needed to progress-chase at Cop26. In his opening '
            'speech this morning, he indulged his flair for the dramatic, '
            'warning of a James Bond-like Doomsday Clock set at “one minute to '
            'midnight”, and that “aspirations” must now be matched by '
            '“action”. He will point to movement by the rich nations towards '
            'their promise to provide $100bn a year to help poor countries '
            'cope with climate breakdown, although it will arrive three years '
            'late, in 2023. He also expressed hope the summit will agree a '
            'landmark deal to halt global deforestation by 2030 and reduce '
            'methane emissions by a third by 2030. Not the blockbuster '
            'announcements of Paris or Kyoto, but real progress on important '
            'details left unfinished by previous summits. This progress '
            'depends on many factors coming together. Without more movement by '
            'China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, overall momentum '
            'will stall. “India is unlikely to jump unless China does,” said '
            'one UK official. The outcome in Glasgow might depend on the '
            'last-minute efforts of John Kerry, the US climate envoy, to '
            'extract concessions from China. When Johnson spoke to President '
            'Xi Jinping on Friday, he rebuffed the prime minister’s call for '
            'China to bring forward its emissions peak from 2030 to 2025. '
            'Johnson hopes to be able to argue this summit kept the 1.5C '
            'target alive, even while admitting much more needs to be done '
            'over the next few years to achieve it. This Cop is one where the '
            'big announcements of previous conferences need to be backed up by '
            'the concrete details and deals needed to achieve them. This is '
            'not really Johnson’s style. But, were he to pull it off, it would '
            'be a big achievement for climate politics and a signal that '
            'Britain is a responsible global player. One idea being toyed with '
            'by the UK government is for world leaders to review progress '
            'against targets more frequently, perhaps every year or two years, '
            'to ensure more action is taken in the current “decisive decade”. '
            'Cop26 might prove a stepping stone, but the word “Glasgow” is '
            'unlikely to be remembered as the triumph for global Britain '
            'Johnson hoped for in the heady days of 2019. Mujtaba Rahman is '

{'article': 'Boris Johnson is flying back from the Cop26 climate conference on '
            'a private plane rather than the train after spending two days '
            'warning world leaders to reduce their emissions. The prime '
            'minister left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after '
            'urging other countries to do everything possible to pledge lower '
            'emissions and warning that they would be judged by their children '
            'if they fail to act. Johnson flew into Cop26 in Glasgow from Rome '
            'after attending the G20 of world leaders. But instead of getting '
            'the train, which takes about four and a half hours, he has '
            'decided to take a short internal flight from Glasgow to London. '
            'Earlier, he told a roundtable of leaders of developing nations: '
            '“When it comes to tackling climate change, words without action, '
            'without deeds are absolutely pointless.” The prime minister is '
            'one of hundreds of world leaders and businesspeople who have '
            'chartered planes to attend the conference aimed at limiting '
            'global temperature rises to less than 1.5C. Jeff Bezos, the boss '
            'of Amazon, was one of those who flew in to Scotland for the '
            'conference. Johnson’s spokesperson defended the move, saying the '
            'plane ran partly on “sustainable aviation fuel” and emitted about '
            'half the emissions of other aircraft. The plane will still cause '
            'far more emissions than a trip by train. “It’s important the PM '
            'is able to move around the country. We have obviously faced '
            'significant time constraints,” Johnson’s official spokesperson '
            'said. The plane – an Airbus A321 – appears to have been leased '
            'from a company called Titan Airways, while the prime minister’s '
            'usual Voyager is being serviced. His spokesperson said: “The '
            'plane is one of the most carbon-efficient planes of its size in '
            'the world. It produces 50% less CO2 emissions than, for example, '
            'the larger Voyager plane.” Prince Charles also flew from Rome to '
            'Glasgow on a private plane separately from the prime minister. It '
            'also used sustainable aviation fuel – a mixture of conventional '
            'fuel and biofuel.',

            'of the 30s, of the politicians who ignored what was happening in '
            'Nazi Germany, because this will kill people all around the world '
            'for generations, and we will have no means of averting it.” Asked '
            'if he was arguing that a failure to tackle the climate crisis '
            'would be worse than not stopping genocide, Welby said: “It will '
            'allow a genocide on an infinitely greater scale. I’m not sure '
            'there’s grades of genocide, but there’s width of genocide, and '
            'this will be genocide indirectly, by negligence, recklessness, '
            'that will in the end come back to us or to our children and '
            'grandchildren.” But in a subsequent tweet, Welby wrote: “I '
            'unequivocally apologise for the words I used when trying to '
            'emphasise the gravity of the situation facing us at Cop26. It’s '
            'never right to make comparisons with the atrocities brought by '
            'the Nazis, and I’m sorry for the offence caused to Jews by these '
            'words.” In the interview, Welby was asked what sort of '
            'commitments he was seeking from the leaders at Cop26, with the '
            'archbishop saying that one key thing was providing sufficient '
            'money for developing nations. “All moral thinking starts with the '
            'idea that if you’re going to do the right thing, it needs action: '
            'money,” he said. “Are they going to reach the amounts of money '
            'committed – the $100bn a year – which is a fraction of what was '
            'paid out during the great banking crisis, in 2008-9 – are they '
            'going to reach the amount of money that actually says we’re '
            'serious about this?”',

{'article': 'Thomas Tuchel wants us to think differently. The statistic shows '
            'that half Chelsea’s 26 goals in the Premier League and Champions '
            'League have come from defenders this season, but Tuchel has an '
            'alternative way of viewing the numbers after seeing Reece James '
            'rumble up the right flank to score two cracking goals during '
            'Saturday’s 3-0 victory at Newcastle. According to the German, the '
            'trend is a consequence of the positional freedom he has given to '
            'his wing-backs. Tuchel has even come to see Marcos Alonso, Ben '
            'Chilwell and James as midfielders rather than defenders and, in '
            'any case, it is hardly as if the European champions expected a '
            'large portion of their goals to come from the back after spending '
            '£97.5m on Romelu Lukaku in the summer.\n'
            '“If you want to reach the highest level in any competition you '
            'need consistent goalscoring threat from your strikers,” Tuchel '
            'said, speaking as he prepared for Chelsea’s visit to Malmö in the '
            'Champions League on Tuesday night. “We hope we can have our '
            'strikers at the end of the season on top of the list.” It is a '
            'regular refrain from Tuchel, who knew something had to change '
            'after Jorginho finished last season as Chelsea’s top scorer in '
            'the Premier League, with seven goals. He thought an elite forward '
            'was required if Chelsea were going to challenge for the title, '
            'and signing Lukaku, who had enjoyed two prolific campaigns for '
            'Internazionale, was supposed to be the final piece in the jigsaw. '
            'However it has not quite clicked yet for the Belgian, who had '
            'four goals from 11 appearances before twisting an ankle during '
            'last month’s 4-0 win over Malmö at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian '
            'will not return until after the international break and, to '
            'complicate matters, the hamstrung Timo Werner and the unwell '
            'Mason Mount will also be absent against the Swedish champions.\n'
            'At least Christian Pulisic has travelled after a persistent ankle '
            'problem. The American winger is a threat in the box and his '
            'return is a boost for Tuchel, who started with Kai Havertz, '
            'Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech in attack against Newcastle. '
            'Yet it is not just about the forwards. Chelsea have goals from '
            'all over the pitch. James has four, Chilwell has three and Trevoh '
            'Chalobah has two. Alonso, Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rüdiger '
            'and Thiago Silva have one each. This is a versatile team, notable '
            'for Rüdiger’s runs from centre-back, and Tuchel is delighted when '
            'he sees Chilwell and James threatening on the flanks. “The '
            'statistic would look a bit different if you maybe interpret the '
            'wing-backs more as midfielders,” said the manager, who is without '
            'N’Golo Kanté because of muscle tightness. “If you play in a back '
            'three it is not really a full-back position and there are more '
            'midfield positions.\n'
            '“I would not call them defenders. Although they have to defend in '
            'some moments they are more free to attack as they have a shorter '
            'distance to goal than they would do as a full-back. It is '
            'necessary that they are included and that we bring them to the '
            'box at the end of our attacks to increase the goal threat. I am '
            'happy when we create chances and when we have five or six players '
            'in the box to be dangerous.” All the same Chelsea, second in '
            'Group H with six points from three games, need more from their '
            'forwards. Havertz and Ziyech have to become more consistent and '
            'Tuchel wants Hudson-Odoi to push on after three consecutive '
            'starts. “It’s all about performance and this is what Callum shows '
            'at the moment,” he said. “It’s important he shows consistency, '
            'stays hungry and keeps progressing.”',

{'article': 'India will meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070, the '
            'country’s prime minister has told the Cop26 global climate '
            'summit. Speaking at the world leaders’ summit at the UN '
            'conference in Glasgow, Narendra Modi made five key pledges for '
            'how India would decarbonise over the next few decades. India, a '
            'developing country of more than 1.3 billion people, is the '
            'world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide after the US and '
            'China. India was one of the last remaining major economies that '
            'had held out on a net zero commitment, despite months of pressure '
            'from the US, and Modi’s announcement marked one of the most '
            'significant moments of the summit’s opening day. Modi also made '
            'significant shorter-term commitments, promising to have 50% of '
            'India’s power generated by renewable energy by 2030, increase its '
            'non-fossil energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 and reduce its '
            'projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030. By '
            '2030, he also committed to a 45% reduction in the carbon '
            'intensity of the economy. While the 2070 net zero target falls '
            'behind the 2050 commitment made by the US and Europe and the 2060 '
            'commitment made by China and Saudi Arabia, it is in line with '
            'what many climate experts have modelled as the most feasible '
            'scenario for India to achieve net zero. A recent report released '
            'by the Delhi-based thinktank the Council on Energy, Environment '
            'and Water (CEEW) put forward 2070 to 2080 as India’s most '
            'realistic roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality. “India has '
            'clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world,” said '
            'Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of CEEW. “This is real '
            'climate action.” Unlike countries in the west, and even China, '
            'India is decades away from its peak in terms of economic growth '
            'and energy consumption, and India’s energy demand is expected to '
            'grow faster than any other country over the next few years. Its '
            'population is also expected to overtake that of China to make it '
            'the largest in the world. Currently, 70% of all power in India is '
            'generated by coal, and while it is one of the cheapest producers '
            'of solar energy in the world, there is still not the technology '
            'available to integrate it into the energy grid on a large scale. '
            'Advancements in hydrogen technology and storage will also be '
            'needed to help India’s industrial sector wean itself off coal, '
            'which is unlikely to happen until around 2040, according to '
            'experts. India is already bearing the harsh consequences of '
            'climate breakdown. Millions across the country are exposed to '
            'severe heat, water shortages, extreme weather events such as '
            'flooding and coastal erosion, which have all been increasing in '
            'recent years. In the build-up to the conference, Indian officials '
            'had appeared to rebuff calls to commit to net zero, emphasising '
            'instead the need for climate funding and climate justice for '
            'developing countries, who historically have emitted far less '
            'greenhouses gas than countries such as the US but are now bearing '
            'the economic costs that come with net zero commitments.\n'
            'The commitments drew praise from the eminent climate ecologist '
            'Nicholas Stern, who said: “This was a very significant moment for '
            'the summit. [The action] might mean that India’s annual emissions '
            'of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030. This demonstrates real '
            'leadership from a country whose emissions per capita are about '
            'one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond '
            '[and] deliver a strong increase in international climate '
            'finance.” In his speech, Modi called out previous commitments of '
            'climate finance as “hollow” and demanded developed countries make '
            '$1tn available as climate finance to developing countries “as '
            'soon as possible today”. Modi told his fellow world leaders: “I '
            'am sure that the decisions taken in Glasgow will safeguard the '
            'future of generations to come and give them a safe and prosperous '
            'life.” He apologised for running over his allotted speech time '
            'but said he believed it was his “duty to raise my voice for '
            'developing countries”.',

{'article': 'The effort to combat toxic masculinity in the US has led men to '
            'consume more pornography and play more video games, the Missouri '
            'senator Josh Hawley claimed in a speech to a group of '
            'Republicans. Speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in '
            'Orlando, Florida, Hawley addressed the issue of “manhood”, which '
            'he said was under attack, and called for men to return to '
            'traditional masculine roles. The Donald Trump supporter who '
            'notoriously raised a fist in support of a mob outside the US '
            'Capitol on 6 January appeared to echo talking points made by the '
            'likes of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that opposes feminism '
            'and believes men are under attack from liberal elites. “Can we be '
            'surprised that after years of being told that they are the '
            'problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are '
            'withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and '
            'video games?” Hawley said. “While the left may celebrate this '
            'decline of men, I for one cannot join them. No one should.” '
            'Hawley, 41, did not cite sources for his belief that men were '
            'watching pornography more frequently. Nonetheless, on Monday his '
            'speech was republished by the Federalist, a rightwing outlet. In '
            'the address, Hawley said he wanted to discuss “the left’s attempt '
            'to give us a world beyond men”. “The left want to define '
            'traditional masculinity as toxic,” he said. “They want to define '
            'the traditional masculine virtues – things like courage, and '
            'independence, and assertiveness – as a danger to society.” Hawley '
            'is the son of a banker who attended private school before '
            'studying at Stanford and Yale. He clerked for the supreme court’s '
            'chief justice, John Roberts, and later became a law professor. '
            'Given his background, he has repeatedly raised eyebrows for '
            'railing against elites. Hawley’s apparent claim to speak for all '
            'men, in the name of a return to a vaguely defined masculinity of '
            'old, swiftly became a new subject of ridicule on Twitter.\n'
            'Hawley, who was a staunch defender of Brett Kavanaugh when he was '
            'accused of sexual assault during his supreme court nomination '
            'hearings in 2018, claimed: “Boys are increasingly treated like an '
            'illness in search of a cure.” “Hollywood delivers the toxic '
            'masculinity theme ad nauseum in television and film,” he said, '
            'going on to link traditional masculinity as “vital to '
            'self-government”. “Observers from the ancient Romans to our '
            'forefathers identified the manly virtues as indispensable for '
            'political liberty,” Hawley said. As well as pornography, Hawley '
            'tied the supposed decline in masculinity to issues including '
            'unemployment, people marrying at a later age and the preservation '
            'of liberty. Hawley said: “For centuries, lovers of liberty have '
            'praised these qualities as the highest standard of manhood. '
            'That’s not to say that women don’t possess them. But it is to say '
            'that these virtues are the bright side of the aggression and '
            'competitiveness and independence that psychologists, no less than '
            'philosophers, have long observed in men. “Assertiveness and '
            'independence are strengths when used to protect and empower '
            'others.” Hawley offered few solutions to the problems he claimed '
            'to present. On Monday, he used Twitter to promote his new '
            'podcast, co-hosted with his wife. “In the second episode of This '
            'is Living, Josh and Erin Hawley share the story of how they met, '
            'what drew them to each other, and how two people so different '
            'decided to get married,” a blurb for the podcast reads. The '
            'Hawleys met while studying law at Yale. Erin Hawley also clerked '
            'for Roberts and became a law professor.',

{'article': 'Pamela Rose, who has died aged 103, landed her first significant '
            'role as an actor on the London stage in 1941, under her maiden '
            'name, Pamela Gibson, but it would be another 60 years before she '
            'made her West End debut. Instead she took her language skills to '
            'the secret wartime codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park in '
            'Buckinghamshire, where she ran Naval Hut 4’s indexing section. '
            'Later, she had little truck with the media glare Bletchley '
            'attracted: “It was something of a disappointment to a young woman '
            'and definitely a cushy berth”, but conceded that “a common enemy '
            'draws people together like nothing else”. As part of the forces '
            'entertainment programme Ensa, Pamela had begun the second world '
            'war in a reserved occupation, acting in Bournemouth and then at '
            'the Prince of Wales theatre in Birmingham. She was frustrated by '
            'Ensa’s below par productions, so it was welcome news that she had '
            'been offered her first West End role in Watch on the Rhine. In '
            'the meantime came an approach through a family friend: “I know '
            'you are doing splendid work entertaining the troops but there is '
            'a place where they want girls exactly like you. Here’s the '
            'address …” Part of the social network through which Bletchley '
            'Park recruited its cohort of civilian women and with good German, '
            'Pamela impressed her interviewer, Frank Birch, a '
            'thespian-academic working in naval intelligence. Torn between the '
            'West End and the prospect of unspecified secret war work she '
            'sought Birch’s advice. His answer was unequivocal: “The stage can '
            'wait, the war can’t.” Pamela thought at first that “I was going '
            'to be dropped from an aeroplane into Germany. Goodness knows my '
            'German wasn’t really good enough for that but one has exalted '
            'ideas when one is young.” Her arrival at Bletchley Park was an '
            'anticlimax for the 24-year-old, but her utility was not in '
            'question. A linguist in the indexing section of Naval Hut 4, she '
            'was the recipient of decoded German messages from which all '
            'significant information had to be recorded and indexed. It was '
            'assiduous work that required a good memory. “Requests for the '
            'latest movements of a German battleship had to be accessed and '
            'cross-referenced with all other relevant information.”\n'
            'Pamela was quickly promoted to index leader of this unprecedented '
            'data system (pre-microchip and housed on cards) and given the '
            'task of managing a clutch of former debutantes who included the '
            'wild Jean Campbell-Harris, later Lady Trumpington. She attended '
            'section head meetings and was privy to a level of knowledge about '
            'the code-breaking nexus that most women were not. Among her '
            'female peers, many of whom were just out of school, she made an '
            'impression. One Bletchley recruit, Rozanne Colchester, remembered '
            'a woman on “the verge of being a rebel. She was more than '
            'stylish, she had her own style. And she was terribly brainy, '
            'creative and very quick at picking up languages.” Pamela was born '
            'in London into a family in which musical performance was the '
            'governing force. Her father, Thornley Gibson, was an opera singer '
            'and her mother, Dolly (nee Coit), was also passionate about '
            'music. Growing up Pamela recalled PWE – “pleasant Wednesday '
            'evenings” – when her parents orchestrated musical gatherings on '
            'gold chairs and she and her brother were occasionally expected to '
            'perform. She was sent off to boarding school aged six, at '
            'Broadstairs preparatory school, then Westonbirt school for girls, '
            'in Gloucestershire, and elocution lessons reinforced her ambition '
            'to become an actor. A self-reliant child, she told herself: '
            '“Whatever happens I have always got me. I remember thinking that '
            'was quite a comfort.” A reluctant debutante, Pamela left the 1936 '
            'season early to cycle to France, where the Moulin Rouge singer '
            'Yvette Guilbert taught her French and cabaret performance. '
            'Staying in Munich a year later to hone her German, with '
            'characteristic candour she later said: “I’m ashamed to say I '
            'don’t think I was aware of the ghastly things that were going on. '
            'I was like so many young people, preoccupied with myself. I '
            'wanted to get back to London and act.” She enrolled on a Webber '
            'Douglas course and did just that, and even at Bletchley Park '
            'channelled her acting into theatrical revues. “I directed '
            'Candida, by George Bernard Shaw. I didn’t want anything too '
            'experimental; we had to bear in mind the ability of the actors.” '
            'She might have returned to the stage after the war but meeting '
            'Wing Commander Jim Rose at the Park changed that. They married in '
            '1946. After the war, Jim became a journalist and founded the '
            'International Press Institute in the 1950s. Pamela recalled that '
            'he told her: “‘If you go back on the stage you’ll be going out to '
            'work just as I am coming in’ so I gave up acting. I wanted to '
            'spend my life with Jim and I thought you can’t have everything. I '
            'doubt I would’ve thought like that now but one is conditioned by '
            'the way others think and I was a product of my time.” She ran a '
            'mentoring scheme for African-Caribbean children in a London '
            'comprehensive school, was vice-chair of the NSPCC and served as '
            'chair of the Stroke Association. Jim died in 1999, and she '
            'finally appeared on the West End stage later that year, in Lady '
            'Windermere’s Fan. “It was terrifying but great fun and it helped '
            'subdue the grief.” I met her while writing The Bletchley Girls '
            '(2015) and that year she appeared as a castaway on Radio 4’s '
            'Desert Island Discs, aged 97. She attributed her long life to '
            '“luck, optimism and a great belief in the human spirit”. Pamela '
            'is survived by her daughter, Harriet, and son, Alan, five '
            'grandchildren, Chloe, Charlotte, Matthew, Clare and Hannah, and '
            'six great-grandchildren. • Pamela Rose, wartime indexer and '

{'article': 'Joe Biden has warned that the climate crisis poses “the '
            'existential threat to human existence as we know it” and urged '
            'other world leaders to embark upon a transformational shift to '
            'clean energy, as questions linger over the US president’s ability '
            'to deliver this vision at home.\n'
            'Biden, addressing a sparse chamber at crucial UN climate talks '
            'that have begun in a frigid and drizzly Glasgow, said that the '
            'conference must act as a “kickoff of a decade of ambition and '
            'innovation to preserve our shared future”. The president added: '
            '“We meet with the eyes of history upon us. Will we do what is '
            'necessary? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?” '
            'Biden’s administration is attempting to reassert America’s '
            'credibility at the gathering of nearly 200 countries in Scotland, '
            'known as Cop26, after Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US from '
            'the Paris climate agreement and his dismissal of climate science. '
            'Scientists have warned the world is badly off track to avoid '
            'disastrous climate change, with leaders of poorer, vulnerable '
            'countries using the talks to warn their populations face looming '
            'cataclysm. “We will demonstrate to the world the United States is '
            'not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of '
            'our example,” Biden said in his speech, in a tacit '
            'acknowledgement of Trump. “I know it hasn’t been the case, which '
            'is why my administration is working overtime to show our climate '
            'commitment is action not words.” “Right now, we are falling '
            'short, there’s no time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue '
            'amongst ourselves,” the president continued. “This is the '
            'challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to '
            'human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of '
            'inaction increases.” Biden said that wealthy, major polluters '
            'such as the US have an “overwhelming responsibility” to aid '
            'smaller countries that are struggling to cope with growing '
            'floods, fires and heatwaves spurred by global heating. Before '
            'arriving in Glasgow, Biden also took aim at some other leading '
            'emitters for not doing enough to prevent global heating '
            'surpassing 1.5C. He said these countries are “not only Russia but '
            'China (which) basically didn’t show up in terms of commitments to '
            'deal with climate change. I found it disappointing myself”. At a '
            'side event, Biden also effectively apologized for his '
            'predecessor. “I guess I shouldn’t apologize, but I do apologize '
            'for the fact that the United States – the last administration – '
            'pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the '
            'eight ball,” Biden said. But climate activists, many of whom '
            'gathered outside the Glasgow venue that hosted more than 120 '
            'world leaders on Monday, argue that Biden is failing to live up '
            'to his own words. The president touted vast proposed climate '
            'legislation that would be the “most significant investment to '
            'deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made, '
            'ever,” but the bill remains stalled in Congress, after being '
            'winnowed away by a senator who has extensive ties to fossil '
            'fuels. “Biden is at Glasgow empty handed, with nothing but words '
            'on paper,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise '
            'Movement. “It is humiliating and fails to meet the moment that '
            'we’re in.” Biden has also been attacked over his administration’s '
            'reluctance to drastically scale back oil and gas drilling in the '
            'US. The president’s narrative of “climate leadership” contradicts '
            'the daily suffering by communities on the frontline of gas and '
            'oil production in the US, activists say. In the first six months '
            'of the Biden administration, about 2,500 new oil and gas permits '
            'were authorized – a figure Trump’s administration took a year to '
            'reach. Speakers outside Cop26 on Monday – only 23 civil society '
            'observers were allowed in to hear the leaders’ speeches – '
            'included Black and Indigenous leaders whose communities are on '
            'the frontline of fossil fuel extraction impacts, including air '
            'pollution and contaminated drinking water and land across the US. '
            'Tom Goldtooth, Native American leader from the Indigenous '
            'Environmental Network, said: “We’re here as the original people '
            'of the US to denounce the polluters conference – it’s not a '
            'climate conference – it’s been taken over by corporate interests. '
            'If we Indigenous people don’t come we’ll be on the menu. We’re '
            'here to defend our people, we want to live.” Biden’s speech came '
            'shortly after an official opening of Cop26 that acknowledged the '
            'growing anguish over the escalating, and largely unchecked, '
            'climate crisis. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said '
            '“the people who will judge us are children not yet born”, adding '
            '“if we fail they will not forgive us”. Antonio Guterres, the '
            'secretary general of the UN, warned that “we are digging our own '
            'graves” due to the failure to dramatically cut planet-heating '
            'emissions.',

{'article': 'If you have more money than sense, spending £850 on a '
            'gold-covered steak at a Knightsbridge restaurant is a perfectly '
            'reasonable thing to do. If you have more sense than money, then '
            'head to Durham or Sunderland. The breathtakingly expensive gold '
            'tomahawk steaks sold in the celebrity-packed restaurants of '
            'Nusret Gökçe, known as Salt Bae, have attracted many headlines '
            'and a fair degree of mockery. For John Stirk, a butcher and '
            'steakhouse owner, it prompted exasperation. “I love it when '
            'people post pictures of the food they’ve had and give us a good '
            'review. What annoys me about the restaurant in London is that '
            'there’s a lot more pictures of people posting receipts for how '
            'much they’ve paid for the food rather than the quality.” An '
            'example that went viral was a £37,023.10 receipt from the '
            'recently opened London branch of Bae’s Nusr-Et steakhouse chain. '
            'Top of the food bill was the £850 golden tomahawk. Stirk’s team '
            'have created their own version of the steak, which has been added '
            'to the menu at his restaurants in Belmont, near Durham, and '
            'Sunderland. It feeds two and it costs £100. “This time last year '
            'people couldn’t afford to feed their kids and now social media is '
            'full of receipts for how much they’ve spent at a restaurant,” '
            'said Stirk. “It just feels wrong. It doesn’t sit right with me. '
            '“For me it was about showing that the gold-covered steak could be '
            'done cheaper and could be done better. It doesn’t have to cost '
            'the earth.” Stirk said he was not saying £100 was cheap. “It’s '
            'not something you go out and have for your tea.” But if it was a '
            'special occasion, people might consider it, said Stirk, who has '
            'been surprised at how popular the golden steaks have been at his '
            'steakhouses. “The reaction has been out of this world. We sold '
            'about 30 over the weekend. The sentiment behind it wasn’t about '
            'putting a gold, flashy steak on our menu, it was about quality of '
            'food.”\n'
            'Stirk, a former contestant on the BBC show Young Butcher of the '
            'Year, is not alone in taking on Salt Bae. Gareth Mason, the head '
            'chef at Absolute bar and bistro in Westhoughton, Bolton, covered '
            'his signature whist pies in 24-carat gold to mock the “ludicrous” '
            'Salt Bae steak. Also covered in gold were carrots, chips and '
            'sausage and bacon butties. “It’s more Morecambe Bay than Salt '
            'Bae,” Mason said. “We’ve got the traditional Lancashire dishes '
            'covered in gold for a fraction of the price you’d pay at his '
            'restaurant.” As well as Stirk Bae and Morecambe Bae there has '
            'been Plant Bae, courtesy of the vegan food company THIS, which '
            'set up a food truck outside the Knightsbridge Nusr-Et restaurant '
            'handing out free vegan rolls. Andy Shovel, co-founder of THIS, '
            'said: “We felt sorry for all these people turning up for a nice '
            'meal and then being whacked with a massive bill. You shouldn’t '
            'have to sell your kidney or to have delicious food.”',

{'article': 'Earlier today I set you the following “three-dimensional” logic '
            'puzzles, a genre thought to have emerged decades ago in Hungary. '
            '(For more details about the Hungarian link here’s the story.) The '
            'idea is that the solution is mapped out on a three-dimensional '
            'grid. 1. Date night Andy, Bill, Chris, and Daniel are out tonight '
            'with their dates, Emily, Fran, Gina, and Huong. We have the '
            'following information. 1. Andy will go to the opera 2. Bill will '
            'spend the evening with Emily, 3. Chris would not want to go out '
            'with Gina, 4. Fran will see a movie 5. Gina will attend a '
            'workshop. We also know that one couple will see an art exhibit. '
            'Who will go out with whom, and what will they do? Solution Here’s '
            'what I hoped you would do, which is to draw a 3D grid like the '
            'one below with the four alternatives on each axis. It’s as if you '
            'are looking at cube directly at a corner, showing three faces.\n'
            'Once you have the grid, you go through the statements, inputting '
            'the information where you can. Statement 1 says that Andy goes to '
            'the opera. So you put a tick for Andy/opera, which appears on the '
            'right face of the cube. We need to assume that each date takes '
            'place in one location, so we can mark crosses in the cells '
            'Andy/movie, Andy/workshop and Andy/art, since we know he didn’t '
            'go to any of those places. Bill, Chris and Daniel don’t go to the '
            'opera, so the corresponding cells also gain an X. Statement 2 '
            'says that Bill goes with Emily, so the top face will get a tick '
            'in the cell for Bill/Emily. If you continue in this way, you will '
            'fill up the grid with ticks and crosses. Each face will have four '
            'ticks only, and none of these ticks will share the same row or '
            'column. Finally, you will reach the conclusion that Andy and '
            'Huong attend the opera, Bill and Emily hang out at the art '
            'exhibit, Chris and Fran enjoy a movie, and Daniel and Gina go '
            'wild at the workshop. 2. Condo conundrum When Mr and Mrs Verona '
            'opened the door to their condominium at 11am this morning, they '
            'saw a terrible sight: their beautiful home had been burgled. They '
            'called the police, who came over immediately. The upcoming '
            'investigation revealed the following. 1. There are six '
            'condominiums in the building, numbered 1 to 6, the Veronas owned '
            '#4. 2. The Veronas left their home at 6pm last night. 3. The '
            'night guard of the building, Mr. Safe, works from 6pm till 10am. '
            '4. There were six visitors in the building during last night: Mr '
            'A. Bream, Miss F. Green, Mr R. Hill, Dr T. Smith, Miss T. Taylor, '
            'and Mr Z. White. They all visited one of the six condominiums, '
            'each a different one, some time between 6pm and midnight. Mr. '
            'Safe could not recall, however, who visited which place; but he '
            'was sure that none of them stayed longer than an hour. '
            'Furthermore, they all stayed during different hours; the first '
            'one between 6pm and 7pm, the second between 7pm and 8pm, and so '
            'on. 5. Mr Bream was at a huge party at the country club. He '
            'arrived there at 8pm and stayed till midnight. 6. Miss Green was '
            'also at the country club; she arrived at 9pm and left with Mr '
            'Bream. 7. Mr Hill could not provide any credible alibi for the '
            'night before. 8. Miss Taylor was at her home watering her front '
            'yard between 7.45pm and 9pm. Several of her neighbors saw her. 9. '
            'Mr White was at the party at the country club. He arrived at 7pm '
            'and left at 10pm but, surprisingly, he came back again at 11pm '
            'and stayed till after midnight. 10. No one could enter the '
            'condominium without going through the lobby where Mr. Safe was '
            'stationed. 11. None of Dr. Smith’s, Miss Taylor’s, or Mr White’s '
            'fingerprints were found in condo #5. 12. Dr Smith could not have '
            'visited condos #1, #3, or #6. 13. Miss Green couldn’t have '
            'visited condos #3 and #6. 14. Mr Safe recalled that shortly '
            'before 8pm a visitor left either condo #1 or #4. 15. Nobody '
            'entered condos #5 and #6 before 7pm. 16. A visitor arrived at '
            '8pm, and entered condo #1, #3, or #6. 17. Nobody visited condos '
            '#2, #3, and #6 between 10pm and 11pm. Well, these were all the '
            'clues that the police investigation revealed during the first day '
            'of the investigation. Can they solve this terrible crime without '
            'further information? Solution This time you need to draw a 6 x 6 '
            'x 6 cube grid, with the suspects along one axis, and the condos '
            'and the time slots along the two other axes. Gradually fill in '
            'the cells until you deduce that fishy old Bream did it. I hope '
            'you enjoyed the puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks. Thanks to '
            'Béla Bajnok for today’s puzzles. He is is Professor of '
            'Mathematics at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania and director of '
            'American Mathematics Competitions. I set a puzzle here every two '
            'weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. '

{'article': 'Re-establish the team’s identity It been nearly two years since '
            'Mauricio Pochettino was dismissed after an awful start to the '
            '2019-20 season yet Tottenham have never really moved on from the '
            'manager who had led them to the Champions League final a few '
            'months earlier. Five of the side that started against Liverpool '
            'in Madrid remain at the club – Hugo Lloris, Harry Winks, Dele '
            'Alli, Son Heung-min and Harry Kane – but neither José Mourinho '
            'nor Nuno Espírito Santo was able to establish their imprint on a '
            'squad created by Pochettino and weakened by poor recruitment. The '
            'expected appointment of Antonio Conte is a statement of intent '
            'given the Italian’s vast experience of finding a winning formula, '
            'albeit often only in the short term. He demands that players '
            'stick to his plan; anyone who does not quickly finds themselves '
            'out in the cold.\n'
            'Introduce a new formation Conte usually favours a three-man '
            'defence with wing-backs – a system that has brought him league '
            'titles at Juventus, Chelsea and Internazionale. Nuno, during his '
            'brief spell in charge of Spurs, opted against a similar approach '
            'that served him so well at Wolves, but adapting to the likely '
            'change of formation will be crucial to Tottenham’s recovery. '
            'Whether Conte would be able to mould a solid backline from '
            'Cristian Romero, Eric Dier, Davinson Sánchez and Joe Rodon '
            'remains to be seen, although there are two potentially exciting '
            'wing-backs in Sergio Reguilón and Emerson Royal, even if both '
            'will be under pressure to improve their defensive performances. '
            'Strengthen midfield and finally replace Eriksen Tottenham’s main '
            'issue under Nuno was a lack of creativity in midfield: no club '
            'averages fewer shots per game in the Premier League and neither '
            'Alli nor Son has created a scoring chance. Finding an effective '
            'partner for Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in midfield and a creative '
            'outlet to finally replace Christian Eriksen, who joined Inter in '
            'January 2020, will be two of the most important challenges for '
            'Spurs. The Denmark international racked up 62 assists and 51 '
            'goals at the club and has not been replaced effectively, with '
            'Giovani Lo Celso, Tanguy Ndombele and Alli so far failing to step '
            'into his shoes. It will be intriguing to see whether Lo Celso, '
            'who has shown glimpses of his ability since arriving from Real '
            'Betis a few months before Pochettino’s sacking, can thrive under '
            'the new manager and whether there is any role for the other two.\n'
            'Get recruitment right Conte and Tottenham’s managing director of '
            'football, Fabio Paratici, enjoyed spectacular success in three '
            'seasons together at Juventus between 2011 and 2014 that yielded '
            'three Serie A titles and a record 102 points in the manager’s '
            'final campaign. Their relationship has been a key factor in '
            'attracting the 52-year-old former Italy manager for talks with '
            'Spurs and Conte would expect his compatriot to be on his side if '
            'it comes to discussing transfer budgets with a notoriously '
            'prudent chairman. Tottenham’s net spend over the past five '
            'seasons is £94.6m – one of the lowest in the Premier League – but '
            'the new manager will surely demand more investment, with several '
            'targets earmarked for January and Daniel Levy likely to come '
            'under pressure to match his manager’s ambition. Restore Harry '
            'Kane’s desire The hangover from a summer of doubt over the '
            'England captain’s future seeped into the start of the season and '
            'appears still to be affecting Kane. His return of one goal from '
            'nine Premier League appearances is partly down to the negative '
            'approach under Nuno and a lack of opportunities created by '
            'teammates but Tottenham’s star player has looked demotivated at '
            'times. In the short term, Kane will relish the opportunity of '
            'working with a manager who has made winning trophies a habit. But '
            'with less than three years remaining on the 28-year-old’s '
            'contract and with Kane having made no secret of his desire to '
            'leave for Manchester City, time is against Spurs to persuade Kane '
            'that the grass isn’t always greener.\n'
            'Win a trophy The drought that stretches back to 2008 and six '
            'permanent managers since Juande Ramos led Spurs to victory over '
            'Chelsea in the League Cup is always mentioned when a new face '
            'arrives. Coming through a tricky Carabao Cup quarter-final '
            'against West Ham in December could be Tottenham’s best chance of '
            'a trophy this season after defeat by Manchester City in the '
            '2020-21 final and the club will expect to go further than the '
            'fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2018. The new '
            'manager’s approach to the Europa Conference League may not be so '
            'warm. The new tournament could be viewed as one distraction too '
            'many. • This article was amended on 2 November 2021 to remove a '
            'reference to José Mourinho being manager of Tottenham for the '
            '2020-21 Carabao Cup final. Interim manager Ryan Mason was in '
            'charge after the sacking of Mourinho six days earlier.',

{'article': 'A lobbyist at a company with close connections to the '
            'Conservative party will help select the next chair of the media '
            'regulator, it has been announced, after ministers cleared the '
            'former Daily Mail editor to apply for the job for a second time. '
            'Michael Prescott, a former political editor of the Sunday Times, '
            'has been unveiled as the senior external interviewer who will '
            'work with the veteran civil servant Sue Gray to decide which '
            'candidates should be approved. Prescott is currently a senior '
            'executive at Hanover Communications, a company founded by John '
            'Major’s former director of communications which is regularly used '
            'as a recruiting ground for Conservative special advisers. His '
            'appointment was confirmed as ministers relaunched the recruitment '
            'process for a new individual to oversee Ofcom – but only after '
            'tweaking the job description to favour a more confrontational '
            'candidate. Paul Dacre has been Downing Street’s preferred choice '
            'to oversee Ofcom since last summer but unexpectedly flunked his '
            'interview on the first attempt in May. The original panel '
            'believed he did not fulfil the required criteria for the £142,500 '
            'a year, three-day-a-week role running the board of the media '
            'regulator. Rather than accept a different candidate who did pass '
            'the vetting process, ministers instead decided to rerun the '
            'entire recruitment process to give Dacre a second shot. Five '
            'months later, after struggling to find people to help run the '
            'interview process, ministers have finally readvertised the role. '
            'The new job description for Ofcom chair has been amended to '
            'describe a more confrontational candidate. Originally the '
            'successful applicant for the role was required to prove their '
            'commitment to working “collegiately” with fellow board members '
            'and show they could build a “positive relationship” with the '
            'Ofcom chief executive, Melanie Dawes. This time around, the '
            'successful applicant only has to commit to working “effectively” '
            'with fellow board members and show they could have a “productive '
            'relationship” with the chief executive. The requirement for the '
            'Ofcom chair to “support the chief executive” has also been '
            'replaced with the lesser requirement to “challenge” the chief '
            'executive and only give them “appropriate support”. The new job '
            'advert has removed a requirement for the successful candidate to '
            '“be the most senior representative and ambassador of Ofcom”. In '
            'addition, the need for first-hand “familiarity” with the world of '
            'regulation has also been replaced with a requirement for a lesser '
            '“understanding” of regulation. Ministers will have the final say '
            'on who gets to oversee Ofcom, with the final candidate required '
            'to attend a hearing of the House of Commons culture select '
            'committee before the appointment is confirmed. That committee is '
            'led by Julian Knight, who has previously said Dacre should not be '
            'allowed to reapply for the job after failing on the first '
            'attempt. Any member of the public can apply for the position of '
            'Ofcom chair if they think they meet the criteria, although the '
            'last time it was advertised only nine people put their names '
            'forward after it was made clear the government wanted Dacre. '

{'article': 'The big names over the jumps are emerging week by week and '
            'Cheltenham’s November meeting is on the horizon but the '
            'international Flat season has one final flourish to come. The '
            'pulling power of Del Mar on the Pacific coast in California – '
            '“where the surf meets the turf” – has attracted a huge European '
            'team for the 2021 Breeders’ Cup meeting later this week. More '

            'positions takes place later on Monday, but the quarantine barn at '
            'Del Mar is currently home to 40 horses from stables in Europe. '
            'They include Dermot Weld’s Tarnawa, who will attempt to become '
            'only the third dual winner of the Turf, and Audarya from James '
            'Fanshawe’s Newmarket yard, who defends her title in the Filly & '
            'Mare Turf.\n'
            'The Group One winners Love, Glass Slippers, Teona and Mother '
            'Earth are also engaged on the main card on Saturday – which means '
            'that half a dozen fillies and mares are the team leaders this '
            'weekend – while the juvenile events on turf on Friday’s card are '
            'also packed with European challengers. Hello You (Juvenile '
            'Fillies Turf) and Go Bears Go (Juvenile Turf Sprint) are due to '
            'line up in the increasingly familiar purple colours of football '
            'agent Kia Joorabchian, while Dubawi Legend, the runner-up to '
            'Europe’s champion two-year-old Native Trail in the Dewhurst last '
            'time, is among several live contenders for the Juvenile Turf. The '
            'Breeders’ Cup’s claim to be the “world championships” of racing '
            'may still grate with some on the other side of the Atlantic but '
            'it is, by a country mile, as close as we are ever likely to get. '
            'As the most valuable meeting in what is still the world’s biggest '
            'racing industry, its significance is also understood by '
            'international Flat racing’s biggest players. The longstanding, '
            'entirely justified complaints about race-day medication should '
            'also now be a thing of the past, as this will be the first '
            'Breeders’ Cup at which all 14 races are Lasix-free.\n'
            'While one potential source of controversy has been addressed, '
            'another remains in the unmistakable form of the trainer Bob '
            'Baffert. The controversy over Medina Spirit’s failed drug test '
            'after winning the Kentucky Derby in May has slipped down the news '
            'agenda somewhat over the last few months, but the situation is '
            'still unresolved and Medina Spirit himself is a contender for '
            'Saturday’s $7m Classic. The British Horseracing Authority has '
            'often been criticised for the glacial speed of its disciplinary '
            'procedures, but the Medina Spirit case is becoming a “hold my '
            'beer” moment for racing in the US. As yet, nearly six months on '
            'from the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit has not been '
            'disqualified for testing positive for betamethasone, a banned '
            'steroid. Baffert’s struggle to avoid a DQ for Medina Spirit has '
            'disappeared into the rabbit hole of America’s legal system. It is '
            'anyone’s guess when a decision might finally emerge. The trainer '
            'claims that the positive test was down to inadvertent use of an '
            'ointment for a skin complaint, having initially suggested it may '
            'have been contaminated by a stable hand urinating in the horse’s '
            'box.\n'
            'Against this backdrop, the Breeders’ Cup approved Baffert to run '
            'horses at this year’s meeting two weeks ago, while imposing '
            'strict conditions on his runners, including tighter '
            'out-of-competition testing in the run-up to the meeting and '
            'heightened security at this barn. In addition to Medina Spirit, '
            'Baffert’s runners are expected to include Gamine, the defending '
            'champion in the Filly & Mare Sprint and another horse with a '
            'chequered medication record. She was disqualified from third '
            'place in the Kentucky Oaks in September 2020 after testing '
            'positive for betamethasone, which is permitted for use in racing '
            'stables as an anti-inflammatory, but with a recommended '
            'withdrawal period of 14 days before a race to ensure that it has '
            'left the horse’s system. At a meeting which is always thick with '
            'plotlines, this is the one that the Breeders’ Cup could have done '
            'without. But it does at least guarantee the eyes of the racing '
            'world will be firmly focused on Del Mar throughout the meeting as '
            'one of the sport’s biggest events unfolds on the Californian '
            'coastline. Breeders’ Cup draw adds complications Several of the '
            'leading European contenders for the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar in '
            'California this weekend were handed tricky outside draws when the '
            'final fields for the $31m meeting were drawn on Monday. Tarnawa, '
            'the defending champion in the Breeders’ Cup Turf, will start from '
            'stall 13 in a 14-strong field, while Teona, the Prix Vermeille '
            'winner, is on her immediate inside in 12. Tarnawa’s hold-up '
            'running style should give her a fair chance to show her best '
            'form, however, even around Del Mar’s tight turf track, and she '
            'remains a clear favourite at a top price of 7-4, with Teona on '
            'offer at 7-1. Audarya, the defending champion in Saturday’s '
            'Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf, will also start from a wide '
            'stall as she attempts to become the first horse to win the race '
            'in consecutive years. James Fanshawe’s mare is in 12 and edged '
            'out to 5-1 (from 9-2) with Coral as a result. Kevin Ryan’s Glass '
            'Slippers, the defending champion in Saturday’s Turf Sprint, drew '
            'stall one, alongside stable companion Emaraaty Ana (2) and likely '
            'favourite Golden Pal (3). Glass Slippers is 13-2 (from 9-1) with '
            'Coral, while Emaraaty Ana is 5-1 (from 11-2). The main contenders '
            'from British stables in Friday’s Juvenile Turf ended up on '
            'opposite sides of the track, as Dubawi Legend, the runner-up '
            'behind Native Trail in the Dewhurst Stakes last month, drew '
            'widest of all in 14 while Modern Games and Albahr, from Charlie '
            'Appleby’s Newmarket yard, will start from stalls one and two '
            'respectively. Dubawi Legend, the most obvious loser among the big '
            'European team after the draw, was pushed out to 9-2 (from 3-1) '
            'with Paddy Power, while Modern Games is now the new favourite at '
            'a top price of 4-1.',

            'When one reads of property prices rising it is not that bricks '
            'and mortar have increased in value but the land. Why? Because '
            'they stopped making it aeons ago and its supply is limited. Also, '
            'the value of a site is largely dependent on the planning '

{'article': 'Ian Perkes knows better than most the post-Brexit vision that was '
            'sold to the fishing industry by the Vote Leave team and the now '
            'prime minister, Boris Johnson. Looking out over Brixham harbour '
            'from his office, the fish merchant recalls meeting Johnson in '
            'August 2019, less than six months before the UK ended its '
            'membership of the European Union. “He’s telling me we’re going to '
            'have to take on extra staff because we’re going to be so busy,” '
            'Perkes says. “With all this free trade, they’re going to want our '
            'fish.” Asked how he now views the prime minister, he pauses. “I’m '
            'disappointed,” he replies bitterly. “He never mentioned the extra '
            'costs.” To Perkes and others in the Brixham fishing industry, the '
            'current dispute with France over the number of licences issued to '
            'French fishermen to operate in UK waters is the latest in a long '
            'line of issues to hit business after Brexit. “If there wasn’t any '
            'Brexit, there wouldn’t be any issues,” he said. “We were getting '
            'on fine before that.” But Perkes surprises with a key admission – '
            'he voted to leave the EU. “I’ve been trolled since I first '
            'revealed this – but I wish I had voted to stay in. I never '
            'realised we were going to incur all these costs. We were told it '
            'was going to be free trade.” Brexit created mountains of '
            'paperwork for Perkes and his industry peers. He says sales are '
            'down and costs are up, and it’s all down to the departure from '
            'the EU. And the latest fight – with the French threatening to '
            'blockade their ports, is adding to their woes. “It does impact '
            'Brixham,” he said. “They start blockading the port, we’re not '
            'going to be able to send fish.” But despite his regrets, he '
            'believes the way forward is for the UK to “toughen up” its stance '
            'towards France. “They want to bring their wines and cheeses and '
            'delicacies into the UK? Let’s make it tougher for them,” he said. '
            '“Let’s put tariffs on it. Let’s stop Citroen and Renault bringing '
            'cars in. Let’s make it difficult, as difficult as they’re making '
            'it for us. Because it can work both ways.”\n'
            'Morris Reid, a skipper on the Margaret Anne, a scallop boat, said '
            'a blockade at the French ports could potentially see them lose up '
            'to £20,000 every few days. But he believes if Brexit had not '
            'happened, the industry would still be facing one dispute or '
            'another. “It’s ridiculous. The French, if you look at the charter '
            'and how the quota is broken down … have got about 90% of the '
            'quota … it just seems they want more and more and more,” he says. '
            '“It’s all for the votes. There’s an election in France after '
            'Christmas. Macron is just trying to get the votes. It’s '
            'ridiculous. “We’ve been looking into it. If they blockade the '
            'ports, we’ll put more stuff through Holland.” “Boris Johnson '
            'needs to grow a backbone and just say enough’s enough. We should '
            'start blocking the harbours, see how they like it. It’s '
            'ridiculous. There’s a very tight timeline. If scallops are held '
            'up 24 hours, they will spoil.”\n'
            'Lowic Farnham, 31, the skipper of the fishing boat Sanderling, '
            'has relocated from Jersey to Brixham because of the wider '
            'implications of Brexit. “Since Brexit, we’ve been shafted,” he '
            'said. Previously, Jersey fishers could head straight into French '
            'ports, but since Brexit they are required to return to Jersey, '
            'narrowing the window in which they can fish. He now finds himself '
            'living on his small boat, and his wife and children are back in '
            'Jersey. He doesn’t expect to see them again until Christmas. “I '
            'can see over here how they feel [about EU membership], but in '
            'Jersey it should never have affected us,” he said. “We didn’t '
            'even get to vote. We’ve been sucked up into it. I wish things had '
            'stayed as they were. I need to support my family. If I don’t '
            'fish, I don’t get any money. Brexit put so many more '
            'restrictions. Too many variables.”\n'
            'Others are more optimistic. Mending nets on the harbourside on a '
            'sunny Monday morning, Wesley Lowland says it is true that costs '
            'have risen, but so has the price of fish. “Shellfish [trade] is '
            'suffering, but I’m not worried. The fish [trade] has been pretty '
            'good.”',

            'investigators) with a trove of emails that Staley’s former '
            'employer, the US bank JP Morgan, has handed to the authorities. '
            '“Obviously I thought I knew him well, and I didn’t. For sure, '
            'with hindsight, with what we know now, I deeply regret having any '
            'relationship with Jeffrey,” Staley said last year, adding that he '
            'had been “very transparent” with investigators, who he said were '
            'focusing on his “transparency and openness with the bank”. Staley '
            'had known Epstein since at least 2000, when he was the boss of JP '
            'Morgan’s private bank and Epstein was one of his most valued '
            'ultra-wealthy clients. He has said his relationship with Epstein '
            'started to “taper off” when he left JP Morgan in 2013. However, '
            'in April 2015, Staley and his wife, Deby, sailed to Epstein’s '
            'private island, Little St James, in the US Virgin Islands, on '
            'their 91ft wenge wood yacht Bequia. Staley describes Bequia, '
            'which is named after the Caribbean island on which the couple '
            'spent their honeymoon, as “not a big yacht, but it is a big '
            'boat”. While the yacht was designed primarily for relaxed '
            'cruising, Staley sailed it across the Atlantic to complete one of '
            'his “bucket list” life goals, and won the Loro Piana Superyacht '
            'regatta in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, in 2013. Staley was born in '
            'Boston, and remains an avid Red Sox fan, but moved cities '
            'frequently during his childhood because of his father’s job at PQ '
            'Corporation, a chemicals company. Barclays has agreed to pay for '
            'relocation costs if he moves back to the US, where he owns an '
            'apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan and a house in Southampton, '
            'the Long Island playground of the Wall Street elite. Friends have '
            'described Staley as not your typical brash, boastful investment '
            'banker, but a sensitive, reflective and respectful soul who '
            'concentrates on building strong teams around him rather than '
            'bullying subordinates. Staley, who was christened James but has '
            'been known since childhood as Jes, joined a forerunner of JP '
            'Morgan straight after graduating from Bowdoin College, Maine, '
            'with a degree in economics in 1979. He had been widely tipped as '
            'frontrunner to succeed Jamie Dimon as CEO of JP Morgan, but is '
            'said to have grown bored with waiting for Dimon, who has been CEO '
            'since 2005, to leave. He left JP Morgan in 2013 to join the New '
            'York hedge fund BlueMountain Capital as managing partner and '
            'joined Barclays in 2015.',

{'article': 'Formula One will hold six sprint race meetings next season, the '
            'sporting director, Ross Brawn, has confirmed. The concept is '
            'being tested this year with three sprint races and Brawn said '
            'that while the format has been heralded as a success, F1 is '
            'almost certain to revert to awarding pole position for the grand '
            'prix from qualifying times rather than being decided by the '
            'sprint race on a Saturday.\n'
            'F1 has held two sprint race weekends this season, at Silverstone '
            'and Monza, with a third scheduled for Brazil in two weeks. The '
            'format features qualifying for the sprint on a Friday with the '
            'results of that race deciding the grid for the GP, with three, '
            'two and one drivers’ championship points awarded to the top '
            'three. While discussions with the teams and the FIA continue, '
            'Brawn is confident one of the biggest criticisms of the format '
            'will be addressed, that of setting the fastest lap in qualifying '
            'being rewarded with pole position. “It’s been a consistent '
            'comment amongst fans and drivers that the person who does the '
            'fastest single lap with low fuel in qualifying is the pole '
            'position holder,” he said. “I guess we hadn’t really considered '
            'that when we set out this new format. I would like to see a '
            'reversion to that being pole position. There is broad opinion '
            'that Friday should be pole position for the sprint weekends, so I '
            'would hope we can get that through for next year. I am optimistic '
            'on that.” The venues for the sprint meeting are still under '
            'discussion but they will not feature in the opening or final '
            'rounds of the 23-race season. With the sprint qualifying races '
            'this season pedestrian at best, dialogue continues as to how the '
            'format could be further tweaked for 2022, but Brawn emphasised '
            'that given F1 will be using new cars next year any changes would '
            'be “conservative and evolutionary”. He confirmed that awarding '
            'more points further down the grid, potentially one-third of race '
            'points for the top 10, was one proposal in order to offer more '
            'incentive for drivers to challenge in the sprint.\n'
            '“It goes far enough down for people in lower positions to want to '
            'fight for it, but is not a number that will over-influence the '
            'championship,” he said. Brawn believes reverse grids for the '
            'sprint are off the table for 2022 while the sport discusses the '
            'exact form it should take. Having it as an entirely standalone '
            'race remains an option, as does having its grid set by Friday’s '
            'qualifying. The details will be addressed in a meeting with the '
            'teams after Brazil but Brawn said the format could be adopted '
            'across the full season in future if it proves to be a success.',

            'moments always follow you home, Remiro’s look meanwhile revealed '
            'this one will follow him further than that. The first league goal '
            'Real had conceded at home this season could hardly have come at a '
            'worse time.\n'
            'The board was just going up on a Basque derby that was the way '
            'it’s supposed to be at last, the first played before fans for 630 '
            'days, when it happened. Real Sociedad were 1-0 up, Alexander Isak '
            'having scored from the spot early in the second half, and '
            'Athletic were down to 10 men. Better still for the home '
            'supporters, it was Iñigo Martínez, the man who had walked out on '
            'them and crossed the divide, who had given away the penalty – the '
            'sixth he has conceded at Athletic, three of them against his '
            'former club – and who had been sent off. When the card was shown, '
            'Remiro had leapt into the air celebrating. Now the fans were '
            'doing the same. Backs turned to the pitch, arms locked together, '
            'they bounced. How they had missed this. “This is the game I look '
            'forward to winning more than any other and that’s true of '
            'everyone who feels Real Sociedad,” the coach Imanol Alguacil had '
            'said the day before as the rain poured at Zubieta, and this time '
            'especially. There have been three meetings over the last e18 '
            'months, sure, but it wasn’t the same, not even when one was the '
            'most historic Copa del Rey final there has been. That much was '
            'shown by Athletic and Real insisting on postponing the final. '
            'Few, if any clubs would have held on so long to get their people '
            'in, aware that that’s the whole point. Now here they were again, '
            'miles better late than never. Sunday started with the bertso '
            'derbi, the Basque street poetry sing-off won by Athletic or la '
            'Real depending on which paper you read, and ended with 21 players '
            'on the pitch of which 18 had been through the youth systems at '
            'one of these two clubs. Fans drank together and sat together. '
            'Tickets were sold out, the Reale Arena packing in 37,066 – its '
            'highest attendance ever. And they belted out the club’s anthem, '
            'holding aloft a tifo in blue and white and the colours of the '
            'Ikurriña, the Basque flag. Then they played, the noise never '
            'falling. It had been frantic, fast, and if there was not a huge '
            'amount of football, it had been quite fun too, the tension and '
            'ferocity making up for what it lacked in finesses. Athletic had '
            'more shots, 11 to eight, and more corners, eight to two. Remiro '
            'had made three sharp saves. And Aritz Elustondo had produced two '
            'superb interceptions to deny Williams, the first after just '
            'sixty-two seconds. But the threat hadn’t been overwhelming at all '
            '– in fact it had only occasionally been apparent – and now it '
            'appeared to have passed. Martin Zubimendi was in control, the '
            'defence had been reinforced and Real Sociedad, the Copa del Rey '
            'winners, were on the verge of defeating their rivals again and '
            'climbing three points clear, confirmation perhaps of their '
            'candidacy for the title. Only once had they reached week 11 on '
            'more points and now they were about to add three more, racking up '
            'an eighth clean sheet in 12 league games.\n'
            'Bad Moon Rising was belting round the ground, scarves twirling. '
            'Tell me how it feels, the opening line runs. But then Athletic '
            'got a free kick on the top left corner of the area, Julen Lobete '
            'fouling Muniain as he cut inside. Muniain placed the ball. “It '
            'was wet. I wanted to hit hard and on target, thinking that '
            'someone might deflect it,” he said, “Remiro tried to clear it but '
            'those kinds of balls are difficult.” His shot bent towards the '
            'near post and the Real Sociedad goalkeeper dived forwards, fists '
            'out like Superman. Rather than punching clear, though, he '
            'misjudged the flight – his and the ball’s – and it went off his '
            'knuckles and into the top of the net. It was the 91st minute and '
            '1-1. In the top corner of the ground, 543 Athletic fans went '
            'wild. All around it, maybe a hundred more did the same, figures '
            'in red and white leaping from within the sea of blue and white. '
            'Muniain sprinted towards the bench, which was sprinting towards '
            'him, and leapt into the arms of Marcelino García Toral. His '
            'players had resisted again – they have only been beaten once this '
            'season – and Athletic’s manager wore a massive smile. They had '
            'deserved this, he said afterwards. “The draw stings but I’m '
            'proud,” his opposite number Imanol Alguacil insisted. No one was '
            'more stung than Remiro. In midweek, Australian keeper Matty Ryan '
            'had produced an astonishing performance at Celta in only his '
            'second league appearance of the season. Remiro had immediately '
            'returned to the side but now this had happened and against them, '
            'a derby decided by two men who crossed sides. On Sunday evening, '
            'Iñigo Martínez, an ex-Real Sociedad player had been sent off and '
            'given away the penalty that seemed to have gifted his former club '
            'the victory, fans laughing as he left. And Remiro, an ex-Athletic '
            'player, had gifted his former club the equaliser. Not that the '
            'cases are quite the same. Born in Navarre, raised at Lezama, '
            'Remiro never actually played a first team game with Athletic. One '
            'Friday afternoon after training in 2018, he was called into a '
            'room with the then Athletic president Josu Urrutia and the former '
            'sporting director José Mari Amorrutu and told that if he didn’t '
            'sign a new contract he wouldn’t play. Kepa was leaving, an '
            'opportunity opening up, but Remiro had been sent out on loan '
            'twice and wasn’t convinced the chance was real. The pressure '
            'helped him make up his mind: rather than bowing to it, he decided '
            'to depart, even if it meant a season not playing. With Iago '
            'Herrerín getting injured, Unai Simón, the fourth-choice keeper '
            'who would soon become first for club and country, was hurriedly '
            'recalled from his loan at Elche where he had only been for 20 '
            'days and Athletic followed through on the threat: Remiro was left '
            'out.\n'
            'A year later, he joined Real Sociedad. When he won the Copa del '
            'Rey with them, defeating Athletic in the final, he posted a video '
            'that emulated Williams’ “I’m so tired” celebration from the Super '
            'Cup three months earlier. It didn’t seem a particularly big deal, '
            'but it was soon turned into one. Remiro insisted that he just '
            'thought it a funny line, that he was not mocking Williams and '
            'apologised to Athletic’s players when they faced each other in '
            'the league immediately after. “Some said it was out of order, '
            'others that they didn’t care, and others not to worry about it, '
            'but I felt ashamed,” he later admitted. “I didn’t like seeing the '
            'video out there but I learnt from it: not to be a dickhead next '
            'time there’s a moment of euphoria.”\n'
            'The next time they met was anything but euphoric. Remiro looked '
            'devastated, eyes gone. Teammates came to him – Diego Rico '
            'literally lifted his chin up – but it was like he was lost. “He’s '
            'gutted because of the way the goal happened. His error is the '
            'most visible but it was a series of errors,” Zubimendi said. “He '
            'kept us alive until the end: he made great saves,” Alguacil '
            'insisted, “football is that: getting it right and getting it '
            'wrong. Today he got it right lots of times and got it wrong just '
            'once. He’s a professional and no doubt that tomorrow he will be '
            'up for the next game again.” Even former Real Sociedad goalkeeper '
            'Sander Westerveld, there the last time they started a season this '
            'well, leading the league early, not losing until February – '
            'against Athletic, inevitably – and chasing all the way to the '
            'line, offered support. None of which is especially unusual but '
            'they weren’t the first to Remiro, the symbol of a rivalry that’s '
            'still different to the rest. Instead, it was Iñaki Williams and '
            'Iker Muniain, the Athletic captain who had stood and applauded la '
            'Real as they lifted the trophy at the end of the cup final they '
            'had waited for their whole lives, and whose shot flew past Remiro '
            'on the night when the fans finally returned to make the derby the '
            'kind of day it’s supposed to be.',

{'article': 'My memory of my mother’s sewing basket stretches as far back as I '
            'can recall. Even now, if I went looking for it I’m sure the '
            'fabric scraps, loose buttons, thimbles, pink pin cushion and '
            'spools of coloured thread would be exactly as I remember them. It '
            'seemed like something every grown-up house would have: the '
            'relevant tools to sew on lost buttons or stitch together ballet '
            'costumes. But as an adult, I’ve never owned a sewing kit. I '
            'outsource all my clothing repairs to my dry cleaner or tailor. '
            'Speaking to Nicole Mallalieu, a fashion lecturer at the '
            'Australian College of the Arts, about easy home repairs made me '
            'realise I’ve been missing out on one of life’s simple pleasures. '
            'The satisfaction and meditation of mending something for '
            'yourself.\n'
            'How to sew on a button Before you sew on a button, Mallalieu says '
            'to “take the time to examine the other buttons on the garment” so '
            'you can see what stitching pattern to use, and where to place it. '
            'She says to start by threading a needle with thread, doubling the '
            'thread over and knotting it at the bottom. Then, hold the button '
            'in place and starting from behind the fabric, poke the needle '
            'through the fabric and one hole of the button and pull it until '
            'the knot hits the back of the fabric. Then feed the needle back '
            'through the other hole, and push it through to the other side of '
            'the fabric. “You keep doing that until the button feels quite '
            'secure,” she says. If the button has four holes you can stitch in '
            'straight lines, or make a cross – just follow the same pattern as '
            'the garment’s other buttons. To finish, poke the needle through '
            'one hole to the back of the fabric and make a knot by wrapping '
            'the thread around the needle two or three times before pulling it '
            'through, and cutting the tail off. This is called a French knot. '
            'If you want more guidance, Mallalieu suggests looking at online '
            'tutorials like this one. How to darn a sock “The act of darning '
            'brings you into a meditative state,” says Mallalieu, “you’re '
            'fixing the sock instead of fixing life, but kind of fixing life '
            'as well.” To darn a sock, she says you need a darning mushroom '
            'which is a piece of wood shaped like, well, a mushroom.\n'
            'You place it inside the sock, so the hole is spread over the '
            'curve of the mushroom. She suggests getting yarn to match or '
            'compliment the colour of your sock. Starting from one corner, she '
            'says to “stitch with the yarn and a needle to cover the hole in '
            'the sock with what looks like bars in a jail”. Once you have '
            'captured all of the fabric with vertical lines, work the needle '
            'back through the stitches horizontally, “one under, one over, one '
            'under, one over as if you’re weaving fabric”. She tells me there '
            'are lots of videos online that provide clear instructions for how '
            'to do this. How to sew a patch over a hole If you don’t have a '
            'lot of skills, Mallaelieu thinks patching can be a very fun way '
            'to cover holes or stains or embellish clothes. She says to '
            'embrace the visible mending trend so “it doesn’t matter if you’re '
            'not very good at stitching”. She suggests using a “colourful yarn '
            'or thread” and doing a “running stitch by going in and out with a '
            'needle” around the edge or across the fabric which “you might '
            'need to pin in place”. Repairing fallen hems\n'
            'The easiest way to repair a fallen hem is to use hemming tape, '
            'that you put inside the hem and press with an iron, but this is a '
            'stopgap that will only hold until the next wash. Alternatively, '
            'you can stitch by hand using a needle with a single thread, '
            'knotted at the end. Mallalieu says to press the hem first and '
            'then stitch between the two edges of the fabric, “your aim is to '
            'have it not show on the outside”. She suggests watching an online '
            'tutorial that demonstrates different techniques like herringbone '
            'or whip stitches. If you’re handy with a sewing machine and the '
            'hem was machine stitched, she says, “you’ll need to get back onto '
            'a sewing machine, press the hem into shape and copy what’s been '
            'sewn.” According to Mallalieu adjusting the length of a hem is a '
            'two-person job, because you need “somebody else to measure it up '
            'from the floor and pin it on you” to be sure it’s even. She '
            'advises pressing the hem and then putting the garment back on to '
            'be sure it’s sitting where you want it, before cutting and sewing '
            'it into place. How to safely turn your jeans into shorts To cut '
            'your jeans into even shorts, Mallalieu says you need to lie them '
            'down flat and match the inseam from the crotch to the ankle, then '
            'fold them in half so the legs are one on top of the other.\n'
            'Using a big pair of scissors, cut through both legs at the same '
            'time. Keep in mind that denim will fray a centimetre or two after '
            'it’s been cut, so you need to leave a bit of extra length. How to '
            'change the length of a sleeve\n'
            'Mallalieu says sleeve alterations really depend on the item’s '
            'fabric and the finish you want. If you just want to cut the '
            'sleeve off and leave a raw edge, you need to be aware of the '
            'fabric’s weave. “The tighter the weave, the less likely it is to '
            'fall apart, finer fabrics with looser weaves are more likely to '
            'fray.” To prevent fraying she recommends “running a small zig zag '
            'stitch around the edge”. Alternatively, she says you can cut the '
            'sleeves off a T-shirt, or anything that’s cotton jersey without '
            'worrying because “it won’t fray, it’ll just roll up”. She says if '
            '“you’re turning a shirt into a short sleeve shirt, cut it to the '
            'length you want plus three centimetres, so you can fold it over '
            'one centimetre, and then two centimetres,” and hem it by running '
            'a sewing machine around the edge, or if you’re doing it by hand, '
            'use a herringbone stitch. Mallalieu offers some final advice, '
            'applicable to any home-mending job: “Know that it’s not that hard '
            'and give it a crack. The most important thing is knowing that you '
            'can do it, especially if you put in a little bit of time.”',

{'article': 'A first kiss is an essential part of any coming-of-age narrative. '
            'It certainly was for Shane Jenek, the Brisbane-born performer '
            'best known as his drag alias, Courtney Act. About 60 pages into '
            'Jenek’s new memoir, Caught in the Act, he experiences his first '
            'kiss with someone of the same gender. It arrives with appropriate '
            'fanfare: “an entire lifetime of denied sexuality was unleashed in '
            'a single moment,” he writes. “Something innate and intrinsic that '
            'had lain just below the surface for the past 18 years was being '
            'acknowledged for the first time.” It was huge for Jenek – it just '
            'took him a couple of decades to realise that. “At the time, it '
            'was just exciting – and then when I was writing it, 21 years '
            'later, I was so overwhelmed with emotion, because I realised that '
            'I could never understand, at [the time of] that kiss, what it all '
            'meant, and what the 18 years leading up to that meant,” he says.\n'
            'Now 39, Jenek has settled into a rare kind of mainstream ubiquity '
            'for a drag performer; in Australia, he’s something of a household '
            'name, thanks to time on the first season of Australian Idol, an '
            'Australian Story episode about his life, and a stint hosting One '
            'Plus One. Despite his fame, writing Caught in the Act made Jenek '
            'realise there was a lot of his past he had never dealt with. “To '
            'reflect back on it … I just sat there sobbing, for that teenage '
            'boy who retrospectively struggled so much. I didn’t even know it '
            'was a struggle at the time, because it was just life happening.” '
            'Caught in the Act is filled with poignant moments like these, '
            'pieces of a complex puzzle that Jenek – who uses he/him pronouns '
            'out of drag, as he was during our interview, and she/her pronouns '
            'in drag – has only been able to properly assemble recently.\n'
            'Beginning with Jenek’s upbringing in Brisbane, the book sketches '
            'his most significant milestones: his first time in drag; '
            'competing on Idol; time spent working in clubs along Oxford '
            'Street, Sydney’s “gay Golden Mile”; an eventual move to the US, '
            'and an appearance on the sixth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race. In '
            'its final pages, he details his winning stint on the UK’s '
            'Celebrity Big Brother.\n'
            'Despite Jenek being a first-time memoirist, Caught in the Act is '
            'eminently readable, balancing emotional and political epiphanies '
            'with saucy, sordid party scenes and an appealing, '
            'rough-and-tumble sense of style. At its best, Caught in the Act '
            'serves as a kind of personal history of Oxford Street at the turn '
            'of the millennium, with Jenek recalling, in minute detail, the '
            'many codes and subcultures of the Sydney queer scene: the correct '
            'and incorrect ways to dress and wear makeup; the petty beefs that '
            'were fostered and abandoned; the many club nights that opened and '
            'closed but have rarely been historicised in the mainstream. The '
            'ability to look back at this period, the beginnings of Jenek’s '
            'drag career, brought on more realisations.\n'
            'These were related to his “prism of understanding at the time”, '
            'and how it filtered his memories. “I can see that that exact same '
            'situation might have been a hellhole for someone else, and so '
            'that was really interesting,” he says. “I can totally see how '
            'that experience was very narrow and limited to white, gay men. '
            'And even my deviations from that – being feminine, or maybe '
            'having attractions that were not strictly homosexual – were sort '
            'of just ironed out.” But on stage, it was a different story. “One '
            'thing that I did love about the drag scene was that it was – '
            'well, it wasn’t diverse in that there were no cis women,” he '
            'corrects himself, “but as far as ages and races and genders, '
            'other than cis women, it was really diverse.” While the punters '
            'were mostly white and male, backstage Jenek “just loved sitting '
            'in a dressing room with a 60-year-old queen and an 18-year-old '
            'queen” listening to “so much oral history – stories about Sydney '
            'in the 80s, during the Aids crisis, hearing stories about Sydney '
            'drag icons. I remember feeling so moved by that as a young '
            'person.”\n'
            'Jenek realised “that there was no access to that if it wasn’t for '
            'the oral history that was happening in dressing rooms and sewing '
            'bees”. Chronicling those stories felt like an act of respect to '
            'the people who shaped the scene, “a very small thank you to those '
            'people and that time”. In the book, Jenek alludes to the fact '
            'that gay bars like those he frequented in the 2000s – as a '
            'performer and patron – are dwindling in number. (There were about '
            '1,400 gay bars worldwide in 2019, as compared with more than '
            '2,500 in the US alone in 1976.) Jenek suggests it’s a loss for '
            'queer subcultures but, perhaps, a marker of gradual societal '
            'acceptance of LGBT+ people. Oxford Street was a draw for Jenek '
            '“because I didn’t feel that I could be queer in the world that I '
            'existed in – you certainly couldn’t wander down the street '
            'holding someone’s hand”. Now, “obviously the culture has '
            'changed”. Jenek points to the rise of dating apps, which have '
            'siphoned off bar patronage, making businesses less viable. This '
            'is “both a blessing and a curse”. “It’s wonderful that people '
            'don’t feel the need for these exclusive queer spaces as much, but '
            'there is a real magic in them.” Caught in the Act often grapples '
            'with this tension – between the mainstreaming and protection of '
            'queer culture, the popularity of TV shows like Drag Race and the '
            'economic impacts, both good and bad, they have on local scenes. '
            'Ultimately, Jenek sees the urgent need for more diversity – for '
            'easy access to different stories. He acknowledges that his '
            'childhood and adolescent years may not have been so suffused with '
            'shame had he been able to see queerness reflected in mainstream '
            'spaces.\n'
            '“When people get to hear [a] diversity of stories – whether '
            'that’s gender, sexuality, race, age, disability – all of those '
            'different stories that for so long haven’t been told, when those '
            'stories get told in the mainstream, they change the world for the '
            'better,” he says. Particularly for young people, mainstream '
            'culture is “inescapable”. “As queer people, we might find a point '
            'where we deviate away from the mainstream, but ultimately we’re, '
            'for the most part, born and exist inside the mainstream until … '
            'we’re able to break out of it. “To be able to change what the '
            'mainstream [is] to something … more inclusive to more people '
            'means that less people will have to find a way out of it. More '
            'people will be able to find value in themselves and in the world '
            'that they just already exist in – I think that’s a wonderful '
            'future.” To Jenek, this isn’t about assimilation but acceptance. '
            '“I don’t think the goal is for everyone to be straight, and the '
            'goal is not for everyone to be mainstream – the goal is for '
            'everyone to be themselves.”',

{'article': 'Most people know well the tedium and joy of moving into some '
            'small space and making it their own. Meticulously putting things '
            'away might not immediately seem like award-winning video game '
            'material – but Tim Dawson is hoping it will prove popular. “The '
            'whole thing is already sort of game-like,” says Dawson, one of '
            'the co-founders of Witch Beam, the Australian developers behind '
            'new indie game Unpacking. “You’ve got the delight and surprise of '
            'pulling stuff out of boxes and not knowing what will come next … '
            'and you’ve got this clear end goal where everything is finally '
            'organised.” Now available for PC, Switch and Xbox One, Unpacking '
            'won game of the year at this year’s Australian Game Developers’ '
            'Awards – the same title won in 2019 by the riotously successful '
            'Untitled Goose Game. In line with recent trends towards '
            '“wholesome” gaming, Unpacking is a self-described zen puzzler – a '
            'kind of Marie Kondo-esque balm for the chaotic world we live in.\n'
            'The game’s narrative is laid-back: a quiet and charming tale of a '
            'life over time, told mostly through the items brought between '
            'moves as the unseen main character grows up. Soft toys, books, a '
            'battered and chipped mug; familiar items reappear out of '
            'cardboard boxes as the years progress and the locations change '
            'from a childhood room, to a small uni flat, to a crowded suburban '
            'sharehouse and beyond. Dawson and his fellow Witch Beam '
            'co-founders, Sanatana “Nat” Mishra and composer Jeff van Dyck, '
            'split from established studios to go indie, with their first '
            'project the hyperkinetic (and critically well-received) arcade '
            'shooter Android Assault Cactus in 2015. While looking for a new '
            'project to work on, Dawson moved in with his partner, Wren Brier '
            '– an artist who had previously worked on games like Jetpack '
            'Joyride and Fruit Ninja – and an idea clicked.\n'
            '“I helped him with packing up his stuff, and we realised: every '
            'item is like a little adventure,” says Brier, who is the creative '
            'lead on the game. “This one came from Tokyo Disney; this one’s '
            'from when you went skiing … and unpacking it all, it’s both '
            'discovery and self-expression at the same time.” “You can tell a '
            'lot about a person from the items they own,” adds Dawson. “That '
            'was really exciting to me from a narrative storytelling point of '
            'view, to tell a story without cutscenes or lectures.”\n'
            'The game is, at heart, pretty simple: you click on items and '
            'place them wherever you want in a room, until you’re completely '
            'unpacked. But since it’s a puzzle game, there’s limits to where '
            'you can acceptably leave things – with wrong choices marked with '
            'an angry, pulsating outline. Kitchen knives, for instance, can’t '
            'simply be packed away on the floor, or books left strewn across a '
            'bed. “You should be able to put things where you want, within '
            'reason,” says Dawson, “but every now and then, we’re a bit more '
            'specific about something,” – like a secret diary, or a meaningful '
            'photograph – “and those points usually serve as the sort of '
            'emotional beats of the game.”\n'
            'Set to the extremely chilled-out backdrop of guitars and synths, '
            'a very personal form of order gradually emerges from the chaotic '
            'piles of boxes and knick-knacks. Much of the game’s charm lies in '
            'its capacity for self-expression, something the team discovered '
            'in prototyping. “I remember one friend, she took out this juicer, '
            'and she was like ‘I never use these’, and she shoved it as far '
            'back as she could behind a bunch of other items,” laughs Brier. '
            '“It turns out that people love to watch other people play '
            'Unpacking because it’s something that everyone knows how to do. '
            '“So it’s really easy to backseat drive, and you learn a lot about '
            'someone when you watch them unpack.” It also led to the discovery '
            'of some unexpected cultural differences. “Quite a few '
            'Asian-American players asked us if they could store stuff in the '
            'oven,” says Brier. “And I think it was a Latvian player, she '
            'didn’t know what the dish rack was. They have a kind of built-in '
            'dish rack cupboard above the sink, so they don’t need a separate '
            'rack.”\n'
            'Building the game, they were conscious of representation across '
            'cultures (“We had a strong reaction to the dreidel,” Brier says), '
            'genders (“the tampons and stuff … dudes are kind of bewildered, '
            'but women are like, ‘I’ve never seen that in a game before!’”), '
            'and even geography. The game is set in Brisbane – which most '
            'people won’t pick up on. “The first level, the kid’s room, it’s '
            'set in a Queenslander,” Dawson says. “Some people will recognise '
            'the boards on the walls, they might recognise the gum trees '
            'outside … There’s something cool about a well-realised world.” '
            'Witch Beam joins a wave of small Australian teams punching above '
            'their weight on the international stage, alongside breakout '
            'studios like Team Cherry (Hollow Knight) and House House '
            '(Untitled Goose Game), as well as more modest entrants including '
            'Beethovan and Dinosaur (The Artful Escape) and Modern '
            'Storytellers (The Forgotten City). And with Unpacking they’re '
            'hoping for an international market, for a game that deals with a '
            'universally meditative experience. “I thought we were making a '
            'niche game that would just appeal to people who liked organising '
            'stuff,” Dawson says, “but it actually seems to have a broader '
            'appeal.”',

{'article': 'In all the revelations to tumble out of the NSW Independent '
            'Commission Against Corruption in the last two days of hearings, '
            'one barely raised an eyebrow. With unnerving nonchalance, Gladys '
            'Berejiklian spoke plainly of directing tens of millions of '
            'dollars to Wagga Wagga for political gain. Of course she had '
            'supported grants going to the Riverina Conservatorium of Music '
            'and the Australian Clay Target Association, the former NSW '
            'premier explained, even against departmental advice. There were '
            'seats to be won. Voters to claw back. “I don’t think it would be '
            'a surprise to anybody that we throw money at seats to keep them,” '
            'she said. The evidence barely raised a ripple.\n'
            'Indeed, it appeared to be used by Berejiklian as a kind of '
            'protective shield from the commission’s attempts to establish '
            'whether she gave Daryl Maguire, her then secret boyfriend, '
            'favourable treatment on projects he had been pushing for in his '
            'electorate. The money was not doled out to favour Maguire, '
            'Berejiklian told the commission. Not at all. It favoured a region '
            'where the Liberal party’s fortunes had suffered dramatically as a '
            'byelection loomed. “At the end of the day, whether we like it or '
            'not, that’s democracy,” she said. Have we grown so conditioned to '
            'such brazen political conduct – albeit entirely legal – that it '
            'is now accepted as a form of defence? And what does our '
            'collective shrug of the shoulders tell politicians, current and '
            'future, about the risk-to-benefit ratio of shovelling public '
            'funds to marginal seats? Her former deputy premier, John '
            'Barilaro, has the answer. Earlier this year, he told a '
            'parliamentary inquiry into the administration of bushfire '
            'recovery grants pork barrelling was equivalent to “investment”. '
            '“When you think about it, every single election that every party '
            'goes to, we make commitments,” he said. “You want to call that '
            'pork barrelling, you want to call that buying votes, it’s what '
            'the elections are for.” Berejiklian said the process was '
            '“unfortunately not unique or uncommon” after it was revealed last '
            'year that $140m in grants given to councils prior to the previous '
            'NSW election had gone overwhelmingly to Coalition-held seats. But '
            'her Icac evidence reveals, in stark terms, where politicians draw '
            'the new line in the sand. Integrity experts warn this new '
            'apparent norm of pork barrelling, condoned by the ex-premier, '
            'should not be allowed to settle. Using public funds to benefit '
            'whichever party happens to be in power is not part and parcel of '
            '“democracy”. It is an abuse of government. It entrenches power to '
            'the incumbent. It tips the electoral scales against parties of '
            'opposition. It may not be a criminal offence, but it must be '
            'rooted out for liberal democracy to thrive. Geoffrey Watson, SC, '
            'a former counsel assisting to Icac, said as much last week, after '
            'Berejiklian’s first day of evidence. “Let’s drop this expression '
            'pork barrelling, let’s call it what it really is: misuse of '
            'public money,” he told the ABC. “It’s just wrong. I just don’t '
            'understand why we excuse this conduct. The whole idea of '
            '‘pork-barrelling, it’s OK because everyone does it’, that would '
            'soon lead to the most appalling conduct. You just slide to the '
            'lowest denominator.” In NSW, at least, there are bodies like the '
            'Independent Commission Against Corruption to shine a light on '
            'such practices. That is sadly lacking at a federal level. Not so '
            'Berejiklian’s worldview of pork barrelling as the norm. That is '
            'very much shared by her commonwealth counterparts.\n'
            'Sports rorts brought that into sharp relief, more than any other '
            'scandal in recent memory. The government was condemned for '
            'directing the vast majority of the $100m Community Sports '
            'Infrastructure grants program into marginal or targeted '
            'electorates, usually against the advice of Sport Australia. But '
            'there have been plenty more examples since. Earlier this year, it '
            'was revealed the commonwealth had awarded $389m for commuter car '
            'parks one day before Scott Morrison called the 2019 federal '
            'election. Before that, we heard that a grant scheme for security '
            'cameras, known as the Safer Communities Fund, was used to '
            'distribute $8.5m to 53 projects before the last election, only '
            'five of which were in safe Labor seats. In too many instances, '
            'the money is doled out in ways that contradicts departmental '
            'advice. But when Berejiklian was faced with this proposition, she '
            'dismissed bureaucrats as lacking the requisite political nous for '
            'such decision-making. Departments, she said, were not expert at '
            '“winning byelections”. Indeed they are not. That’s why their '
            'advice is so important.',

{'article': 'Organisers of the Melbourne Cup have been working to clean up its '
            'image after the high profile deaths of seven horses in the past '
            'six years. The changes – aimed at making sure horses are fit to '
            'race and do not have undetected underlying conditions – have been '
            'rolled out alongside an advertising and social media campaign '
            'that focuses on horse welfare. But will it be enough? What is '
            'being done to prevent horse deaths in the race? In 2020, after '
            'pre-race favourite Anthony van Dyck broke down during the cup and '
            'was later euthanised, Racing Victoria commissioned a review into '
            'the injuries and deaths of international horses during the '
            'Melbourne spring racing carnival during the past decade.\n'
            'The review made 44 recommendations, 41 of which were adopted. The '
            'most significant – and from a racing industry perspective '
            'controversial – was the requirement that all Cup runners, local '
            'and international, undergo a diagnostic CT scan of all four limbs '
            'prior to being allowed to race. Racing Victoria will cover the '
            'cost of the scans. The number of international horses permitted '
            'to enter Victoria for the spring carnival has been capped at 24 '
            'and all international arrivals must be scanned prior to travel, '
            'at the cost of owners and trainers, as well as on arrival at the '
            'Werribee quarantine facility. Scans and veterinary checks must be '
            'conducted or have oversight by Racing Victoria veterinarians. '
            'Limits were also placed on the number of races horses could run '
            'once in Australia. The reason for this rule change is that a post '
            'mortem exam of Anthony van Dyck, who suffered catastrophic '
            'fractures to his left front fetlock, showed the five-year-old '
            'Irish stallion had signs of pre-existing stress fractures or '
            'other pre-existing conditions. A scan may have picked up the '
            'weakness and prompted the racetrack vets to order his scratching. '
            'Will this make a difference? It certainly would have made a '
            'difference for Anthony van Dyck. Scanning or X-raying before '
            'international competition has become standard in other parts of '
            'the equestrian world and most top horses have a full set of scans '
            'done annually as a precaution. The main reason not to scan, other '
            'than cost, is worry that you would discover something that would '
            'prevent the horse from competing. Sign up to receive an email '
            'with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'But it’s not a failsafe: horses can have catastrophic injuries '
            'without any pre-existing conditions. Concern remains that the '
            'harder ground at Flemington may increase the risk for '
            'international horses that are used to running in softer '
            'conditions. One of the three recommendations that Racing Victoria '
            'did not accept following Anthony van Dyck’s death was that the '
            'minimum targeted track rating for the Melbourne Cup be changed to '
            '“Good 4” from “Good 3”, on a scale where one is a dry hard track '
            'and 10 is very wet. Racing Victoria said it did not accept that '
            'recommendation in part because it said that track guidelines must '
            'be applied consistently to all races for the integrity of the '
            'sport. Will the whip be banned? In short, not yet. Last year, '
            'Racing Victoria took a proposal to phase out the use of whips, '
            'except when necessary for safety, to the national body, Racing '
            'Australia. It caused tensions at Racing Australia to boil over to '
            'the point that the organisation appointed an independent '
            'chairperson for the first time in its history, but there’s no '
            'public resolution on the issue so far.\n'
            'Racing Australia was previously chaired by Peter V’Landys, the '
            'chair of Racing NSW, which does not support Victoria’s push to '
            'reform whip use and has branded it a distracting PR exercise. '
            'There are limited studies showing the effect of whip use on '
            'horses and racing is not the only discipline to use a whip – it’s '
            'just the most high profile. But an Australian study which '
            'examined the steward reports from whip-free apprentice races in '
            'the UK found no appreciable difference in run times or safety '
            'issues. Is all of this just a PR exercise? It’s not just a PR '
            'exercise, but the positive publicity is a significant factor. '
            'Having horses die during the biggest race in the country is very '
            'negative publicity; taking steps that could reduce those deaths '
            'will both reduce that negative publicity and improve horse '
            'welfare outcomes.\n'
            'Most of the advertising put out by the racing industry in '
            'Victoria ahead of this year’s Cup has been focused on horse '
            'welfare, showcasing retraining facilities and registered '
            'charities which focus on rehoming ex-racehorses. The industry has '
            'also spent several years working on making thoroughbreds a '
            'marketable riding horse in the very fashion-driven world of '
            'competitive equestrian sports. There are off the track specific '
            'dressage and showjumping events and the Racing Victoria Off The '
            'Track program sponsors the Garryowen, the most prestigious horse '
            'show class in the country. These programs lack the scale to '
            'retrain and find suitable homes for the more than 8,000 horses '
            'that exit the racing industry every year. There is also still a '
            'lack of data around what happens to racehorses after they retire. '
            'Racing Australia requires trainers or owners to record where they '
            'send their horses and publishes high-level data on those '
            'statistics annually but it only tracks the first move after '
            'racing, usually made before the horse turns 10. The average '
            'lifespan of a thoroughbred is 30 years. There is increasing '
            'agreement from both the thoroughbred industry and animal welfare '
            'groups that a meaningful aftercare strategy needs to consider the '
            'horse’s entire lifespan. A senate inquiry into this issue in 2018 '
            'recommended the establishment of a national horse database that '
            'would include all horses, not just racehorses, but progress has '
            'stalled. A separate working group of the racing industry and '
            'welfare experts established after an ABC story showing racehorses '
            'slaughtered at export abattoirs is expected to release a '
            'substantive report on thoroughbred aftercare shortly.',

{'article': 'When Dr Rebecca McGowan referred a severely asthmatic patient '
            'from Albury Wodonga to a local respiratory specialist, she '
            'considered the patient lucky to get an appointment in February. '
            '“No, February 2023,” the patient told her in tears. The '
            'respiratory clinic told McGowan it was at a point it could not '
            'take any more patients. So she pulled strings with a Melbourne '
            'specialist she knew at medical school. Her patient’s asthma is so '
            'bad that she cannot drive herself, so her sister will drive her '
            'to the capital, three and a half hours away. “It’s something '
            'rural people put up with, but it’s appalling,” McGowan says. The '
            '17-month wait to see a respiratory specialist is the worst, but '
            'McGowan says the waiting times for endocrinologists, '
            'neurologists, pain specialists and ADHD/ASD psychology '
            'assessments are all over six months, and psychiatrists and '
            'rheumatologists are taking no new patients at all. Albury Wodonga '
            'is a large rural town of more than 100,000 people. Its '
            'oncologists service 500,000 people as they cover a lot of rural '
            'Victoria and New South Wales, who prefer to travel to Albury '
            'rather than Melbourne for specialist services such as radiation. '
            'The situation has been exacerbated recently because so many '
            'appointments and elective surgeries have been delayed due to '
            'Covid-19. Dangerous health inequity Dr Marco Giuseppin, the chair '
            'of the Council of Rural Doctors at the Australian Medical '
            'Association, says “many areas of rural Australia face long wait '
            'times to see non-GP specialists … the AMA has long been concerned '
            'about this and its effect on health inequity in rural and remote '
            'Australia”.\n'
            '“The consequences of delay to care can mean that conditions '
            'progress, making them more difficult to treat and increasing '
            'potential suffering in our vulnerable remote communities,” '
            'Giuseppin says. McGowan says further consequences include '
            'increased anxiety for the patient as well the GP, frustration and '
            'anger, increased instances of chronic disease and '
            'hospitalisation, as well as increased instances of death. “Rural '
            'people have much higher death rates because we don’t have the '
            'same access to quality medical treatment,” she says. Sign up to '

            'In a submission to the inquiry into health in rural, regional and '
            'remote NSW, the Cancer Council said residents there had poorer '
            'cancer survival outcomes compared with their city counterparts, '
            'citing distance from, and availability of specialists and '
            'diagnostic services as a significant factor. “Nationally, '
            'five-year all-cancer survival decreases with increasing '
            'remoteness, from 62% for major cities to 55% for very remote '
            'areas,” the submission said. Because of the longer wait times '
            'locally, McGowan will routinely advise her patients to go to '
            'Melbourne or Sydney for a specialist opinion. They must add the '
            'cost of taking time off work and accommodation expenses to the '
            'specialist’s fees. But even this is often not possible for anyone '
            'who cannot drive, including many elderly and disabled patients, '
            'as public transport is “abysmal”, McGowan says. The federal '
            'regional health minister, David Gillespie, a gastroenterologist, '
            'says the medical profession needs to shift its mindset to solve '
            'the problem. “The problem we face is that too many of our GPs and '
            'non-GP specialists are bedded down in the bright lights of our '
            'capital cities, aided by the metro-centric focused training of '
            'specialists required by the colleges, and the metro-centric '
            'employment and placement of interns, residents and registrars in '
            'metropolitan public hospitals rather than regional and rural '
            'hospitals,” Gillespie says. “This is not an overnight problem – '
            'it takes at least 12 years of study and training to become a '
            'doctor, sometimes longer to be a sub-specialist. And it is not a '
            'problem that the federal government can resolve without the '
            'involvement and mindset shift of the medical profession itself.” '
            'The federal government is supporting the training of non-GP '
            'specialists in regional and rural areas through the specialist '
            'training program, with rural targets for each of the 13 '
            'participating medical specialist colleges. The program has '
            'increased the proportion of training delivered in regional, rural '
            'and remote areas from 309 training posts in 2018 to 413 in 2021. '
            'The program’s integrated rural training pipeline has provided a '
            'further 93 funded rural posts in 2021. ‘Dudded for access’ Peter '
            'Wakeford is a retired physician who specialised in '
            'gastroenterology and during his career serviced the north-west of '
            'NSW from Tamworth hospital, with one other physician. Wakeford '
            'describes times he would have a “hell of a day at work, go home '
            'for dinner and a guy from Walcha would ring at eight o’clock” '
            'which would require an hour’s drive followed by an hour’s '
            'consultation. “My [professional] partner and I made a promise, we '
            'would not be the doctor who couldn’t come,” Wakeford said.\n'
            'Wakeford describes keeping the radio playing loudly on drives to '
            'keep himself awake but many times having to sleep by the side of '
            'the road. He was only ever paid for the time spent with the '
            'patient, as there was no recompense for travel. Wakeford says '
            'they “always had difficulties recruiting because most people '
            'wanted to stay in the larger centres where you had access to '
            'second opinions, it wasn’t such a lonely existence.” He says '
            'lower incomes and lack of access to colleagues – essentially '
            '“being thrown on your own devices” – made medical professionals '
            'reluctant to work in regional Australia. “Rural people are dudded '
            'for access. It’s not understood by the big colleges. You have to '
            'live it, it’s not just a statistic,” Wakeford says. Giuseppin '
            'says two solutions have been shown to be effective. “The first '
            'involves the promotion of specialist training in regional and '
            'rural areas. The second solution is proposed by the developing '

            'with specialised skills relevant to their community. But '
            'Giuseppin says uptake has been limited by lack of remuneration '
            'and recognition of those skills, “as well as resistance from city '

{'article': 'Borrowers are rushing to lock in low interest rates amid '
            'gathering expectations Australia’s central bank will declare an '
            'end to its record low cash rate earlier than its current '
            'prediction of 2024. Economists say the Reserve Bank of Australia '
            'has little choice but to revise its rate rise timing given '
            'mounting evidence the economy is recovering quickly from the '
            'lengthy Covid-triggered lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. '
            'It’s one year since the RBA lowered its official rate to just '
            '0.1% and today’s board meeting is under pressure to state when it '
            'expects to raise it. No increase is imminent – and it’s now 11 '
            'years since the last rate rise – but markets are anticipating the '
            'bank will bring forward the timing of that move.\n'
            '“If they don’t go with a date, then my fear would be that the '
            'market will interpret that as a signal they could move as soon as '
            'early next year,” David Plank, ANZ’s head of Australian '
            'economics, said. At stake is the fate of interest rates for those '
            'with mortgages but also those seeking to enter a market where '
            'house prices continue to rise at an annual rate of more than 20%, '
            'new figures out today show. The RBA hasn’t raised rates since '
            'November 2010. Bank economists are tipping the increase will come '
            'towards the end of 2022 or into 2023, although the market is '
            'anticipating as many as four rises – or a full percentage point '
            'increase – in 2022. Analysts such as NAB’s chief economist Alan '
            'Oster dismiss the likelihood of rate rises next year as '
            '“garbage”, but they can point to a range of indicators of a '
            'reviving economy and the prospect of rising wages and prices to '
            'follow. The core consumer price index for the September quarter '
            'released last week came in at 2.1%, creeping into the RBA’s '
            'preferred 2-3% inflation band for the first time since early '
            '2016. Job ads in ANZ’s survey, out Monday, rose 6.2% in October, '
            'returning to a level reached in June prior to the lockdowns '
            'caused by Delta Covid outbreaks. In NSW alone, new job ads last '
            'month leapt 17%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories '

            'Plank said the speed of recovery in the jobs market suggests a '
            'rethink about unemployment. Since so many people had stopped '
            'looking for work, the true jobless rate was assumed to be much '
            'higher than the official rate of 4.6%. “One of the reasons '
            'participation [in the job market] dropped was that a lot of '
            'people that got laid off got told by their employer ‘you’ve got a '
            'job back with us as soon as we reopen’,” he said. “So they didn’t '
            'bother searching because they knew they had a job.” The ultra-low '
            'interest rates have fuelled rocketing house prices although there '
            'is evidence the propellant is losing some of its force. One is '
            'that modestly tighter lending controls kicked in from today but '
            'also because borrowing costs are starting to tick higher. Still, '
            'Australia’s house prices rose another 1.5% in October according '
            'to researchers CoreLogic in data out today. The advance was in '
            'line with the September rise, and left prices 21.6% higher than '
            'for a year earlier. Among the capitals, Sydney’s house prices '
            'added 1.5% for the month, while Melbourne’s gain was just under '
            '1%. Brisbane led the advance with a 2.5% rise in October but '
            'Perth notched its first negative monthly result since June, '
            'dropping 0.1%. “Housing prices continue to outpace wages by a '
            'ratio of about 12:1,” CoreLogic’s research director Tim Lawless '
            'said. “This is one of the reasons why first-homebuyers are '
            'becoming a progressively smaller component of housing demand.” '
            'Rents, meanwhile, were up 0.7% for the month, up from a pace of '
            '0.6% in September, according to the figures, which are not '
            'seasonally adjusted. New borrowing commitments for housing '
            'totalled $30.3b in September, according to Bureau of Statistics '
            'data out on Monday that were adjusted to take into account '
            'seasonal changes. That figure, though down 1.4% from the previous '
            'month, remains 35.5% higher than a year earlier. Historically, '
            'about 85% of mortgages have been at variable rates and the rest '
            'at fixed ones. During the plunge in borrowing costs after Covid’s '
            'first wave, that ratio has shifted to about 50-50 as borrowers '
            'flock to secure the lower interest rates, Plank said.\n'
            'As loans typically take three months or so to come through, '
            'borrowers are already seeing market rates starting to rise. That '
            'is one factor curbing future house price rises, NAB’s Oster said. '
            '“You are probably going to mainly see [a slowing in the growth '
            'rate] by about early next year, and you might see house prices '
            'flattish from the middle of the year,” he said. So that means '
            'only a 5% increase or so in 2022 compared with about 25% this '
            'year. The rapid changes in the market are adding to the '
            'challenges faced by the RBA to steady the economic ship. GDP '
            'dropped at annual rate of about 3.5% in the September quarter and '
            'will probably rise about 3% in the final three months of 2021, '
            'Oster said. “So you’re going to have this sort of massive fall,” '
            'he said. “But then you get a big bounce because people are now '
            'believing that lockdowns are gone, particularly in New South '
            'Wales and Victoria.”',

            'make up about 3% of the approximately 100,000 applications each '
            'year. People with acquired brain impairment, chronic pain, '
            'infectious diseases, skin disorder and burns saw an 11 percentage '
            'point increase in rejected claims. The report did not analyse '
            'separate eligibility changes introduced by the Gillard '
            'government, including new “impairment tables”, which experts say '
            'made it much harder for applicants to get the pension.\n'
            'The Gillard and Abbott-era reforms aimed to reduce spending on '
            'the disability support pension, but in doing so have led to a '
            'record number of people who are sick or have disabilities on the '
            'jobseeker payment. The new report comes with renewed focus on the '
            'payment, amid an ongoing Senate inquiry. The disability '
            'discrimination commissioner, Ben Gauntlett, told the inquiry on '
            'Monday the eligibility criteria and application process were '
            '“onerous” and the government should consider whether they were '
            '“fit for purpose”. Last week, the social services minister, Anne '
            'Ruston, was forced to defend the system after Guardian Australia '
            'reported the story of 29-year-old brain cancer patient George '
            'Upjohn, who is struggling to make ends meet on the much lower '
            'jobseeker payment. Campaigners say cancer patients generally '
            'struggle to get on to the payment until their condition is '
            'terminal and that changes are needed to rules that require a '
            'condition to be “fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised”. Sign '

            'Former hospital worker Julie Stephen, 56, was rejected for the '
            'disability support pension while battling breast cancer last '
            'year. After doctors found a lump in her breast, Stephen underwent '
            'chemotherapy, including a four-week course of the so-called “red '
            'devil”, a lumpectomy and radiation. She finished radiation in '
            'April and was cleared of breast cancer in June, though she said '
            'she still had not recovered from “what they call that chemo '
            'brain”. Stephen said she was fortunate her time on jobseeker '
            'payment coincided with a massive boost to the dole through the '
            'coronavirus supplement, which was withdrawn in March. She called '
            'for more support, saying people with cancer need to focus on '
            'their recovery. “The system needs a backup to help cancer '
            'patients that does not require them to jump through hoops to be '
            'considered.”\n'
            'The HOI report found that people were now mostly like to have '
            'their claim fail because their condition was not “fully '
            'diagnosed, treated and stabilised”, with this making up 53% of '
            'all denied applications. Previously people had been more likely '
            'to be rejected because their condition did not garner 20 points '
            'on the impairment tables, meaning it was not considered severe '
            'enough. The report found the Abbott government’s changes were '
            '“appropriate relating to the policy intent, and effective in '
            'improving the integrity” of the disability support pension and '
            'were “cost-effective”, but noted they also “increased the time of '
            'decision making”. A person could have been expected to wait 54 '
            'days on average in 2014, a figure that rose to 84 days by 2019. '
            'For some conditions the average wait was even longer, with cancer '
            'patients waiting an average of 96 days by 2019, people with '
            'chronic pain waiting 109 days, and people with intellectual '
            'disabilities waiting 113 days. The report made a number of minor '
            'recommendations, including the introduction of a new reporting '
            'template for a person’s treating doctor to submit as part of '
            'their application. Economic Justice Australia was among the '
            'groups that welcomed that recommendation on Monday. Ruston has '
            'insisted that the system is working, but Labor’s social services '
            'spokeswoman, Linda Burney, said the 2015 changes were '
            '“problematic”, particularly “forcing people to be assessed by '
            'doctors who don’t know them, instead of their own treating doctor '
            'who knows them best”. A department of social services '
            'spokesperson said the 2015 changes were “aimed at improving the '
            'integrity of the assessment process in applying the existing '
            'eligibility criteria”. “The evaluation found that the changes '
            'were appropriate and effective,” the spokesperson said. • Do you '

{'article': 'Finding a super-sized bed to sleep in or a car with a suitably '
            'generous amount of legroom are not generally details a sporting '
            'club must consider when negotiating the acquisition of a new '
            'player. But then again, Liu Chuanxing is not your average '
            'athlete. Standing at 7ft 5in (226cm), the China international '
            'will become the tallest player in National Basketball League '
            'history when he makes his first appearance for the Brisbane '
            'Bullets this coming season. The 22-year-old, already given the '
            'moniker “Big Liu” by his new club, arrived in Australia last '
            'week. Having emerged from a two-week stint in hotel quarantine, '
            'where he had the time to get to know his new teammates by '
            'searching their profiles online, Liu took part in his first '
            'training session with the Bullets on Monday.\n'
            'Interest has been suitably piqued by his presence, not only due '
            'to the clear novelty factor of his stature (he was asked what '
            'size shoe he takes – 18, for the record) but also for the impact '
            'a player of his size could potentially have on the game in '
            'Australia. Already capped by China, the young centre’s imposing '
            'figure is an entirely unknown entity in the NBL and how '
            'opposition defences deal with his size remains to be seen. “He’s '
            'a big fella,” said Bullets point guard Jason Cadee, who has been '
            'assigned to look after his new teammate and make him feel '
            'welcome. “He moves pretty well for someone so big.” Liu, who does '
            'not yet speak English, will also be shadowed by a translator '
            'during his time in Australia, although once he steps onto the '
            'court communication will pose a different hurdle to overcome. '
            'Cadee said it would take time, but the use of hand signals, '
            'certain words and names would be employed at the outset. “The '
            'language barrier is probably going to be one of the most '
            'difficult things, just trying to translate and talk to him on the '
            'floor,” Cadee said. “But if we can keep it simple enough I think '
            'he’ll be able to help us. “He’s going to make people look very '
            'small, he’s so big. He’s a presence. I don’t know if he’s going '
            'to be a guy who we see play 20 or 25 minutes, but if we can get '
            'him to play 10 or 12 minutes and be effective and get him in '
            'positions to be successful he’ll be a presence on the floor.” The '
            'Bullets, and Cadee in particular, have been helpful in welcoming '
            'Liu as he embarks on his Australian adventure. “The club has '
            'helped me with the whole trip, from quarantine,” Liu said. “Jason '
            'is a very good guy. He has tried to make me fit into this team as '
            'soon as possible.” Liu has had a space allocated to him next to '
            'Cadee in the locker room and Bullets assistant general manager '
            'Sam Mackinnon indicated there may even be some efforts made from '
            'the English-speaking squad to learn Mandarin in an attempt to '
            'make assimilation easier. Speaking through his interpreter on '
            'Monday, Liu said he would do his best to break down the language '
            'barrier, but he was not expecting it to be easy at first. “It’s a '
            'little bit hard to remember their names first time,” he said. '
            '“This is my first time in Australia, so it’s a new environment. '
            'It takes some time to get used to it. But I will learn a little '
            'bit of English and remember all of their names. Right now, I '
            'remember most of them.” At Brisbane airport after Liu touched '
            'down on Australian soil last week, Mackinnon pointed to the '
            'commercial benefits of having Liu on board and said the player’s '
            'ability to attract a crowd was there “for all to see today”. '
            '“Most importantly for the club, we think he can play basketball '
            'and that’s where he’s going to be a massive asset for us,” '
            'Mackinnon said. “It’s great to have him here. He’s a big fella '
            'and has a unique skills set to go with that. So he has the whole '
            'package and we’re glad he’s with us.” The move is the result of '
            'months of planning as Liu’s acquisition was organised over a '
            'series of online calls, with the difficulties posed by Covid and '
            'the player’s particular requirements presenting unique '
            'challenges. “We met him a few months ago,” Mackinnon said. “Zoom '
            'calls, talking about the opportunity with the Bullets, what he '
            'would need – like a translator. Liu was happy to come by himself '
            'but there are little things like, what kind of car does he get '
            'around in? What kind of bed does he sleep in? He’s a big guy. '
            '“Now we have him here he gets to do what he’s great at – and '
            'that’s play basketball.” Liu will be joined in the NBL by his '
            'compatriot Zhou Qi, after the former NBA player was also unveiled '
            'on Monday by South East Melbourne Phoenix. Zhou, who stands at '
            '7ft 1in (216cm), played 12 games off the bench for the Houston '
            'Rockets between 2017 and 2019 and still harbours hopes of '

            'The retired Sam Harris, who played for the Perth Wildcats, '

{'article': 'The Morrison government’s plan to reach net zero emissions by '
            '2050 was quickly revealed to be based on laughable projections. '
            'But even worse, the latest projections for emissions to 2030, '
            'also released last week, reveal the government has totally given '
            'up on the Paris agreement and the task to keep warming below '
            'either 1.5C or 2C. If you listened to the prime minister or read '
            'some compliant reporting over the past week you might think the '
            'latest greenhouse gas projections are a triumph. But if you '
            'examine the figures rather than the media release, it’s clear '
            'that Australia’s task to do our share to limit warming to either '
            '1.5C or 2C is harder now than it was projected to be last year. '
            'First let’s look at the change in projections from 2020.\n'
            'Last year, the industry department projected Australia would emit '
            '479m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030 – 22% below the 615m tonnes '
            'emitted in 2005. But the projections also included a “high '
            'technology sensitivity” scenario – a scenario in which technology '
            'improved faster than expected. That projection had Australia '
            'emitting 436m tonnes of CO2 in 2030 – 29% below 2005 levels. And '
            'would you believe it – technology has improved faster! As Ketan '
            'Joshi first noted, the government has effectively taken the 2020 '
            'high technology scenario and made it the baseline in 2021. That '
            'sleight of hand has the government now projecting 439m tonnes of '
            'emissions in 2030. Not only that, emissions in 2005 were revised '
            'up to 624m tonnes, giving us the 30% fall below 2005 levels by '
            '2030:\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here The government '
            'insists the cuts come from measures announced in the 2021-22 '
            'budget such as “$464m clean hydrogen industrial hubs program”, '
            '“funding to support the development of carbon capture” and '
            'measures such as the “implementation of the safeguard crediting '
            'mechanism” and “support for voluntary climate action through an '
            'expanded climate active framework.” If that all sounds like '
            'bunkum, it’s because it is. The government’s own figures show '
            'that all of the difference in actual emissions from last year’s '
            'projections come from electricity – ie the shift away from coal:\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here It means, as the '
            'Greens leader Adam Bandt has noted, while the figures anticipate '
            '“the closure of 11GW of coal capacity”, the government is '
            'simultaneously pursuing “electricity subsidies, carbon capture '
            'handouts and the Collinsville coal-fired power station '
            'feasibility study, all designed to keep coal in the system for '
            'longer”. Even more absurdly, these new technology improvements '
            'that will supposedly lead to greater emissions cuts are only set '
            'to occur after 2024:\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here The government '
            'actually predicts more emissions until 2025 than it did a year '
            'ago. The problem is that while the government keeps reducing its '
            'estimate for emissions in 2030, it also recalculates the actual '
            'emissions that have occurred since 1990 – and they keep rising.\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here The latest '
            'projections have Australia emitting a further 195m tonnes CO2 '
            'over the 40 years from 1990 than was projected last year. This '
            'matters because, as I have noted previously, we need to stay '
            'within our carbon budget. The Climate Change Authority has '
            'estimated that to stay under 2C, Australia could only emit '
            '10,100m tonnes of CO2 from 2013 to 2050. The Climate Targets '
            'Panel earlier this year re-calculated it to be 10,400m tonnes. '
            'Last year’s projections suggested Australia had used up 4,239m '
            'tonnes of that total. But the latest figures suggest Australia '
            'had now used 4,287m tonnes. That means our remaining budget from '
            '2021 onwards has fallen from 6,161m to 6,113m tonnes. To stay '
            'under 1.5C, Australia can only emit 7,760m tonnes of CO2, but the '
            'latest figures suggest we now have only 3,473m tonnes remaining. '
            'To put it another way, we have used up 55% of our carbon budget '
            'for the 37 years from 2013 to 2050 in just eight years. The '
            'purpose of the Paris agreement was to hold “the increase in the '
            'global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial '
            'levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to '
            '1.5C above pre-industrial levels”. The latest figures suggest we '
            'will exceed our 1.5C budget in 2027 and the 2C budget in 2034 '
            'even if after 2030 we go on a direct path to net zero by 2050:\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here To stay within '
            'our 1.5C budget we would need to start on a path to reach net '
            'zero by 2033 – this would require an 80% cut from 2005 levels by '
            '2030.\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here Even the task for '
            'staying within our 2C budget is tough.\n'
            'On the current projections, after 2030 we would need to cut '
            'emissions by 63m tonnes a year – nine times more than the current '
            'projections of a 7m tonnes cut each year:\n'
            'If the graph does not display please click here By contrast a 50% '
            'cut by 2030 would then give us until 2044 to get to net zero. The '
            'latest greenhouse gas projections are a farce, based on '
            'technological pipe dreams not even reflected in the figures. But '
            'worse, they confirm that the government has effectively given up '
            'on Australia doing its share to keep temperatures from rising by '
            'more than either 1.5C or 2C. The government’s own figures show '
            'that its net zero by 2050 target is nowhere near enough to limit '
            'global warming to safe levels. • Greg Jericho writes on economics '

            'Paulo Fonseca, Gennaro Gattuso, Dave from Chas & Dave and several '

            'everyone on the planet knew he was nowhere near the club’s first '
            'choice. Fast forward four months and Nuno was left looking like a '
            'sad spaniel who’s just realised he’s being taken to the vet, as '
            '62,000 enraged Tottenham fans booed one of the most “Lads, It’s '
            'Tottenham” capitulations in recent memory. To nobody’s great '
            'surprise, Nuno was finally put out of his misery this morning, '
            'with everyone apart from those who decided to employ him in the '
            'first place having known from the get-go that he’d almost '

{'article': 'China’s president, Xi Jinping, has called on developed countries '
            'to “provide support to help developing countries do better” in '
            'dealing with the climate crisis, in a written statement to the '
            'Cop26 climate conference that fails to make any new significant '
            'pledges. The Chinese leader also urged all parties to take '
            'stronger actions to “jointly tackle the climate challenge”, and '
            'said his country would “speed up the green and low-carbon energy '
            'transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and '
            'build large wind and photovoltaic power stations”. China is the '
            'world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, making it a '
            'key player at Cop26, the latest round of talks aimed at '
            'strengthening the fight against global heating, which began on '
            'Sunday. Despite this, Xi, who has not left China since 2020 amid '
            'the Covid pandemic, had not been expected to attend the '
            'conference in person. He was the only world leader so far to '
            'deliver remarks to the conference in written form, although '
            'another significant no-show – Russia’s Vladimir Putin – is '
            'expected to send a video message to a related UN conference on '
            'forestry and land use. “We have been very clear as hosts that we '
            'welcome everyone to participate, but it will be in-person,” said '
            'Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, last week.\n'
            'Xi’s message to Cop26 echoes his speech at the G20 summit in Rome '
            'over the weekend, in which he participated via video link. On '
            'Sunday night, he spoke to those there at length about the climate '
            'crisis, urging countries to “balance environmental protection and '
            'economic development, address climate change and safeguard '
            'people’s livelihood”, and saying that “major economies should '
            'strengthen cooperation in this regard”. “The G20 members should '
            'take the lead in promoting and applying advanced technologies, '
            'and developed countries should also earnestly fulfil their '
            'commitments to providing funds for developing countries,” he '
            'added. In updated pledges, China confirmed to the UN last week '
            'that it would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and cut '
            'them to net zero by 2060. It also promised to raise total wind '
            'and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 in '
            'order to reach its goals. However, climate watchers were hoping '
            'for new pledges to cap energy consumption and an earlier start to '
            'reducing the use of coal, currently scheduled to begin in 2026, '
            'adding to pressure on China from other world leaders to promise '
            'more. Last Tuesday, Macron asked Xi during a phone call to send '
            'the world a “decisive signal” on the climate emergency, according '
            'to the French presidency. Xi also spoke with Boris Johnson on '
            'Friday. A Chinese government statement said the two leaders spoke '
            'about topics ranging from bilateral ties to sustainability. Xi '
            'said Beijing would “do what it says” when it came to its green '
            'and low-carbon development. The statement added that he said '
            'China’s goals would mean a “broad and profound economic and '
            'societal change”, and that that would be done “step by step and '
            '[through] hard work”.\n'
            'Climate analysts quoted by the Reuters news agency said the '
            'latest arrangement could indicate that the world’s biggest CO2 '
            'producer “has already decided that it has no more concessions to '
            'offer at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Scotland after three '
            'major pledges since last year”. But Qin Yan, a lead analyst at '
            'Refinitiv financial analysis, said the domestic situation in '
            'China should not be ignored in understanding Xi’s decision to '
            'deliver the speech in a written format. “Complicated domestic '
            'politics ahead of the Communist party’s sixth plenum on 8-11 '
            'November in Beijing is definitely Xi’s focus now. It is crucial '
            'for him to continuing a third term at the congress next autumn. '
            'And the current energy crunch in China is complicating climate '
            'policy, too,” Qin said. She added that the choice of written '
            'statement was “also to show China’s top leadership cares about UN '
            'climate talks, but it is not its top priority”. “It looks like '
            'China prefers to leave more room for negotiations in bilateral '
            'talks rather than showing all the cards at the plenary. Look at '
            'what the EU and the US just did bilaterally over Trump-era '
            'tariffs on steel and aluminium this weekend.”',

{'article': '“My doctors have said very clearly: ‘No more head injuries.’” So '
            'says Peter Tatchell, one of the world’s most tenacious, divisive '
            'and necessary activists, as he prepares to fly to Moscow in 2018 '
            'to protest against state-sanctioned homophobia. The trip, which '
            'returns him to the city where he was beaten and arrested in 2007, '
            'forms one of the few present-tense sections of this greatest '
            'hits-style documentary. Tatchell has sustained numerous injuries '
            'from his lifetime of protest, though claims of memory loss are '
            'comically undermined during a kid-gloves interview with Ian '
            'McKellen. “Fifty two years of civil disobedience, Peter!” gasps '
            'the actor admiringly. “Fifty three now,” Tatchell replies, unable '
            'to resist the lure of being right. As of this year, it’s 54. '
            'Tatchell was already an activist when he moved from Melbourne to '
            'London in 1971 at the age of 19. Among other achievements, he '
            'went on to stage the first gay rights protest in a communist '
            'country (East Germany, 1973), co-found the gay pressure group '
            'OutRage!, and attempt citizen’s arrests of Robert Mugabe (London, '
            '1999 and Brussels, 2001). The former MP Chris Smith correctly '
            'identifies those run-ins with the Zimbabwean dictator as turning '
            'points which softened public hostility toward Tatchell. How best '
            'to describe him? Is he “a performance artist” (as Stephen Fry '
            'says)? “A brave motherfucker” (singer and DJ Tom Robinson)? Or “a '
            'little bit of an irritant” (Smith)? Dr George Carey, the former '
            'archbishop of Canterbury, calls him “a bullying kind of chap”, '
            'but then he would say that: it was Carey’s 1998 Easter Sunday '
            'sermon that was hijacked by Tatchell, who rushed the pulpit to '
            'protest at the Church’s disdain for lesbian and gay rights.\n'
            'Analysis is thin on the ground in this chummy but functional '
            'film, with any ambiguity fleeting or accidental. Footage of the '
            '1983 Bermondsey byelection, for instance, at which Tatchell stood '
            'as a Labour candidate and lost after a homophobic campaign '
            'against him, shows him modifying his delivery on the doorstep, '
            'his clipped Aussie tones peppered with glottal stops and '
            'gor-blimey cheer. Why not ask about that? A ubiquitous score '
            'guides the viewer’s responses, and we get a bog-standard 1980s '
            'montage (Thatcher, royal wedding, Band Aid). One highlight is the '
            'footage of the 1990s “kiss-ins” organised by OutRage!, at which '
            'gay protesters risked prosecution by snogging in front of police '
            'and cameras. If only the film-makers had bothered to identify '
            'Derek Jarman during his 20 seconds or so of screen time, rather '
            'than reducing Britain’s foremost queer film director to Man in '
            'Crowd.\n'
            'Those unfamiliar with Tatchell or unconvinced of his significance '

{'article': 'Exam boards could be asked to avoid using “complex language” '
            'including colloquialisms, sarcasm and idioms in assessments to '
            'make them more accessible for pupils. Ofqual, the exams regulator '
            'in England, has published draft guidance aimed at tackling the '
            'ways in which some pupils are “unfairly disadvantaged by '
            'irrelevant features” in exams, making it harder to determine '
            'their knowledge, skills and understanding. This includes pupils '
            'who are deaf, blind, autistic and dyslexic, as well as those who '
            'have English as an additional language, and those who are '
            'unfamiliar with certain humour and customs, as well as housing, '
            'family arrangements and certain cultural, social or travel '
            'experiences. The guidance, on which Ofqual is seeking views until '
            '24 January, could come into force in spring 2022 if approved. It '
            'would especially apply to assessments that are not seeking to '
            'assess the understanding of complex language, such as for maths '
            'or other numerical skills-based subjects. The document recommends '
            'that exam boards replace abstract nouns, colloquialisms, '
            'metaphors, idioms and sarcasm with language that is “accessible, '
            'clear and plain” as well as “unambiguous”. It adds that source '
            'material, context, images and colour in an exam should not “use '
            'unnecessary negative, narrow or stereotypical representations of '
            'particular groups”, nor should it “advantage of disadvantage any '
            'group” of pupils, for example, by relating disproportionately to '
            'a particular socioeconomic context where this is not relevant to '
            'the assessment. The document further proposes that images be used '
            'only when integral to the assessment, since these can be open to '
            'interpretation, while layouts should be accessible and schools '
            'should improve their use of assistive technology. The draft '
            'guidance further discourages schools from setting more demanding '
            'tasks at the beginning of the exam, which might “demotivate” some '
            'learners and prevent them from fully demonstrating the required '
            'knowledge in the rest of the exam. Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief '
            'regulator, said: “The best interests of students are the compass '
            'that guides us. We regulate so that assessments enable every '
            'student to demonstrate what they know, understand and can do – '
            'without unnecessary barriers. It is crucial that assessments are '
            'as accessible as possible for all students.”',

{'article': 'In the corner of New Art Exchange in Nottingham, I pop on a '
            'cassette tape and listen to multidisciplinary artist Simnikiwe '
            'Buhlungu. She tells me her feet are wet and that she’s lost and '
            'about self-determination. But it is her proclamation about '
            'togetherness that catches my attention: “self can be a '
            'community,” she explains. In a world where the individual is '
            'prized, hitching the concept of identity to external forces seems '
            'radical and risky. But this is exactly what Laced – a group '
            'exhibition of seven female artists with links to Africa and its '
            'diasporas – asks us to attempt. On a basic level, we are all '
            'aware of the ways in which others have shaped us – the way we '
            'intonate like our parents or vote like our friends. Laced dials '
            'it up a few notches, uncovering links to history and geography, '
            'spreading connections out across the gallery like the delicately '
            'threaded textile the exhibition is named after. My green jumper '
            'starts to disappear into the green walls, which blends into Zohra '
            'Opoku’s photograph of lush foliage. Beneath the branches is an '
            'obscured female figure – I catch a glimpse of her eye, she stares '
            'back at me – and her immersion in the landscape questions my own '
            'relationship with the natural world.\n'
            'The seven artists’ work responds to a poetic text formulated by '
            'curator Loren Hansi Gordon to weave together a broad selection of '
            'ideas. Laced is about race (“how we wear our hair”), Nottingham '
            '(“history of this place”), liberty (“the art of being free”), '
            'heart (“love is as love does”) and fundamentally how we are able '
            '“to find ourselves in the other”. This plethora of concepts is '
            'articulated through thick swirls of paint, colloquial dialogue, '
            'bold photography, delicate needlework and hypnotising animation '
            'by artists with links across the globe. Rather than creating '
            'incoherence, the array of topics throws out endless points of '
            'connection. It is the personal in the works that reels us in. '
            'Buhlungu’s recordings of walks include profound ponderings, '
            'observations about location, burps and songs to generate a '
            'meandering monologue that reflects the spontaneous way in which '
            'all minds travel. Wura-Natasha Ogunji’s exquisite stitched human '
            'figures depict emotions that words can’t reach, while Michaela '
            'Yearwood-Dan’s cacophony of dense acrylic flicks, scrapes and '
            'dabs with hidden phrases like “when will I finally figure out '
            'what it is to be free?” is joyous and volatile like the '
            'contradiction of being alive.\n'
            'Connection also means taking responsibility. Tabita Rezaire’s '
            'panoramic video explores how the internet continues to perpetuate '
            'oppressive hierarchies. From the physical infrastructure – the '
            'routes of which mimic those of the slave traders – to the way in '
            'which Google’s algorithm’s suggestions include “why is Africa '
            'poor” and “why Africans don’t wear deodorant”, Rezaire condenses '
            'history to illustrate how interconnectivity can be abusive and '
            'how our past shapes our present. “West needs new spaces to '
            'conquer” stretches out across the screen, challenging us to '
            'acknowledge the ills of previous generations and how our quest to '
            'defend “power at all costs” is far from over. A quirk of Covid '
            'rescheduling means that upstairs another seven artists tackle the '
            'topic of Black British masculinities in Cut & Mix. Dialogues '
            'naturally open up between the two exhibitions, and the '
            'similarities between Amartey Golding’s flower-obscured Black men '
            'and Opoku’s fauna-hidden women narrate how excessively '
            'restrictive gender identities have negative implications on both '
            'sides of the coin. The need for women to appear a certain way '
            'boxes men into a corner too.\n'
            'For Black men, this corner is smaller than ever – as many of the '
            'works in Cut & Mix reveal. Heavyweight Champ by Antonio Roberts '
            'features recoded video games with Black characters from fighting '
            'games. Balrog from Street Fighter II races across a Mario game, '
            'while Adam Hunter from Streets of Rage pops up i Donkey Kong. '
            'Later, Beverley Bennett places the words of female musicians in '
            'the mouths of male gospel singers, Marlene Smith wears the '
            'clothes of her late father and Michael Forbes juxtaposes '
            'multicoloured wigs and diamante-adorned hats with stern facial '
            'expressions. Reframing not only exposes the narrow and '
            'restrictive path Black men are often required to walk, it also '
            'offers an alternative where vulnerability, sensitivity and '
            'flamboyancy have a place. At the back of the gallery is a dimly '
            'lit orange room. Bennett’s gospel singers and the aroma from a '
            'scented diffuser fill the air as I look at a photographic '
            'portrait by Rotimi Fani-Kayode. Two Black men stand close, facing '
            'the camera – the first, draped in a red robe, looks heavenward – '
            'while the second nuzzles into his shoulder. The certainty and '
            'stillness of the first man allays the concerns of the second, '
            'offering him a place of refuge and rest. Senses alight in the '
            'warm, closed space, it is as though I have stumbled upon a chapel '
            'at the end of a long journey. With a head full of ideas, I too '
            'wish to rest upon this man’s shoulder. Connection is not easy, '
            'but it is all we have. Laced: In Search of What Connects Us and '

{'article': 'Before the Map At night, I feel at home with these hills. They '
            'lie down beside me like cattle in the dirt they are in. I call '
            'them in the dark and they shift like cattle do, Sanga cows, or '
            'Highland cows, like kine, like kin. I know I’m not the only one. '
            'Secretly at night they settle down by each of us, keep us warm, '
            'and in. These are the names I give them: Kith. Oom. Sough. Ox. '
            'Gert. Brute. Tlou. Seth. Olifant Cough. Olifant Bone.\n'
            'Carola Luther was born and brought up in rural South Africa, came '
            'to England in 1981 and currently lives in West Yorkshire. When '
            'writing about her local environment in her third collection, On '
            'the Way to Jerusalem Farm, she often senses complications in the '
            'pastoral scene. Besides forebodings of ecological disaster, '
            'anxiety flows in from current world events and takes '
            'hallucinatory shape: in Balance, for example, an abandoned '
            'tractor becomes “a wrecked boat leaning / under the weight of '
            'birds”, while in Sheep, the single, terrified animal racing '
            'towards her begins to resemble a young woman fleeing for her '
            'life. Luther’s pastoral is prone to disorientation and '
            'estrangement. But such estrangement has a positive side: it '
            'heightens colour and light, and sometimes sets a strand of '
            'mythic-animal storytelling in progress. In this week’s poem, '
            'Before the Map, enrichment flows directly from the past, both in '
            'terms of pre-linguistic consciousness and the discovery and '
            'rediscovery of language. Feeling “at home” with the hills depends '
            'on the writer’s not having found out their written names. The map '
            'is still close-folded, places haven’t been dislodged or penned in '
            'by naming. The hills “lie down beside me like cattle / in the '
            'dirt they are in”. They are “of” as well as “in” the dirt. Their '
            'presence prompts an early memory, and the speaker seems at home '
            'with the way “they shift” when their names are called in the '
            'dark. Two breeds are mentioned, “Sanga cows, or Highland cows …” '
            'Sanga cattle are the indigenous cattle of sub-Saharan Africa; '
            'Highland cattle originally migrated from Africa and Europe to '
            'settle in Scotland and the Outer Hebrides. The difference between '
            'the breeds is unimportant. The hills resemble both, and, as '
            '“kine” they evolve easily into “kin”. “I know I’m not the only '
            'one” seems a glad rather than grudging recognition. Humans become '
            'herd creatures now in the third tercet, linked in wider kinship. '
            'The cattle “settle down by each of us” like protective ancestral '
            'spirits. The last line of the third tercet satisfyingly takes up '
            'and revises the preposition (“in”) from the first line. People '
            'are safely contained. The hills “keep us warm, and in”. Luther’s '
            'assortment of names emphasises consonantal variety. The sounds '
            'slumberous cattle make are evoked in “Sough” and “Ox”. “Gert” '
            'shortens the old name “Gertrude”, that of the German Benedictine '
            'nun and saint, adding various associations of female strength and '
            'tenacity. “Kith” echoes with the earlier terms, kine and kin; '
            '“Brute” has the heft of a bull. “Seth” has biblical connotations: '
            'it was the name of Adam and Eve’s third son, thought by Eve to be '
            'God’s replacement for the murdered Abel. There’s also a '
            'working-class ring to these once popular English-adopted '
            'Christian names. Luther draws some of the cattle names from her '
            'South African heritage. An end-note tells us that “Oom” means '
            '“uncle” in Afrikaans, and that “Tlou” and “Olifant” mean elephant '
            '“in Sesotho and Afrikaans respectively”. Even in this gentle '
            'pastoral, death is present. “Olifant Cough” may suggest that the '
            'animal, displaced in a northern climate, has caught cold, and '
            '“Olifant Bone” inevitably signals either natural death or the '
            'work of hunters and poachers. At the same time, the cough may '
            'simply be a harmless sound, and bone might indicate the living '
            'structure that has sturdily made its home in the changing hills '
            'of Luther’s imagination. • A spelling mistake in the caption has '
            'been amended. It previously read “Ilkey”, not “Ilkley”',

{'article': 'As Jane Austen famously put it in Emma, “there is nothing like '
            'staying at home for real comfort”. Now the roof on the novelist’s '
            'own home is set to be restored, after funds were raised to save '
            'it through public donations and a grant from the government. '
            'Austen lived in Chawton, Hampshire, for the last eight years of '
            'her life, writing novels including Sense and Sensibility, Pride '
            'and Prejudice and Emma there – “Nobody can be more devoted to '
            'home than I am,” continues the attention-seeking Mrs Elton in the '
            'latter. The roof of the cottage was last refurbished in 1948, '
            'before it opened to the public as Jane Austen’s House Museum, and '
            'major repairs are now needed, according to staff, who have been '
            'working to raise money to restore it since last year.\n'
            'More than 30,000 handmade clay roof tiles are needed to restore '
            'the roof of the Grade I-listed property, with contractors also '
            'required to ensure the works do not disturb the rare bats that '
            'share the site. A public fundraising appeal to sponsor a roof '
            'tile has so far raised over £64,000, while a grant from Hampshire '
            'County Council has brought a further £85,000. A third tranche of '
            '£85,597, from Historic England and the Historic Houses Foundation '
            'from the second round of the Heritage Stimulus Fund, means work '

            'and during the festive season.\n'
            '“It is truly excellent news that Jane Austen’s House has been '

            'Hampshire County Council and the thousands of people across the '

{'article': 'Jes Staley, Barclays’ chief executive for the past six years, is '
            'stepping down after City regulators shared with him and the bank '
            'preliminary findings of an investigation over how he described '
            'his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey '
            'Epstein. However, Staley plans to challenge the Financial Conduct '
            'Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation '
            'Authority (PRA) over their conclusions, meaning it could take '
            'much longer before the findings are released to the public. We '
            'take a closer look at what we know about the case and its '
            'consequences so far.\n'
            'What does the investigation cover? According to Barclays, the '
            'investigation focused on the way Staley characterised his '
            'relationship with Epstein to Barclays, and how Barclays '
            'subsequently described that relationship to the FCA when asked '
            'for further information. The FCA has not commented on the scope '
            'of the investigation, or its preliminary findings, which have '
            'been shared with Staley and Barclays but have yet to be released '
            'to the public. What prompted the investigation? The joint FCA and '
            'PRA inquiry was launched after emails between Staley and Epstein '
            'were handed to the UK regulators by their counterparts in the US. '
            'Those emails were reportedly supplied by JP Morgan Chase and '
            'dated to Staley’s time at the US bank. According to the Financial '
            'Times, which first reported on the correspondence, the emails '
            'suggested their relationship was friendly. JP Morgan and Barclays '
            'have declined to comment on the emails. “Obviously I thought I '
            'knew him well, and I didn’t,” Staley told reporters last year '
            'when the investigation was made public. “And for sure with '
            'hindsight of what we know now, I deeply regret having had any '
            'relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.” What do we know about '
            'Staley’s relationship with Epstein? The American banker has said '
            'he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000, when he was '
            'hired to lead JP Morgan’s private bank, which handles wealthy '
            'clients. However, Staley stayed in contact with Epstein for seven '
            'years after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a '
            'minor in 2008, and visited Epstein in Florida while he was still '
            'serving his sentence and on work release in 2009. He continued '
            'his relationship with Epstein after he left JPMorgan to join '
            'hedge fund BlueMountain Capital in 2013, but claims the '
            'relationship started to taper off after he left the bank. The two '
            'men met for a final time in 2015, when Staley took his own yacht, '
            'the Bequia, to visit Epstein’s private Caribbean island. Staley '
            'volunteered to explain his ties to Epstein to Barclays in summer '
            '2019, when media reports cast a fresh spotlight on their '
            'relationship. It is still not clear why Staley decided to cut '
            'ties with his former banking client. Epstein died in prison in '
            'August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking '
            'underage girls. A US medical examiner ruled he killed himself. '
            'Has Staley been implicated in other controversies since joining '
            'Barclays in 2015? Yes. Staley was personally fined almost '
            '£650,000, and ordered to repay £500,000 of his bonus, for twice '
            'attempting to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Staley used the '
            'bank’s internal security unit to try to discover who had written '
            'letters to the board regarding a new hire at Barclays, who was '
            'also a former friend and colleague of Staley’s at JP Morgan. '
            'Staley apologised to the bank’s board after the investigation. '
            'Later in 2017, Staley caused a rift between private equity giant '
            'KKR and Barclays after backing his brother-in-law in a '
            'complicated legal dispute with the buyout house. While Staley '
            'argued that he was involved in a personal capacity, rather than '
            'as chief executive of Barclays, it strained the bank’s '
            'relationship with one of its longtime clients. When will we learn '
            'more about the City regulators’ findings? That is still unclear. '
            'The FCA usually shares preliminary findings with the subjects of '
            'its investigation about a month before releasing them to the '
            'public and issuing any potential fines or penalties. While most '
            'companies tend to accept and settle the investigation, often '
            'resulting in smaller fines, Staley plans to contest the findings '
            'by bringing the case to the FCA’s regulatory decisions committee '
            '(RDC). Staley could also appeal to the RDC to keep the document '
            'under wraps on privacy grounds, while the process gets under way. '
            'If he wins, and argues for privacy, it is possible that the '
            'details of the investigation are never publicly released. It is '
            'not yet clear on which grounds Staley plans to challenge the '
            'findings. It is understood that Barclays is unlikely to cover any '
            'associated legal costs, given Staley’s resignation.\n'
            'What does this mean for Barclays? It is not clear whether '
            'Barclays is implicated in the investigation’s findings or any '
            'wrongdoing in relation to the case. However, in the bank’s words, '
            'the inquiry not only dealt with Staley’s characterisation of the '
            'relationship with Epstein, but Barclays’ subsequent portrayal of '

{'article': 'Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was met with cheers and jeers '
            'as he visited a small Italian town on Monday to collect honorary '
            'citizenship. Bolsonaro’s great-grandfather was born in Anguillara '
            'Veneta, a town of 4,200 people in the Veneto region. Tensions '
            'have been brewing since its far-right mayor, Alessandra Buoso, '
            'approved granting honorary citizenship to the far-right leader. '
            'Last week, protesters spray-painted the wall of the town hall '
            'with the words “Bolsonaro Out” while the bishop of nearby Padua '
            'described the honorary citizenship as “a great embarrassment”. '
            'Bolsonaro arrived in Anguillara Veneta after attending the G20 '
            'summit in Rome, where he was filmed walking around the city’s '
            'cultural sites and sampling food.\n'
            'He was greeted with cheers by supporters who had wrapped '
            'themselves in the Brazilian flag, while about 200 protesters held '
            'banners saying: “Justice for the Amazon” and “No citizenship for '
            'dictators”. The visit comes days after Brazilian senators '
            'recommended that Bolsonaro face criminal charges for the '
            'country’s more than 600,000 Covid-19 deaths. Andrea Zanoni, an '
            'environment councillor in the Veneto region for the centre-left '
            'Democratic party, was among the protesters. Zanoni said the '
            'honorary citizenship was an “incomprehensible choice” amid '
            'accusations of “crimes against humanity” against Bolsonaro and '
            'his “nefarious” handling of the pandemic. “But not only that: '
            'Bolsonaro’s policies are a disaster for the planet,” said Zanoni. '
            '“He has laid out the red carpet for multinationals that are '
            'devastating the Amazon and dismantled environmental controls. '
            'Bolsonaro’s policies are dangerous not only for Brazil but the '
            'whole world.” The ANPI, an Italian anti-fascism organisation, '
            'described the visit and citizenship as “shameful”. Buoso, from '
            'the far-right League party, defended the decision, saying the '
            'move was not a vote on Bolsonaro’s politics but a recognition of '
            'the Italians who had emigrated to Brazil, like Bolsonaro’s '
            'great-grandfather Vittorio, who was 10 when his family emigrated '
            'to Brazil. The Italian press reported that hosting Bolsonaro and '
            'his entourage had cost the town’s council about €10,000 (£8,500). '
            'Later, police used water cannons to disperse 500 protesters who '
            'reportedly tried to break through a security cordon outside the '
            'Basilica of Saint Anthony in Padua, where Bolsonaro travelled to '
            'after Anguillara Veneta. Bolsonaro’s approval ratings have '
            'slumped before his 2022 reelection campaign, in large part '
            'because of the country’s coronavirus death toll, which is the '
            'second highest in the world. Last week, the Brazilian senate '
            'committee formally approved a report calling for prosecutors to '
            'try Bolsonaro on charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting '

{'article': 'On Sunday’s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver delved into the issue '
            'of homelessness in the US, which has been on the rise, '
            'particularly since the upheavals of the pandemic; experts project '
            'that the pandemic recession will increase chronic homelessness by '
            '49% over the next four years, and cause twice the homelessness as '
            'the Great Recession.\n'
            'Yet “far too often, stories focusing on homelessness are '
            'presented solely through the lens of how it affects those with '
            'homes, when in reality it is obviously the people without them '
            'who need the real help,” said Oliver. “The story of homelessness '
            'in this country is grounded in a failure of perception compounded '
            'by failures of policy,” he continued. That policy, at least in '
            'its modern context, dates back to Ronald Reagan, who “came to '
            'power at a time when homelessness was increasing, and made the '
            'problem far worse by cutting programs for the poor and slashing '
            'housing subsidies by 75%”, and once lamented in a 1984 interview '
            '“the homeless who are homeless, you might say, by choice”.\n'
            '“That notion that homelessness isn’t related to economic policy, '
            'but simply reflects the problems of the individuals experiencing '
            'it, still informs the way it’s discussed today,” Oliver said. '
            'There are, he continued, numerous reasons why someone might be '
            'without housing: medical debt, job loss, fleeing domestic '
            'violence, kicked out of their homes for their sexuality, being '
            'recently released from prison, or just because housing costs are '
            'rising much faster than wages. Given that 70% of low-income '
            'families are spending half their income on rent, and only 37 '
            'affordable and available homes exist for every 100 extremely '
            'low-income renter households, “it doesn’t take much for people to '
            'suddenly find themselves without stable housing,” said Oliver. '
            'Yet focus tends to be on homelessness’s impact on housed '
            'residents; Oliver pointed to numerous stories about human feces '
            'next to homeless encampments in Los Angeles, a city which before '
            'the pandemic had only 16 mobile toilet stations, hauled away at '
            'night, for its 36,000 homeless residents. “So the next time you '
            'complain about human shit in the street, maybe think about what '
            'it would be like if someone padlocked your bathroom every night,” '
            'Oliver said. “You too would suddenly be getting really creative '
            'really fast.” The lack of public restrooms in many cities is one '
            'symptom of what Oliver explained as “the impulse behind many '
            'local policies surrounding unhoused people” – not to help them, '
            'but “to punish them for their existence and keep them out of '
            'sight”, such as hostile architecture designed to keep people from '
            'sitting or lying down, or in the case of one Florida city, '
            'blasting the children’s song “Raining Tacos” to prevent homeless '
            'people from sleeping at a pavilion at night. In addition, local '
            'ordinances that criminalize the behavior of homeless people – '
            'panhandling, sitting down on public or private property – have '
            'landed many unhoused people in a cycle of incarceration. “You '
            'cannot arrest someone out of homelessness in the same way you '
            'can’t sing someone out of bankruptcy,” Oliver argued. “One thing '
            'doesn’t remotely lead to the other, and you’re just going to end '
            'up making things worse.” As for solutions, Oliver had a '
            'straightforward answer: give unhoused people homes. “Some will '
            'say sure, giving the homeless homes is an obvious solution, but '
            'before that they need to be sober and have a job, but it’s just '
            'not that simple,” he explained. “Set aside that dealing with '
            'sobriety or your mental health issues is hard enough when you are '
            'not living on the streets, getting a job is often if not '
            'contingent on, at least aided by having an address.” Which is why '
            'advocates support an approach called housing first, which '
            'prioritizes getting people a place to live along with services '
            'such as mental health care, counseling and job training. Such a '
            'program led the number of homeless veterans to drop from 74,000 '
            'in 2010 to 38,000 in 2018.\n'
            'Supportive housing programs are expensive, he argued, but not as '
            'expensive as current approaches to homelessness, such as '
            'incarceration. “If your primary argument against housing for the '
            'homeless was purely monetary, congratulations, your concerns have '
            'been answered. Also, a pre-congratulations for being visited by '
            'three ghosts this upcoming Christmas Eve.” But funding is not the '
            'only problem – another obstacle to supportive housing programs is '
            'the nimby problem – Not In My Backyard, when residents support a '
            'program in theory, just not in practice when it’s near their '
            'home. Oliver derided nimbyism as unhelpful self-absorption – “it '
            'is not the housed’s comfort that needs to be prioritized right '
            'now. So if you’re wondering why homelessness continues to get '
            'worse in this country, one reason is that there are a lot of '
            'people, even liberals, who believe that homelessness is a '
            'personal failing, poverty can be avoided and their own good '
            'fortune makes them not only better than the unhoused, but more '
            'worthy of comfort. It is basically Reagan’s attitude from a Whole '
            'Foods crowd.” Oliver said he didn’t want to oversimplify the '
            'logistics, as “it will take a massive commitment in '
            'infrastructure, funding and resources. But the very first step '
            'here is a collective change of perceptions. “Basically, we need '
            'to stop being dicks and assuming that the unhoused are a '
            'collection of drug addict criminals who’ve chosen this life for '
            'themselves,” he concluded, “instead of people suffering the '
            'inevitable consequences of gutted social programs and a '
            'nationwide divestment from affordable housing.”',

            'vocals to thrilling effect, packing all this and more into a '

            'Rule. In keeping with the spirit of the evening – part of a tour '

            'latter’s prominent string section, but their audience is more '
            'than happy to follow Neil’s lead and sing the parts themselves. '
            'Biffy Clyro are no longer the dissonant, post-hardcore outfit '

{'article': 'Jersey has issued another 49 licences to French boats in an '
            'apparent attempt to de-escalate a post-Brexit row over fishing '
            'rights in which the UK and France have issued tit-for-tat '
            'threats. The Jersey government said it was allowing another round '
            'of temporary licences until the end of January to allow time for '
            'new arrangements to be put in place, as the two sides prepared to '
            'meet to try to resolve the row. The European Commission has said '
            'officials from France, Britain, Jersey, Guernsey and the '
            'commission will meet on Monday afternoon in Brussels. A '
            'spokesperson said the meeting, which was called by the '
            'commission, aimed for “a swift solution on the outstanding '
            'issues”. Earlier the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, warned '
            'France it had 48 hours to back down on threats made in the row '
            'over fishing licences or Britain would begin dispute talks set '
            'out in the Brexit deal. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, '
            'has previously issued the UK with a deadline of Tuesday to make a '
            'move to allow more French boats access to fishing waters. In a '
            'post-G20 press conference, Macron said Britain must give ground '
            'or France would trigger threatened trade reprisals this week. '
            '“The ball is in Britain’s court. If the British make no movement, '
            'the measures of 2 November will have to be put in place,” he '
            'said. French officials have said they will bar UK fishing boats '
            'from some ports and tighten customs checks on lorries entering '
            'the country unless more licences are granted for their small '
            'boats to fish in Britain’s waters. The diplomatic row over '
            'fishing, a very small sector of the economy, threatened to '
            'overshadow the G20 talks in Rome at the weekend and Cop26 in '
            'Glasgow this week. Jersey said the move would take the number of '
            'licences issued to French vessels to 162. Its government said it '
            'remained open to receiving further data for vessels that had no '
            'licence, and new applications could be submitted at any time. It '
            'is still unclear whether the extra licences will have any effect '
            'on the row. Speaking to AFP on Monday, Macron reiterated that '
            'reprisals “will take effect at midnight tonight” if the two sides '
            'failed to achieve a breakthrough. Almost 1,700 EU vessels have '
            'been licensed to fish in UK waters, equating to 98% of EU '
            'applications for fishing licences, the UK government says, but '
            'this figure is disputed in Paris. Truss suggested on Monday that '
            'Macron may be making “unreasonable threats” because he has a '
            'difficult election looming. Asked about whether France and the UK '
            'had come to an agreement, Truss told Sky News: “The deal hasn’t '
            'been done. The French have made completely unreasonable threats, '
            'including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry and '
            'they need to withdraw those threats.” She said that if the French '
            'did not withdraw the threats, the UK government would use “the '
            'mechanisms of our trade agreement with the EU to take action”, '
            'which “could lead to taking direct action in trade”. Truss said: '
            '“The French have behaved unfairly. It’s not within the terms of '
            'the trade deal. And if someone behaves unfairly in a trade deal '
            'you’re entitled to take action against them and seek some '
            'compensatory measures and that is what we will do if the French '
            'don’t back down. “[The French must] stop threatening UK fishing '
            'vessels, stop threatening the Channel ports, and accept that we '
            'are entirely within our rights to allocate the fishing licences '
            'in line with the trade agreement, as we have done.” She said she '
            'would “absolutely” take legal action in the coming days if France '
            'did not back down, adding: “This issue needs to be resolved in '
            'the next 48 hours.” Asked why the row had emerged, Truss said: '
            '“You might say there’s a French election coming up.” Truss seemed '
            'angered by the dispute and said: “I’m not remotely happy about '
            'what has happened.” Pierre-Henri Dumont, a French politician for '
            'Les Républicains party, said France simply wanted the UK to '
            '“fulfil its commitments that were made during the post-Brexit '
            'treaty”. He said he thought “harder negotiations” may need to be '
            'opened up with the British side. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today '
            'programme: “What we are asking is just for the British government '
            'to fulfil and keep its promises that were made by signing this '
            'post-Brexit agreement. We’re not asking any more. We’re not '
            'asking for something that was not into this treaty. We’re just '
            'asking for the British government to fulfil and to keep its '
            'signature. That’s it.”',

{'article': 'As Boris Johnson stumbles from cliche to cliche in Glasgow, a '
            'boatload of French fishers are making a fool of him. Posing as a '
            'world leader, he pleads that the Earth is “at one minute to '

            'Yet he cannot stop France’s Emmanuel Macron taunting him over a '
            'few boat licences, any more than he can handle the consequences '
            'of the Northern Irish protocol, or exert influence over the truce '
            'between the European Union and the United States on steel '
            'tariffs. Being outside the EU was meant to display Britain '
            'beating its chest across the Channel and round the world, raking '
            'in lucrative new trade. Instead at Cop26, China, Russia and India '
            'have all found better things to do than listen to Johnson’s tired '
            'metaphors amid piles of rain-soaked rubbish. The fishing dispute '
            'with France is complex and unimportant, and 55% of England’s '
            'fishing quota is already owned by EU vessels. The row is pure '
            'electioneering by Emmanuel Macron. But Britain has no friends in '
            'Europe and zero leverage, following the sloppy withdrawal deal '
            'reached by Johnson’s belligerent chief negotiator and crony, '
            'David Frost. He has now handed Macron an election weapon, a '
            'threat to impede all trade through Channel ports. This should be '
            'an outrage.\n'
            'The same sloppiness was evident in last year’s Northern Irish '
            'protocol, which was certain to infuriate Unionists when they '
            'realised Johnson had lied to them over its implications. Now, '
            'when the EU offers Britain a genuine compromise package, as it '
            'did last month, he must pretend to hang tough over the '
            'near-trivial issue of the European court of justice, reneging on '
            'an agreement he personally signed. This too is outrageous. But it '
            'is what happens when politics strays into trade, which was '
            'precisely Johnson’s doing. To rub home the point, Joe Biden has '
            'now signed a deal on steel export tariffs with the EU that '
            'naturally excludes Britain. This is allegedly to make up for the '
            'exclusion of France from the bizarre Anglo-American arms deal '
            'with Australia against China. Johnson may now plead for his own '
            'steel agreement, but he is weakened outside the EU, and American '
            'lobbyists may oppose this. The UK’s decision to leave the EU was '
            'political. So be it. Quite different was the decision also to '
            'leave the European single market and free trade area, which was '
            'the personal choice of Johnson to aid his campaign against '
            'Theresa May. It was ill-considered and foolish. The price is now '
            'being paid by pig farmers and fruit growers, healthcare managers, '
            'transport sector recruiters, builders, hoteliers, musicians and '
            'Ulster unionists. Hardly a single gain has accrued to leaving the '
            'European market. Meanwhile, a widening 10-point gap exists '
            'between those who think Brexit a bad deal for the country against '
            'those who still think it good. Every woe currently descending on '
            'Johnson’s head is attributable not to Brexit but to the loss of '
            'the single market and customs union. It is blatantly in Britain’s '
            'interest to rejoin them. Continental agreements and supply chains '
            'forged more than 20 years of close relations with neighbours are '
            'not matters of great principle. They are a common interest and '
            'common sense. Abandoning them was a massive error in the name of '
            'a spurious freedom. The only question is, who has the guts to '

{'article': 'Armed and masked men hijacked and set fire to a double-decker bus '
            'at dawn on Monday, fuelling fears of a fresh wave of '
            'Brexit-related violence in Northern Ireland. The charred and '
            'smouldering remains of the vehicle remained in the Newtownards '
            'area on Monday afternoon. BBC Northern Ireland reported claims '
            'from loyalists that they had carried out the attack to mark the '
            'passing of the 1 November deadline set by the DUP for walking out '
            'of the Stormont executive unless major changes to the Northern '
            'Ireland protocol had been secured. Stormont’s infrastructure '
            'minister, Nichola Mallon, said two masked men “muttered something '
            'about the protocol” as they held the driver at gunpoint. “Two '
            'masked men entered the bus. They held the driver, a male, at '
            'gunpoint, they said something about the protocol, and they then '
            'proceeded to spray the inside of the bus with flammable liquid. '
            'They forced the bus driver off the bus and then they set it '
            'alight,” Mallon told BBC Radio Ulster’s The Nolan Show. The '
            'driver managed to get off the vehicle unharmed but was badly '
            'shaken by the incident, the police said. No passengers were on '
            'the bus at the time. The attack, which has echoes of the violence '
            'that spilled on to the streets in Belfast and Derry at Easter, '
            'was roundly condemned by all parties including the DUP, which '
            'said “thuggery and terrorism will do nothing to remove the NI '
            'protocol”. The party’s leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said political '
            'engagement had already secured progress in relation to changes to '
            'the protocol and the talks between the EU and the UK must be '
            'allowed take their course. He said when he had set out his '
            'timeline for progress, “the EU was saying that fresh negotiations '
            'were impossible”. But in an indication that Donaldson has parked '
            'his threat to walk out of Stormont, he said that since then fresh '
            'proposals had been put forward by the EU and “serious '
            'negotiations have reopened with the UK government”. “No '
            'reasonable person could deny that this represents significant and '
            'positive progress. That progress was secured through political '
            'action and not violence.” “Those engaging in thuggery only '
            'undermine these efforts and cement the protocol more firmly in '
            'place,” he said. The Ulster Unionist leader, Doug Beattie, '
            'described the attack as “utterly disgraceful, depressing and '
            'stupid” while the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise '
            'Haigh, said it was “utterly reprehensible”.',

            'are going unheard at this climate summit,” he said. “Either '
            'because they were blocked from attending by vaccine or economic '

            'since the poorly prepared Copenhagen conference in 2009 according '
            'to the Guardian’s environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey. She '

            '8am to get here, so there’s a lot of weariness in the crowd here '
            'before we even get started but everyone is still in good spirits '
            'and just eager to get in.” Protesters were gathering too. Despite '

            'producer on a handful of recent projects before stepping into a '
            'co-director role on this film, adds that Attica was resonating '
            'with the reality outside her own Brooklyn apartment while they '
            'were making the film in 2020. “It really crystallized what this '
            'film was all about, watching George Floyd protests happening '
            'outside my window,” says Curry. She talks about witnessing police '
            'descending on protesters from her apartment. She compares Donald '
            'Trump’s attack on peaceful protesters near the White House to '
            'York governor Nelson Rockefeller’s political opportunism while '
            'handling Attica. She compares the disregard for life and humanity '
            'in Attica to the early days of the pandemic in US prisons, where '
            'Covid-19 outbreaks ravage the incarcerated population. “Attica is '
            'an invitation for us to reconsider a lot of what we’re willing to '
            'allow the state to do in our name today.” Attica, the film, also '
            'feels like a continuation and cumulation of the documentaries '
            'Nelson has been making for more than three decades. Whether '
            'directing on his own or collaborating with others, Nelson has '
            'been building a tapestry that captures so many vital stories in '
            'African American history and daily life.\n'
            '“I would feel very strongly that people should make films about '
            'the communities that they’re from and something that they know '
            'about and get into in a deeper way,” says Nelson, who was 20 when '
            'Attica happened. “I remember the utter shock and devastation when '
            'it ended up the way it ended up.” Nelson is speaking from his '
            'office in Harlem, with the multiple Emmy and Peabody awards he '
            'accumulated over the years strategically framed around him. I can '
            'also spy the National Medal in the Humanities he received from '
            'Barack Obama way in the back. Nelson’s first film, 1989’s Two '
            'Dollars and A Dream, was a biography on cosmetics entrepreneur '
            'Madame CJ Walker, the first female self-made millionaire. That '
            'story bears a family connection to the film-maker. Nelson’s '
            'grandfather FB Ransom was Walker’s attorney and the general '
            'manager of her enterprise. His mother, A’Lelia Nelson, became the '
            'company’s president for a time. Nelson’s film-making career '
            'essentially began with a story in his DNA before expanding out. '
            'He made biographies on Marcus Garvey and Miles Davis along with '
            'docs that celebrated Black press, activists and colleges. His '
            'most recent film, the Netflix documentary Crack: Cocaine, '
            'Corruption & Conspiracy, covered the institutional failures '
            'behind the crack epidemic that led to the mass incarceration of '
            'so many Black people. Nelson’s films also have a tendency to '
            'speak to each other. His 2014 documentary Freedom Summer, about a '
            '1964 drive to encourage African American voter registration, ends '
            'with civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael yelling “Black '
            'Power!” And his follow-up film, The Black Panthers: Vanguard of '
            'the Revolution, coincidentally begins with the same chant. But '
            'that’s an unintentional consequence of chronicling the '
            'African-American experience throughout a century and stumbling on '
            'echoes and overlaps. These stories simply don’t exist in a '
            'vacuum. “What we have gone through, what we’re going through in '
            'this culture, is all tied up together,” says Nelson. And so it '
            'goes that the stories of institutional failures, passionate '
            'activism and Black self-determination featured in Nelson’s past '
            'work are also elements in Attica, which in many ways feels like a '
            'compelling, all-encompassing microcosm of America.\n'
            'There’s another element to the Attica story that resonates today. '
            'The protests and racial reckoning of the past year happened '
            'because a young woman named Darnella Frazier stood by and '
            'recorded George Floyd’s murder. Her act of witnessing mobilized '
            'the country. The cameras served a similar function at Attica. The '
            'inmates, Nelson reminds, called the media and their TV cameras '
            'into the prison. They did that so the nation could hear them '
            'speak their truth and the cameras can serve as witness. “They '
            'thought that if the news media came in and filmed it, they would '
            'be protected,” says Nelson, “and thank God they did.” His '
            'documentary is built from all that visceral, on-the-ground '
            'footage from fifty-years ago, continuing the act of witnessing '
            'the inmates pushed for back then. “It makes us able to tell the '
            'story of Attica in a way that we can’t in any other prison '
            'uprising in this country. We could tell the story of Attica when '
            'we could see it.” Attica is now out in US cinemas and will air on '
            'Showtime on 6 November with a UK date to be announced',

{'article': 'Sir David Attenborough has called on leaders at the Cop26 summit '
            'in Glasgow to be “motivated by hope rather than fear” to avoid '
            'climate catastrophe. Speaking in front of an audience that '
            'included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference’s opening '
            'ceremony on Monday afternoon, the broadcaster and naturalist said '
            'humanity was “already in trouble”. He also appealed to the '
            'political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week '
            'summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to 1.5C '
            'above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in '
            'the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Attenborough said: “Everything '
            'we have achieved in the last 10,000 years has been enabled '
            'because of the [climate] stability during this time. “The global '
            'temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either '
            'plus or minus one degree celsius – until now.”\n'
            'He continued: “We are already in trouble. The stability we all '
            'depend on is breaking. “This story is one of inequality as well '
            'as instability. Today those who have done the least to cause this '
            'problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us '
            'will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable. “Is this how '
            'our story is due to end? A tale of the smartest species doomed by '
            'that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger '
            'picture in pursuit of short-term goals?” He added his voice to '
            'increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a '
            'commitment to the 1.5C temperature limit and called on young '
            'people to “rewrite our story”. “Perhaps the fact that the people '
            'most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined '
            'future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will '
            'give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story,” he said.\n'
            '“To turn this tragedy into a triumph – we are after all the '
            'greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. “We now '
            'understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising '
            'and put it in reverse. “We must recapture billions of tonnes of '
            'carbon from the air, we must fix our sights on keeping 1.5 '
            'degrees within reach.” Attenborough also highlighted the fact '
            'that “no nation has completed its development because no advanced '
            'nation is yet sustainable”, and demanded “all nations have a good '
            'standard of living and a modest footprint”. He concluded: “It '
            'comes down to this. The people alive now and the generation to '
            'come will look at this conference and consider one thing – did '
            'the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of '
            'commitments made here? “There’s every reason to believe that the '
            'answer can be yes. If working apart we are forces powerful enough '
            'to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are '
            'powerful enough to save it.” He added: “That desperate hope … is '
            'why the world is looking to you and why you are here.”',

            'following the full rules around self-isolation after a positive '
            'Covid test, according to a survey that suggests compliance with '
            'the requirements has slipped since the summer. The latest figures '
            'from the Office for National Statistics, based on a survey of 881 '
            'people in England in late September and early October, show that '
            'only 75% of respondents aged 35 to 54 complied with the full '
            'rules around self-isolation for the 10 days after testing '
            'positive for coronavirus. The number is down substantially from '
            'the 86% compliance reported by the ONS in July, and suggests that '
            'those in their mid-30s to mid-50s are now the least able, or '
            'least likely, of any age group to abide by the full requirements '
            'of self-isolation after a positive result.\n'
            'Hints of lower compliance were also seen in older people, with '
            'adherence to self-isolation falling marginally in those aged 55 '
            'and over from 81% in the summer to 78% in recent weeks, according '
            'to the ONS survey. Evidence for an opposing trend was seen in '
            'younger people, with 82% of 18- to 34-year-olds reporting full '
            'compliance with self-isolation rules in the latest survey, up '
            'from 75% in the summer. The findings came as further ONS data '
            'gathered between January and September 2021 showed that '
            'unvaccinated people were 32 times more likely to die from Covid '
            'than fully vaccinated individuals. The latest round of the ONS '
            'self-isolation survey collected responses from adults in England '
            'between 27 September and 2 October. The ONS said the statistics '
            'were “experimental” and based on a small number of respondents '
            'who reported their own behaviour, so should be treated with '
            'caution. Overall, the ONS estimates that 78% of individuals who '
            'have a positive Covid test follow the full requirements for '
            'self-isolation, a similar rate to the 79% seen in the previous '
            'round of the survey in July. However, the ONS said the compliance '
            'rate was “significantly lower” than levels seen earlier in the '
            'year, such as 84% in April and 86% in May. About one-third (34%) '
            'of those who tested positive for Covid reported that isolating '
            'had a negative effect on their mental health, down from 42% in '
            'July. “Today’s results highlight the majority of those testing '
            'positive for Covid-19 adhere to self-isolation requirements, '
            'though there has been a decrease since April and May earlier this '
            'year,” said Tim Gibbs, head of the ONS public services analysis '
            'team. “As we continue into the winter months, it is important we '
            'monitor general adherence to self-isolation requirements, which '

{'article': 'Shares in the cybersecurity firm Darktrace have plummeted again '
            'after an analyst note raising doubts about its valuation and as '
            'the expiry looms of a lock-up on insiders selling their stakes. '
            'The Cambridge-based firm, which had been a star performer since '
            'floating in April and joining the FTSE 100 last week, closed down '
            '121p at 698p on Monday, a fall of more than 15% that valued the '
            'company at £4.7bn. Its shares first began to dive last week after '
            'an analyst note from Peel Hunt questioned its sky-high valuation. '
            'The note raised a range of issues, including that some customers '
            'of Darktrace, which uses artificial intelligence to create '
            'digital security products to keep businesses one step ahead of '
            'hackers and viruses, had described its technology as “snake oil”. '
            'The company, which is run by its 39-year old co-founder Poppy '
            'Gustafsson, has lost about £2bn from its market capitalisation '
            'within a week. Last month, Gustafsson, a high profile female '
            'executive in the male-dominated tech scene, took part in a '
            'government event promoting investment in Britain held at Windsor '
            'Castle where she was pictured meeting the Queen. The company’s '
            'shares had come close to hitting 1,000p in recent weeks, valuing '
            'the business at nearly £7bn, quadruple the 250p it began trading '
            'at when it made its debut on the London Stock Exchange. '
            'Darktrace’s latest share price fall – the largest in the FTSE 100 '
            '– comes as a 180-day lock on investors who were onboard at the '
            'flotation selling their shares ends on Wednesday. Investors who '
            'could offload stakes include the British tech billionaire Mike '
            'Lynch, Darktrace’s first and largest shareholder pre-float, who '
            'sold the software group Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard for £8.4bn in '
            '2011.\n'
            'Lynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, own a 16.2% stake in '
            'Darktrace, worth about £780m, and are its second-largest '
            'shareholders. Lynch is appealing against his extradition to the '
            'US, where he is accused of fraudulently inflating the value of '
            'Autonomy before its sale to HP, and also awaits judgment in a '
            '$5bn civil fraud trial brought by HP. He denies any wrongdoing in '
            'either case. Last Monday, two days before Darktrace replaced '
            'Morrisons in the FTSE 100 after the acquisition of the '
            'supermarket chain by the US private equity group CD&R, an analyst '
            'note titled Reality Check by the city brokers Peel Hunt wiped '
            'more than a fifth of the company’s market cap. The note warned '
            'that there was a “disconnect” between the company’s valuation and '
            'its growth prospects. “While we believe strong growth rates will '
            'continue, we also see a disconnect between valuation and the '
            'ultimate revenue opportunity,” the note said. “Having considered '
            'the potential market size, the intensifying competition, and '
            'Darktrace’s limited [research and development] spend, we take a '
            'more grounded approach to our valuation, giving a target price of '
            '473p.” Darktrace joins a string of companies that initially '
            'enjoyed a pandemic boom – including fashion businesses Asos, '
            'Boohoo and The Hut Group, as well as grocery delivery business '
            'Ocado and spread-betting firm CMC Markets – to lose their shine '
            'among investors in recent months. Darktrace, which has almost '
            '6,000 customers, said revenues grew 50.8% year-on-year in the '
            'quarter to the end of September, significantly slower than the '
            'almost quadrupling in share price the company had enjoyed until '
            'last week. “Darktrace uses cutting-edge AI technology to protect '
            'almost 6,000 customers worldwide, of which 1,500 signed up in the '

{'article': 'Throughout October, the viola player Antoine Tamestit was the '
            'London Symphony Orchestra’s artist-in-focus. After performances '
            'of concertos by Walton and Martinů, he closed his residency with '
            'the London premiere of the concerto written for him by Jörg '
            'Widmann. Tamestit gave the first performance in 2015, and he has '
            'since played it some 20 times, very often with Daniel Harding, '
            'who was conducting here too. Widmann’s viola concerto is a '
            'substantial piece – a single movement lasting half an hour. It '
            'proceeds in picaresque fashion through a series of musical '
            'encounters between the soloist and members of the orchestra, '
            'during which he moves around the platform, confronting different '
            'instruments in turn. It’s an idea that Thea Musgrave used more '
            'than half a century ago in her clarinet concerto, but Widmann was '
            'inspired by Tamestit himself, who has performed Berlioz’s Harold '
            'in Italy with similar peregrinations.\n'
            'But it begins with the soloist alone at the side of the stage, '
            'gently tapping on the body of his instrument, gradually drawing '
            'members of the orchestra into the argument. It’s a while before '
            'Widmann allows Tamestit to reveal the gorgeous smoky sound that '
            'he can draw from his Stradivarius. The viola’s subsequent '
            'adventures are undeniably vivid – there are brief flirtations '
            'with the harp and bass flute, a fierce encounter with the tuba, a '
            'violent outburst from the whole orchestra provoking frantic solo '
            'activity, before the wispy, quietly evaporating coda. But though '
            'they do make a fine showcase for Tamestit’s outstanding '
            'virtuosity, they seem to be a series of self-contained, '
            'brilliantly conceived moments, rather than adding up to something '
            'more than the sum of their parts. After the concerto came two '
            'programmatic works by Dvořák – the concert overture In Nature’s '
            'Realm, and what is perhaps the best known of the five symphonic '

{'article': 'The health secretary is facing legal action over the Immensa '
            'testing fiasco, in which about 43,000 people have been given '
            'false negative Covid results since September. The Good Law '
            'Project has sent a pre-action letter to Sajid Javid seeking '
            'answers over the scandal, which some experts believe has '
            'contributed to a rise in coronavirus cases in south-west England. '
            'The project, led by Jo Maugham QC, said it was asking the health '
            'secretary and UK Health Security Agency to terminate Immensa’s '
            'contracts immediately, compensate the individuals affected and '
            'take action to properly regulate private testing firms. It says '
            'it will sue if its requests are not met, arguing there have been '
            'breaches of public law duties and the Human Rights Act. The '
            'letter says: “The false negatives and the defendants’ unlawful '
            'failure to adequately monitor and regulate Immensa’s performance '
            'have exposed the affected individuals, their families and '
            'communities to grave risks and in many cases harm.” Downing '
            'Street has denied claims that the false Covid test results from '
            'the Wolverhampton lab were to blame for a sharp rise in cases in '
            'south-west England, saying the region may have been catching up '
            'with the rest of the country. Immensa was founded in May 2020 by '
            'Andrea Riposati, a former management consultant and owner of a '
            'DNA testing company. Three months later, the Department of Health '
            'awarded it a £119m PCR testing contract. Riposati is the firm’s '
            'sole listed owner and board director. The award of the contract '
            'in autumn 2020 bypassed the normal competitive procedures, which '
            'the government said was necessary because of the urgency of the '
            'need for testing during the pandemic. Immensa was subsequently '
            'given a further £50m testing contract in August 2021. The '
            'Guardian has learned that Immensa won a separate £12m contract in '
            'relation to genomic sequencing as recently as September this '
            'year, raising questions over whether this would have happened if '
            'the problems regarding the Wolverhampton lab had been spotted '
            'sooner. Since the scandal broke it has emerged that Immensa was '
            'not fully accredited with the UK Accreditation Service. It was '
            'already the subject of an investigation into its sister company, '
            'Dante Labs, by the Competition and Markets Authority into its '
            'travel tests. Riposati is also the founder of Dante Labs. The '
            'Department of Health promised to look into behaviour at the '
            'Wolverhampton lab after a Sun on Sunday report about workers '
            'there allegedly fighting, sleeping, playing football and drinking '
            'on duty. The government said at the time it would speak to '
            'Immensa as it took “evidence of misconduct extremely seriously”. '
            'The Guardian also found that Dante Labs in the US had sent out '
            'used DNA test kits filled with other customers’ saliva. After the '
            'incident in 2018, Dante Labs issued a statement saying five '
            'people received “used kits” as a result of an error by its '
            'shipping provider, with Riposati saying he took “full '
            'responsibility”. Maugham said: “We don’t know why government '
            'chose to sidestep established testing facilities in universities '
            'and hospitals to send £119m to a newly formed private company. '
            'But the consequences have been catastrophic. Many people are '
            'likely to have lost their lives. We want answers for their '
            'families and the tens of thousands of others whose lives have '
            'been blighted by the government’s inexplicable disregard for '
            'public health.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The '
            'Immensa laboratory in Wolverhampton passed an independent quality '
            'audit overseen by NHS Test and Trace and is in the process of '
            'UKAS accreditation.” Separately, the Good Law Project has '
            'previously forced disclosures from the government about VIP '
            'access for favoured companies during the pandemic. Its legal '
            'proceedings also revealed that Lord Bethell, then a health '
            'minister, replaced his phone before it could be examined for '
            'information relevant to £85m of deals that are subject to a legal '
            'challenge. Government lawyers said Bethell had not been issued '
            'with a “preservation notice” requiring him to save documents '
            'because ministers’ official correspondence was routinely saved as '
            'a matter of course. However, this did not cover government '
            'business conducted by private means. Bethell, who oversaw the '
            'award of Covid contracts and is no longer a minister, is one of '
            'those under scrutiny over the way deals for personal protective '
            'equipment (PPE) and tests were awarded at the height of the '
            'pandemic.',

{'article': 'The global death toll from Covid-19 has passed 5 million, 19 '
            'months after the pandemic was first declared, according to '
            'figures released by Johns Hopkins University. Some experts, '
            'including those from the World Health Organization, believe the '
            'true toll may be two to three times higher than official figures '
            'suggest. The number of deaths from Covid-19 far outstrip that of '
            'other viral epidemics in the 21st century and most from the 20th '
            'century, with the notable exception of the Spanish flu. The US, '
            'Brazil, India, Mexico and the UK together account for more than '
            'half of all deaths worldwide. In the last 28 days, Johns Hopkins '
            'University has logged 197,116 deaths and 11.7 million new cases '
            'around the world. After it was first recorded in China in late '
            '2019, the coronavirus spread quickly to almost every corner of '
            'the world and the outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020. '
            'In the last month, the US, UK, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine have '
            'recorded the most new cases, while 581m doses of vaccine have '
            'been administered worldwide. The US has the largest death toll, '
            'at 745,836, followed by India (458,437). Russia’s official death '
            'toll stands at 235,318, although independent analysis of excess '
            'deaths in Russia by the Moscow Times suggests the true figure '
            'could be up to three times higher. UK government figures show '
            'that in the last seven days there were 284,058 new cases, numbers '
            'last seen in the January and July peaks of the virus in the UK. '
            'In the last week 1,099 people have died in the UK within 28 days '
            'of a positive test, taking the total official death toll to '
            '163,515. Nearly 80% of the population aged 12 and above in the UK '
            'have received two doses of a vaccine, and 86.9% have had at least '
            'one. Ariel Karlinsky, a member of the World Health Organization’s '
            'technical advisory group on Covid mortality, said the 5 million '
            'milestone was actually passed “a long time ago”. He estimated the '
            'the true global death toll from the pandemic so far was “at least '
            '10 million people”. “There are 5 million covid deaths just in '
            'India,” he estimated in an interview with the Guardian. Karlinsky '
            'said the most reliable indicator was excess death toll, which was '
            'typically 40% higher, according to data. But he said certain '
            'countries were statistical “black holes”. These included India, '
            'Pakistan and many countries in Africa. Belarus and Nicaragua had '
            'dramatically undercounted Covid-related deaths, while in Egypt '
            'excess mortality was 13 times higher than official figures, he '
            'said. There was a correlation between good governance and good '
            'data, he added. He said in Russia more than 872,000 people had '
            'died of Covid, according to his estimate on Monday, over three '
            'times the Kremlin’s figure. “Autocrats tend to manipulate data. '
            'In Moscow, it is much worse than reported. The numbers from '
            'Belarus are complete nonsense,” Karlinsky said. Dr Albert Ko, a '
            'specialist in infectious diseases at the Yale School of Public '
            'Health, said: “This is a defining moment in our lifetime. What do '
            'we have to do to protect ourselves so we don’t get to another 5 '
            'million?” The death toll as tallied by Johns Hopkins rivals the '
            'number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, '
            'according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. '
            'Globally, Covid-19 is the third leading cause of death, after '
            'heart disease and stroke. Hotspots for the virus have shifted '
            'over the course of the pandemic, with eastern European countries '
            'experiencing a surge amid low vaccination rates, while some '
            'places such as Thailand reopen to tourism.\n'
            'Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, the director of ICAP, a global health centre at '
            'Columbia University in the US, told the Associated Press: “What’s '
            'uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the '
            'high-resource countries. That’s the irony of Covid-19.” Wealthier '
            'nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of '
            'older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of '
            'whom are especially vulnerable to Covid-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer '
            'countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young '
            'adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from Covid. The '
            'Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracking dashboard has '
            'become regarded as one of the most reliable measures of the '
            'spread of the disease globally, as it is independent and run by a '
            'small team of disease modelling experts at the University in '
            'Baltimore. The dashboard project began in January 2020, initially '
            'with manual data entry, and it is now automated and scrapes Covid '
            'data from official government sources around the world, with a '
            'team of about a dozen people managing it. Associated Press '

{'article': 'An unusual event marking what organizers called “the start of the '
            'produce season” was recently held on the US side of an '
            'international port of entry connecting Mexico with Pharr, Texas. '
            'It was a different kind of ribbon-cutting ceremony, in front of a '
            'crowd of hundreds gathered beneath a large tent leading to the '
            'bridge connecting the United States and Mexico. Local dignitaries '
            'from both sides of the border were given a fruit or vegetable '
            'imported from Mexico and asked to cut it, which they dutifully '
            'did to the delight of the crowd. Then came the free-for-all. The '
            'crowd was given bags and told to take what they wanted from a '
            'carefully staged backdrop of every type of fruit and vegetable '
            'that comes through this region. While this quaint tradition has '
            'been a mainstay of the region for years, this year may make the '
            'event more significant, asthe United States struggles with supply '
            'chain problems in the wake of the pandemic.\n'
            'That’s because the produce-importing capacity of this landlocked '
            'port of entry could provide a solution that would help alleviate '
            'the problems that have been created by the backlog of ships '
            'waiting to offload cargo at the ports of Los Angeles and Long '
            'Beach, which account for 40% of all shipping containers entering '
            'the US. When President Biden recently announced that the Los '
            'Angeles port would stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to '
            'alleviate the backlog, a total of 64 ships were berthed at the '
            'two ports and an additional 80 were parked in the Pacific waiting '
            'their turn to unload. Experts are already predicting a Christmas '
            'shortage of certain goods, particularly those coming from Asia. '
            'What does Mexican produce coming through a landlocked south Texas '
            'port have to do with this backlog? It may be the key to '
            'developing a new trade route that avoids California and uses '
            'Mexican ports to get into the US via south Texas. It may even '
            'show the potential for a new mode of transportation that could '
            'alleviate growing traffic problems on our nation’s highways. The '
            'key is the newly remodeled Mexican Federal Highway 40, or the '
            'Carretera Interoceánica (Interoceanic Highway). This is a road '
            'that runs from near the Port of Mazatlán on the Pacific coast to '
            'Reynosa, Mexico, just across the border from several cities in '
            'south Texas and is connected by several ports of entry, including '
            'the Pharr International Bridge. The 1,145 km route bisects the '
            'northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains by way of '
            '63 tunnels and 115 bridges, including the Baluarte Bridge, the '
            'highest suspension bridge in the world. And the highway provides '
            'direct access from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. '
            'Recent improvements to this roadway have dropped the drive time '
            'across Mexico to three hours from eight. Produce grown near the '
            'Pacific coast of Mexico had once been transported north for '
            'import into the United States through California. But the opening '
            'of the remodeled Mexican highway, particularly in the mountain '
            'region, gave growers a new option – a route through Texas. Pharr, '
            'in south Texas, now boasts that it is the busiest importer of '
            'Mexican produce in the United States and is a conduit for more '
            'than $33bn in trade with Mexico in 2020. This includes $21bn '
            'worth of imports and $11bn in exports. The Pharr bridge ranks '
            'number one for avocados, shipping nearly 50% and more than $1bn '
            'of that fruit. It’s number one in pineapple imports; number two '
            'for berries; and number three for tomatoes. As the produce boon '
            'began a few years ago, local realtors began joking that homes in '
            'neighborhoods that had been popular with drug dealers were being '
            'sold to produce importers. This region already has a large '
            'presence of factories called maquiladoras, twin plants that allow '
            'manufacturers to set up a factory on the US side of the border, '
            'transport partially built products to twin plants on the Mexican '
            'side of the border where labor costs are lower, and send back '
            'finished products to the US side at lower tariff rates because of '
            'the manufacturing process here. Reynosa, Mexico, across the '
            'border from Pharr, McAllen and Mission, has more than 200 '
            'manufacturing plants representing 155 companies and employing '
            '100,000 workers. So even the success of produce imports is '
            'dwarfed by product imports from these twin plants such as '
            'televisions and computer monitors, which represent the top import '
            'over the Pharr bridge at double the revenue wrought from '
            'avocados. Some local community leaders are beginning to wonder '
            'aloud if the success of the produce imports can be a model for '
            'other products. Can the flow of goods from Asia to California '
            'take a slightly southern route to the Port of Mazatlán? From '
            'there, the products can be off-loaded and shipped across Mexico '
            'on Highway 40 for import into the United States in south Texas. '
            'Once across the international boundary, shippers have two '
            'options: they can move their products via highway on trucks that '
            'are beginning their US journey through the middle of the country '
            'by way of Texas rather than the far west coast of California. '
            'Larger shipments can be transported 30 minutes east from the '
            'international border to the Port of Brownsville or driven five '
            'hours to the Port of Houston. As supply chain issues continue to '
            'fester in the United States, new concerns are being raised about '
            'disruptions to food products. This brings a sense of urgency to '
            'discussions of new trade routes and raises the profile of import '
            'areas such as Pharr, which has a growing inventory of cold '
            'storage units to temporarily keep produce and other food. There '
            'are even mid-term and long-term possibilities that would make a '
            'new Asia-Mexico-Texas trade route more viable, especially as an '
            'alternative to the west coast port congestion – rail shipments '
            'supplementing truck shipments and an innovative technology that '
            'could make rail and truck traffic seamlessly integrate into a '
            'multi-modal planner’s dream. The Freight Shuttle Xpress is being '
            'designed in conjunction with Texas A&M University’s '
            'Transportation Institute. It integrates what it calls '
            '“electric-powered transporters” capable of holding truck and '
            'shipping containers from one location to another. And in the best '
            'tradition of Walt Disney, these transporters would travel via a '
            'monorail system that could be built into the medians of existing '
            'highways. The approach would save on acquisition costs, including '
            'potential years-long eminent domain court fights for new '
            'right-of-way. It would also alleviate growing traffic problems, '
            'particularly along Texas’s main street, the Interstate 35 '
            'corridor that cuts through the state. A 2016 study said that '
            '2.2bn tons of freight moved through Texas, a figure projected to '
            'go up to 3.8bn tons by the year 2040. The Freight Shuttle Xpress '
            'tried to raise investment funding several years ago to begin a '
            'project emanating from the Port of Houston, but did not raise '
            'enough money. But a route emanating from south Texas has the '
            'allure of attracting Mexican investment at a time when a backlog '
            'of goods due to the pandemic favors new ideas. Carlos Sanchez is '
            'director of public affairs for Hidalgo county, Texas. He was a '

{'article': 'At her independent bookshop in the small, rural town of '
            'Puy-en-Velay in southern France, Anne Helman had seen an influx '
            'of customers since the coronavirus pandemic who said they would '
            'rather buy books in person than online. “I’ve never sold as many '
            'copies of Albert Camus’s The Plague,” she said. “Children wanted '
            'fantasy books. Adults wanted novels and the classics, '
            'particularly stories about viruses and the apocalypse. There has '
            'been a newfound enthusiasm for buying locally and supporting '
            'independent bookshops; it’s seen as the virtuous thing to do.” '
            'The French government is seizing on this increased support for '
            'independent bookshops to pursue its war against the domination of '
            'big tech firms. In a blow to Amazon, new legislation in France is '
            'to set a minimum price for book deliveries, in order to stop what '
            'the government calls “distorted competition” against independent '
            'bookshops from digital giants who deliver books for a charge of '
            'as little as €0.01. The French culture minister, Roselyne '
            'Bachelot, begged the nation during one lockdown: “Do not buy '
            'books from online platforms!” Now the French parliament is '
            'limiting the market advantages of net giants, which it hopes '
            'could set a precedent for other European countries seeking to '
            'protect small bookstores. The minimum delivery fee, which still '
            'has to be decided in negotiations with the state regulator, '
            'should come into force next year.\n'
            'Passing laws to protect books and the book trade is a rare point '
            'of political consensus in France, where debate has otherwise '
            'become increasingly tense in the run-up to next year’s '
            'presidential race. Emmanuel Macron has declared reading “a '
            'national priority”, extending opening hours for libraries. The '
            'move to force net giants to charge the same for delivery as small '
            'bookshops is part of the French notion of “cultural '
            'exceptionalism”, which has long sought to shield books and '
            'independent booksellers from the ravages of free-market forces. '
            'In contrast to the UK’s famous three-for-two deals on novels, the '
            'French state fixes the prices of books and readers pay the same '
            'for a new book whether they buy online, at a high-street giant or '
            'a small bookseller. The law allows for a maximum discount on '
            'books of only 5%. It has helped preserve France’s 3,500 '
            'independent bookshops – more than three times the number in the '
            'UK – which account for 12,000 jobs. But while French law bans '
            'free book deliveries, Amazon and other big companies selling '
            'online have circumvented this by charging just a single centime '
            'for shipping a book. Independent bookshops, to keep their narrow '
            'margins, have to charge much higher post-office prices. “Local '
            'bookstores typically have to charge about €6 [£5] or €7 for '
            'sending a book, so there was a considerable gap,” said Géraldine '
            'Bannier, a centrist MP who presented the law in the lower house '
            'of parliament. “This is about defending the diversity of where '
            'people can buy their books. It is very important to us.” More '
            'than 20% of the 435m books sold in France in 2019 were bought '
            'online. The fate of French independent bookstores during the '
            'pandemic has greatly influenced the new law. France had three '
            'nationwide lockdowns. During the first two, bookshops remained '
            'closed, despite protests from writers and publishers. But during '
            'the second lockdown, in November 2020, the government reimbursed '
            'delivery fees for small independent booksellers. It resulted in '
            'small shops maintaining 70% of their business. “It showed what a '
            'brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,” '
            'said the rightwing senator Laure Darcos who drafted the law. In '
            'the final lockdown this spring, books were deemed essential items '
            'and bookshops stayed open, with historically high numbers of '
            'customers flocking to buy from them. Across France, independent '
            'bookshops saw a year-on-year fall in sales of only 3.3% in 2020 '
            'despite three months of closures. Amazon warned that new '
            'legislation fixing delivery prices would “weigh on the purchasing '
            'power of consumers” and affect readers in small towns and rural '
            'areas. French politicians argued that people who bought books '
            'online tended to live in big cities and urban areas, while '
            'independent bookshops were present in rural areas in France. '
            'Wilfrid Séjeau, the owner of the independent bookshop Le Cyprès '
            'in Nevers, Burgundy, said he had posted about 70 books a day to '
            'customers during France’s second lockdown last year, wrapping '
            'many as gifts. When his shop reopened, there was a marked rise in '
            'customers from the surrounding rural area. “People realised '
            'certain things are precious,” he said of the human link between a '
            'bookseller and customer. “A person might buy a lot of books on '
            'Amazon but also enjoy browsing in small bookshops. People often '
            'save a book into their basket on Amazon as soon as they hear '
            'about it so they don’t forget. Now they tell us: ‘I’m stopping '
            'that, I’ll send you a list or reserve on your site instead.’” His '
            'trade is up and he has created two jobs since the pandemic in the '
            'two independent bookstores he runs on the same street, along with '
            'a stationery shop. Guillaume Husson of the French booksellers’ '
            'union, the Syndicat de la Librairie Française, said the law was '
            'about preserving bookstores as a meeting place in town centres, '
            'but also protecting publishers. “Independent bookstores don’t '
            'sell the same things as other sales points – they have more '
            'first-time novelists, more challenging publications – that has '
            'allowed hundreds of publishers and writers to exist.” Vincent '
            'Chabault, a sociologist at the University of Paris, saw good '
            'sales during the pandemic for his book Éloge du Magasin: Contre '
            'l’Amazonisation (In Praise of Shops: Against Amazonisation). He '
            'said small independent bookshops, which remained fragile, had '
            'become “the symbol of resistance against online platforms and '
            'Amazon” adding: “One thing we’ve learned from the Covid crisis is '
            'that digital capitalism has progressed and there’s a need to '
            'preserve places and moments where we can be together unconnected '
            'and offline.” Back in the Puy-en-Velay bookshop Le Chat Perché, '
            'Helman praised the legislation. She had feared for her shop’s '
            'survival when Covid first hit, but June 2020 to June 2021 proved '
            'to be her most profitable period in 23 years. She worried that '
            'customers had become so used to quick delivery by online giants '
            'that it would be a challenge for them to adapt to a slower pace '
            'of ordering books from independents. “People are used to ordering '
            'something online that pops through the letter box two days later. '
            'That’s the one thing which will still be hard to compete with.”',

{'article': 'There was a nasty surprise for some supporters leaving '
            'Europa-Park Stadion after an uplifting afternoon. Those who '
            'parked on Hermann-Mitsch-Strasse found that theirs was one of '
            'dozens of cars towed by the local authorities as visitors get '
            'used to traffic restrictions at SC Freiburg’s new home. A few '
            'teething problems in the new place, perhaps, are to be expected. '
            'On the pitch, everything is much smoother. A home victory over '
            'struggling Greuther Fürth would be seen as standard in most '
            'contexts. Here, as a first win in only the second game at the new '
            'pad where they’re still peeling the sticky-back plastic off some '
            'of the seats, it meant so much more. “We are already a little bit '
            'in love,” said midfielder Nicolas Höfler, who headed the second '
            'in Saturday’s victory in front of a sell-out crowd of 31,500.\n'
            'Leaving Dreisamstadion had been hard – their iconic coach '
            'Christian Streich wept on the pitch as the squad greeted fans at '
            'the end of the last game there, the 3-0 win over Augsburg in late '
            'September. Maybe it will be even harder as winter bites, with the '
            'trip into -8c in the old chocolate box of a ground in the Black '
            'Forest a rite of passage for the hardiest Bundesliga away teams '
            'in past years. It will be missed. Now, the move delayed by the '
            'pandemic feels as if it has come to pass at just the right time, '
            'with supporters back in the stadiums (even with the new 2G '
            'regulations meaning spectators can only enter after full '
            'vaccination or with a certificate of recovery from Covid, the '
            'Fürth tickets were snapped up in double-quick time) combining '
            'with Freiburg’s excellent start to the season to create a sense '
            'of happening. They begin Monday morning in third place in the '
            'Bundesliga, as its only unbeaten team (or indeed as Germany’s '
            'only domestically unbeaten professional side) with comfortably '
            'the best defensive record in the division. The seven Freiburg '
            'have let in makes them the only team with a single figure in the '
            'concession column. Having equalled the club’s longest ever '
            'top-flight unbeaten run of 10 they could set a new record next '
            'week – if they avoid defeat at Bayern Munich.\n'
            'If any coach could keep the near-euphoria in check it’s Streich, '
            'the Bundesliga’s longest-serving coach, one of its most popular '
            'and without doubt its most down-to-earth. He’ll celebrate a '
            'decade in charge of the first team a few days before the turn of '
            'the year but his association with the club goes back much further '
            '– he’s been on the coaching staff in various guises since 1995 '
            'having previously played a season for the club in the late ‘80s. '
            'His click with Freiburg is as real as it gets. Yet what makes him '
            'so loved in the Bundesliga is that he is more than just a great '
            'coach. He often holds court on wider societal themes in his press '
            'conferences, and emphasises perspective and respect in a game '
            'that can often lose sight of both. “People who care for disabled '
            'people are genuinely worthy of praise,” he told Deutsche Welle in '
            'his first major TV interview, a few months after his appointment. '
            'He also told DW in that interview that he was “trying to remain '
            'seated more”. It’s fair to say that it’s one of the few things '
            'that hasn’t worked for him in the past 10 years. A huge element '
            'of the Streich legend is his touchline demeanour, wired, '
            'passionate and feeling every kick, whilst understanding that '
            'football is just football, the most important of the least '
            'important things in life. Now, Streich takes that attitude and '
            'the essence of what Freiburg are into their new arena. It will '
            'take some getting used to. “I need months and years,” he admitted '
            'after the game. “I was there for 25 years. It somehow turned into '
            'half of my life.” He might need a map as well, having famously '
            'cycled from his home to Dreisamstadion every day.\n'
            'This season, all the familiar pieces of Freiburg are there – the '
            'long-serving Christian Günter at the back, Nils Pedersen’s goals '
            'off the bench and Vincenzo Grifo’s craft – but there are a few '
            'supplementary strands. Jeong Woo-Yeong, who didn’t make it at '
            'Bayern but scored the club’s first goal at Europa-Park a few '
            'weeks back, adds some imagination and Maxi Eggestein brings '
            'thrust in midfield having joined late in summer from Werder '
            'Bremen. So the fans in those packed stands on Saturday chanted '
            '“Zieht den Bayern die Lederhosen aus” – Take Bayern’s lederhosen '
            'off – with feeling. Freiburg have travelled to Munich in an '
            'encounter with meaning in recent memory, hoping a win on the '
            'season’s final day in May 2017 could seal a return to European '
            'competition. They were made to wait to pursue their aim – the '
            'singer Anastasia’s half-time concert went on long enough to delay '
            'the second half by nearly 10 minutes, as Arjen Robben helped '
            'carry bits of stage off the pitch so the match could resume. '
            'Freiburg eventually went down 4-1, reduced in every way to '
            'peripherals in Bayern’s title party. This time, they return to '
            'Allianz-Arena through the front door – and they deserve to share '
            'the stage on equal footing, rather than just as the support act.\n'
            'Talking points • Bayern recovered from a rare and shocking '
            'hammering – 5-0 at Borussia Mönchengladbach to exit the DfB Pokal '
            'in midweek – by rattling in five of their own at high-flying '
            'Union, ending the Berliners’ unbeaten home record. There were '
            'still signs of vulnerability as Union came back strongly after '
            'half-time – Kingsley Coman’s lightening strike to make it 4-1 '
            'suddenly killed off that comeback – but Bayern will have coach '
            'Julian Nagelsmann back from quarantine for Benfica’s Champions '
            'League visit this week. • Borussia Dortmund had their moments of '
            'fortune too, despite beating Köln 2-0, with prolific B team '
            'striker Steffen Tigges scoring a debut first-team goal and '
            'helping make light of Erling Haaland’s continued absence. The '
            'much-improved visitors were excellent, with Gregor Kobel saving '
            'BVB more than once. “Except for the result, I’m happy with a lot '
            'of things,” said their coach Steffen Baumgart, who opposite '
            'number Marco Rose added: “You have to say that Effzeh were the '
            'better team.” • Wolfsburg began the post-Mark van Bommel era in '
            'fine style, deservedly winning Florian Kohfeldt’s first game in '
            'charge 2-0 at Leverkusen, with Lukas Nmecha and Maximilian Arnold '
            'getting the goals. There was always the question at Werder Bremen '
            'as to how the imaginative Kohfeldt might have got on with a '
            'better set of players – we might be about to find out. Meanwhile, '
            'Die Wölfe have perhaps passed the crisis baton to Leverkusen, '
            'whose confidence has clearly been shaken by their thrashing from '
            'Bayern, and have now lost three in a row at home following this '
            'and the midweek Pokal exit to Karlsruhe. • Augsburg netted their '
            '50th Bundesliga win under Markus Weinzierl, coming back from a '
            'shaky start to beat Stuttgart 4-1 in some style. There was also a '
            'first goal since February 2020 for Alfred Finnbogason, who has '
            'struggled with Achilles tendon issues. “I have to lie down in the '
            'bathtub for the next few days,” he remarked afterwards.',

            'On Monday, Roberts regained his party membership, but still has '
            'the whip withdrawn, meaning he sits as an independent in '
            'parliament. However, the MP for Delyn in north Wales still sits '
            'on the government’s side of the Commons green benches, and votes '
            'in line with the Conservative whip. A Conservative party '
            'spokesperson confirmed Roberts’ readmission and that the whip '
            'remained withdrawn. Although Roberts served his suspension from '
            'parliament, he avoided being subject to a recall petition. This '
            'is usually automatically triggered when an MP is suspended for '
            'more than 10 days. However, because Roberts appealed against the '
            'initial verdict by the standards commissioner, it emerged that '
            'his punishment was not covered by the existing recall legislation '
            'because the case was then judged by a separate body known as an '
            '“independent expert panel”. The failure of Conservative '
            'headquarters “to stop Roberts’ readmission means that the '
            'withdrawal of his whip is in name only”, a senior Tory staffer '
            'told the Guardian. They added: “This sends a worrying signal to '
            'parliamentary staff members who are still dealing with predatory '
            'and abusive behaviour on a daily basis.” The Labour party chair, '
            'Anneliese Dodds, said his readmission to the Tories was '
            'scandalous, and criticised the government for voting down a '
            'motion to change the law so the punishment of a recall petition '
            'could be applied retrospectively. “Rob Roberts should have '
            'resigned as an MP the moment he was suspended from parliament for '
            'sexual misconduct,” Dodds said. That he had now returned to the '
            'Conservative party showed it had let him off the hook, she added. '
            '“Just last week, the government voted against allowing Roberts’ '
            'constituents to choose whether he is the right person to '
            'represent them, and now they are choosing to readmit him as a '
            'member of their party. Yet again, the Conservative party is '
            'acting like there’s one rule for their MPs and another rule for '
            'everyone else.” The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has '
            'called on Roberts to do the “honourable” thing and step down as '
            'an MP, but argued that retrospective punishment would go against '
            'the principle that there should be no imposition of a sanction '
            '“which was not available at the time when a given case was '
            'determined”. The investigators’ report into Roberts said that he '
            'had accepted that “aspects of his behaviour” towards a staff '
            'member were “inappropriate” and had offered to apologise but that '
            'he “rejected the categorisation of his conduct as ‘sexual’, '
            'preferring the term ‘romantic’”.',

{'article': 'Forests and nature are centre stage at Cop26. On the second day '
            'of the Glasgow summit, world leaders are announcing a commitment '
            'to halting and reversing deforestation. As the second largest '
            'source of greenhouse gases after energy, the land sector accounts '
            'for 25% of global emissions, with deforestation and forest '
            'degradation contributing to half of this. But why do forests '
            'matter to the climate, and how can we halt deforestation? What is '
            'a forest? There are an estimated three trillion trees on Earth. '
            'Some form part of enormous forest ecosystems like the Congo '
            'rainforest, while others stand in sparsely populated landscapes '
            'such as on the edges of the Sahara desert. Of the 60,000 known '
            'tree species, nearly a third are threatened with extinction, '
            'according to a recent assessment. Scientists cannot decide on a '
            'single definition of a forest due to disagreements over tree '
            'density, height and canopy cover. But the Food and Agriculture '
            'Organization’s version is commonly used: “Land with a tree canopy '
            'cover of more than 10% and area of more than 0.5 hectares.” '
            'Forest covered almost a third of the world’s landmass in 2020, '
            'with more than half found in just five countries: Russia, Brazil, '
            'Canada, the US and China. The taiga – also known as northern '
            'boreal forest – is the world’s largest, stretching around the '
            'northern hemisphere through Siberia, Canada and Scandinavia. '
            'Temperate, tropical and boreal are the three main types of forest '
            'that include a great diversity of ecosystems: cloud forest, '
            'rainforest, mangrove swamps, and tropical dry forest, among many '
            'others.\n'
            'Why do forests matter for the climate? Forests are among the most '
            'biodiverse places on the planet and form an enormous carbon '
            'store, regulating the world’s weather and climate. They hold '
            'about 861 gigatons of carbon – equivalent to nearly a century’s '
            'worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate – and '
            'absorbed twice as much carbon as they emitted in the last two '
            'decades. More carbon is stored in soil (44%) than living biomass '
            '(42%), with the rest found in dead wood (8%) and forest litter '
            '(5%). Forests like the Congo basin rainforest – the world’s '
            'second largest – affect rainfall thousands of miles away around '
            'the Nile. Billions of humans rely on forests for food, building '
            'materials and shelter.\n'
            'But they are being cleared at a relentless pace. About 10% of '
            'tree cover has been lost since 2000, according to Global Forest '
            'Watch. Although estimates vary, the land sector is the second '
            'largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for '
            'around a quarter of emissions, according to the IPCC, of which '
            'deforestation is a major component. Many scientists say it will '
            'not be possible to limit global heating to 1.5C above '
            'pre-industrial levels without halting deforestation. “There are '
            'two main points on forests and carbon,” says Yadvinder Malhi, a '
            'professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford. '
            '“Forests are a carbon store, meaning that when you deforest, '
            'you’re releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. The other thing is that '
            'intact forests have been shown to be a carbon sink, absorbing '
            'carbon over time. And if our sink is disappearing, you’re losing '
            'the service that the biosphere provides – an assumption that such '
            'a sink will continue is built into almost all of our climate '
            'model scenarios for this century.” Do all forests store the same '
            'amount of carbon? No. Old-growth forests that are free from human '
            'industrial interference and pollution are especially important '
            'for the climate and biodiversity. They are called primary forests '
            'and are ancient, carbon-dense ecosystems bursting with life such '
            'as parts of the Amazon, the Białowieża Forest in Poland and Papua '
            'New Guinea. With some of the largest trees and the biggest '
            'variety of life, conservationists place extra emphasis on their '
            'protection from logging, wildfires and human industry as they '
            'only account for one-third of the planet’s forest cover. Young or '
            'recovering forests store much less carbon and can sometimes take '
            'several years before they become effective sinks.\n'
            'Tropical rainforests, mangrove and peat swamp forests – such as '
            'those found in south-east Asia – play a disproportionally '
            'important role in regulating the climate due to the amount of '
            'carbon they store, their cooling effect and the protection they '
            'provide from flooding. Boreal forests, which are covered in snow '
            'for large parts of the year, reflect more heat back into the '
            'atmosphere and have a net warming effect on the climate. '
            'Agricultural tree plantations with very few species are much less '
            'carbon-dense and support much less life. What is deforestation? '
            'Deforestation is the human-driven conversion to another land use '
            'of a forest, such as cattle ranching or soya bean production, '
            'that is often clearcut with machinery then burnt. It is not the '
            'same as logging: trees can be selectively taken out of a standing '
            'forest. Deforestation has gone hand in hand with human '
            'development for centuries. Nearly all the temperate rainforest '
            'that once covered large parts of the British Isles was cleared '
            'for agriculture, roads and human settlements, for example. As '
            'well as being a major source of carbon emissions, land use change '
            'is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, which scientists warn '
            'is driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. From '
            'space, deforestation often follows a “fishbone pattern” where '
            'land is cleared along the edges of roads and rivers. Over time, '
            'the fishbone fills in as more of the forest is cleared. On a '
            'large scale, the process can become self-perpetuating, such as '
            'the Amazon switching from rainforest to savannah, as so much of '
            'it has been destroyed.\n'
            'Last year, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bolivia, '
            'Indonesia and Peru were the top five countries for tropical '
            'primary forest loss. About 12m hectares (30m acres) of tree cover '
            'was lost in the tropics. This includes 4.2m hectares of primary '
            'forests, an area the size of the Netherlands, releasing the '
            'equivalent to the annual emissions of 570m cars. Why do people '
            'clear forests? While there are many local factors, experts say '
            'the main reason is financial: forests are worth more dead than '
            'alive in monetary terms. In Brazil, large parts of the Amazon '
            'have been cleared for beef production. In Indonesia, forests and '
            'peatlands have been cleared and drained for oil palm plantations. '
            'In other areas, coffee, cocoa, bananas, pineapples, coca leaves '
            'and subsistence farming have driven land-clearing. Most '
            'deforestation hotspots are in tropical regions, which are also '
            'profitable areas for farming. “The largest factor is the '
            'expansion of agricultural industries: cattle ranching, soya bean '
            'farming and oil palm,” says Malhi. “A second factor is poverty. '
            'In many parts of Africa, such as Madagascar, where there is '
            'demographic pressure, a lot of poor, rural settlers are just '
            'looking to make a living on the frontier as populations increase. '
            'The same is true in parts of South America and south-east Asia.” '
            'Can we really stop deforestation? It will not be easy, but there '
            'are reasons to be hopeful. Alongside the commitment from world '
            'leaders in Glasgow at Cop26, it is hoped big producers and '
            'consumers of commodities linked to deforestation will sign up to '
            'eradicating them from the global supply chain. China – one of the '
            'world’s largest consumers – is taking deforestation more '
            'seriously and is looking at “greening” its supply chain.\n'
            '“We really need to start thinking about forest loss – especially '
            'tropical forest loss – in the same way people are now talking '
            'about coal,” says Frances Seymour, a forest and governance expert '
            'at the World Resources Institute (WRI). “There was a big '
            'celebration that China had committed to no longer financing new '
            'coal abroad. But we need to be looking for similar commitments '
            'from all countries to stop financing projects that lead to '
            'deforestation abroad.” Are there any examples we can learn from? '
            'Costa Rica is the only tropical country to successfully halt and '
            'reverse deforestation. It did so, in part, with payments from an '
            'ecosystem services programme that put an economic value on '
            'standing forests and biodiversity. The country won the first '
            'Earthshot prize this year for the scheme, reversing one of the '
            'highest deforestation rates in Latin America in the 70s and '
            'regrowing large areas of forest. On a larger scale, Brazil had '
            'considerable success at reducing deforestation in the Amazon in '
            'the late 2000s and early 2010s. Environmental laws, improved '
            'surveillance of slash-and-burn illegal logging and a soya '
            'moratorium in the Amazon were credited with the fall. However, '
            'there have since been large spikes in deforestation in the '
            'world’s largest rainforest under the presidency of Jair '
            'Bolsonaro. Indonesia has had success in recent years slowing '
            'deforestation with a palm oil expansion moratorium, although '
            'experts warn it is fragile for the same reasons: the economic '
            'incentives to clear forest have not changed. A UN scheme that '
            'provides financial incentives to protect forests – known as Redd+ '
            '– has been agreed by countries. It allows developing countries to '
            'sell carbon credits to preserve carbon sinks. Although there is '
            'still division over the rules for carbon markets, it is hoped '
            'these will be sorted at Cop26. Countries like Gabon, with low '
            'deforestation rates and large forest cover, say that they also '
            'need funding to protect forests. Gabon is the chair of the '
            'African group of negotiators for Cop26. Why are indigenous '
            'communities so important for stopping deforestation? Studies show '
            'indigenous communities are the best protectors of forests. Many '
            'landscapes thought to be wilderness have actually been managed by '
            'indigenous communities for centuries. This year, a UN review of '
            'more than 250 studies found that in Latin America, deforestation '
            'rates were lower in their territories than elsewhere. Despite '
            'this, many indigenous and tribal peoples face persecution, racism '
            'and violence. In July, a two-year trial using remote sensors to '
            'alert indigenous communities in Peru to early deforestation found '
            'a decrease in tree loss of 37% overall for both years, compared '
            'to the control group. Researchers say that if this was scaled up, '
            'it could have a big effect on reducing deforestation.\n'
            'Jessica Webb, senior manager for global engagement at Global '
            'Forest Watch, says: “A third of the Amazon rainforest falls '
            'within approximately 3,300 formally acknowledged territories of '
            'indigenous peoples. Based on modelling we did with our partner '
            'Rainforest Foundation US, as a result of this study, we predict '
            'that an additional 123,000 hectares a year of deforestation could '
            'be prevented by scaling this approach to other communities within '
            'the Amazon. It would be the equivalent of taking 21m cars off the '
            'road for a year.”\n'
            'Can satellites protect forests? Ecosystem monitoring is '
            'experiencing a technological revolution. Deforestation is easier '
            'to track through a dataset developed by researchers at the '
            'University of Maryland, Nasa and Google. As image resolutions '
            'improve, we are close to being able to monitor deforestation in '
            'real time. But “there are still gaps on being able to monitor '
            'restoration and degradation”, says Crystal Davis, director at the '
            'Land & Carbon Lab, a WRI initiative that aims to provide '
            'information on how the world can meet climate and biodiversity '
            'commitments and the needs of 10 billion humans. “We also need a '
            'better understanding of the accuracy of global datasets. They are '
            'not consistent across geography,” she says. What about '
            'reforestation? The world needs to restore forests to meet climate '
            'and biodiversity goals. But scientists say halting deforestation '
            'is an urgent task as it emits carbon immediately whereas it takes '
            'decades for nature to recover and sequester carbon. Primary '
            'forests that have stood for thousands of years cannot be replaced '
            'by tree-planting schemes. What if we don’t stop deforestation? '
            'Cutting emissions from fossil fuels is the most urgent task to '
            'avoid more global heating. But if the world continues to lose '
            'forests, we risk triggering tipping points with unintended '
            'consequences. The Amazon could turn into savannah, boreal forests '
            'could die back and carbon stores that took thousands of years to '
            'sequester could be released. What this would mean for food '
            'security, weather systems and millions of other species is '
            'unlikely to be good news, experts warn. Robert Nasi, head of the '
            'Center for International Forestry Research, says: “We would have '
            'climatic change that is cascading: the drying of the Amazon, the '
            'Congo Basin … there is a lot of risk of a domino effect. If we '
            'don’t protect the forests, people will migrate, there will be '
            'climate refugees.” With thanks to: Crystal Davis, director at the '

{'article': '“That’s the closest to death I’ll ever be without actually '
            'dying,” the Australian cyclist Jack Bobridge said in January 2015 '
            'after he had failed to break the hour record. He had ridden '
            '51.3km around a track in 60 minutes but he was still half a '
            'kilometre short of the world record. “I can’t even describe how '
            'much pain my gluts and quads are in, it’s unbelievable.” Years '
            'before, in October 1972, Eddy Merckx, one of the greatest '
            'cyclists to have lived, set a record for the hour in Mexico when '
            'he rode 49.43km. He could not speak when, his face etched in '
            'suffering, he was helped off his bike. Merckx said later: “Never '
            'before had I had such pain. It was the hardest ride I’ve ever '
            'done and I never felt such pain again.” On Wednesday, at the '
            'velodrome in Aguascalientes, Mexico, Alex Dowsett will attempt to '
            'reclaim the hour record he held briefly in 2015 before Bradley '
            'Wiggins broke it 36 days later. Dowsett will try to ride more '
            'than the 55.089km Victor Campenaerts covered at the same track '
            'when setting a world mark in April 2019.\n'
            'The hour is regarded as one of the most brutal challenges in '
            'sport but Dowsett is refreshingly laconic. He is still sorting '
            'out the logistics of his latest crack at the record and points '
            'out wryly that organising the ride might be harder than the '
            'physical pain: “My coach, Michael Hutchinson, said it’s like '
            'organising a world championships and then going out and competing '
            'in it.” Dowsett has a remarkable personal story and is proud to '
            'spend as much time in our 80 minutes together talking about the '
            'fact that haemophilia has not prevented him from carving out a '
            'successful career in the unforgiving world of professional '
            'cycling. He is determined his new tilt at the hour record will '
            'give fresh momentum to the Little Bleeders charity he started in '
            '2016. The aim is to encourage the 3,000 young people who were '
            'born with the rare condition in Britain to understand that '
            'haemophilia should not limit their ambitions. Before we chart his '
            'own past as a little bleeder, and his hopes of raising awareness '
            'of a condition that hits men far more than women, with one in '
            '10,000 males in the UK affected by haemophilia, I ask Dowsett if '
            'he expects to endure as gruelling an ordeal as Merckx did. “Not '
            'at all. I hate saying this because it’s the great Eddy Merckx but '
            'he didn’t do the hour record that efficiently. “He broke the 10km '
            'and 20km marks because he went out of the blocks like a greyhound '
            'and hung on. That’s the worst way to do an hour record and not '
            'something I’d ever want to experience.\n'
            '“The only other person to do that was Jack Bobridge and he became '
            'a verb in the Movistar camp [the cycling team for whom Dowsett '
            'rode] back in 2015 when I did the record. We all said: ‘We don’t '
            'want to do a Bobridge.’ So for me the first 30 minutes will be '
            'very controlled and disciplined and then the second 30 is where '
            'you start working out what you can do. “For lots of people it’s '
            'the biggest thing they’ll ever do so there are tales of Eddie '
            'Merckx and all those horror stories. But it is only an hour. It’s '
            'not a six-hour slog in the mountains of a Grand Tour when you’re '
            '18 days deep into one. It can be broken down and, all things '
            'being equal, you should get the first 20 minutes for free. After '
            'that it will be looking at 10-lap blocks or five-minute chunks. '
            '“Mike Hutchinson will be on the side of the track giving me '
            'pacing feedback every lap. So I know if I stick to certain lap '
            'times I will break the record. The challenge will be at the back '
            'end of the hour to start adjusting or maintaining the pace.”\n'
            'Did he maintain such concentration throughout his successful ride '
            'in Manchester in 2015? “I wasn’t on my absolute limit so I could '
            'listen to the commentator. I saw where my mates were round the '
            'track whereas this one will be much tougher. I’m not sure where '
            'I’ll be mentally.” Dowsett regards his 2015 world record with '
            'some regret. “It was actually a very enjoyable experience because '
            'I knew after 40 minutes I was going to break the record. We had '
            'about 3,000 people [in the velodrome] and it was unforgettable. '
            'But afterwards, looking at the numbers, we knew we’d been too '
            'safe. “It’s haunted me because I could have given Wiggins quite a '
            'task. I got the record and everyone was happy – but there was a '
            'slight hollow feeling. I could have done much more and, after '
            'months of work, I probably used only 80% of what I’m capable of. '
            'It should have been around the 54km mark. Wiggins rode 54.457km. '
            '“It was going to be his great swansong and we were expecting 55 '
            'or 56km. But had he done 56km then Victor and I might not have '
            'attempted it.” He was meant to race in the hour this time last '
            'year, again in Manchester, but he contracted Covid. Dowsett was '
            'disappointed because, having won a stage of the Giro d’Italia '
            'last October, “I had been feeling really fantastic and, in '
            'Manchester, the only variable is air pressure. On the day we were '
            'meant to make the attempt it was perfect – but these things '
            'happen.”\n'
            'The marked difference between this attempt and his two previous '
            'campaigns is that Dowsett and his partner, Chanel, have done the '
            'overwhelming bulk of organising the event in Mexico – even though '
            'they are new parents to their daughter, Juliette. “It’s been far '
            'more arduous for Chanel,” he says. “She is really organising it '
            'but you can’t help but be involved in the trials and '
            'tribulations. The list of requirements needed to ride a bike '
            'round a velodrome for an hour is vast. But through sheer hard '
            'work it has come together.” Dowsett has been galvanised by his '
            'desire to use the hour record to publicise how haemophilia should '
            'not be a barrier to anyone. “My parents did a wonderful job '
            'shielding me from the negatives around haemophilia when I was '
            'young. Every so often we look back, whether it’s the finish line '
            'of the Tour de France or the hour record or any of the '
            'unimaginable things I’ve achieved. “If we’d had a crystal ball '
            'back then and known everything was going to be better than all '
            'right I’m not sure my parents would have believed it.” They '
            'initially struggled to get a diagnosis. “Being a dad now I '
            'appreciate what they went through and my mum says I owe her a '
            'facelift. I was a happy, healthy baby but mum and dad would '
            'notice how easily I bruised. They’d pick me up and when they put '
            'me down I’d have two black bruised thumb prints across my rib '
            'cage. Mum knew something wasn’t right and took me to the doctors '
            'numerous times – but they kept sending her away and saying: ‘He’s '
            'just a baby that bruises easily.’ “When I was 18 months old Mum '
            'demanded I had a blood test. She remembers the doctor threw the '
            'documents across the table because the idea of putting an '
            '18-month-old through a blood test was, to him, worse than '
            'anything. On the way out of the blood test I fell over and split '
            'the skin between my lip and gum. “There are 13 steps to the blood '
            'clotting and, as a haemophiliac, I don’t have the eighth one. A '
            'cut will look like it’s healing until that eighth stage and then '
            'everything breaks down.\n'
            '“Mum and Dad put me to bed that night thinking all was well and '
            'the little cut was healing up. They checked on me at two in the '
            'morning and I was asleep in a pool of my own blood. So they rang '
            'the doctor because they thought I had leukaemia. A different '
            'doctor said: ‘I think your son’s got haemophilia.’ Then the blood '
            'test results came back and I had severe haemophilia A. The '
            'original doctor apologised and said: ‘I need to research '
            'haemophilia more and trust a mother’s intuition.’” There were '
            'many difficult days and, because there was a blood transfusion '
            'link then between haemophilia and HIV, Alex did not often get '
            'invited to birthday parties as a schoolboy. He also sometimes '
            'turned up at school on crutches or with his arm in a sling. It '
            'was only when the right medication became available, and he was '
            'advised to be as fit as possible, that life became easier. He '
            'swam a lot and then everything changed when, with his dad, he '
            'discovered cycling.\n'
            'Dowsett believes people are more informed about the condition but '
            'is he surprised that haemophiliac elite athletes are so rare? '
            '“When I was young the treatment had just been introduced. The '
            'treatment I’m on now stops me having a bleeding episode whereas '
            'when I was younger the treatment was to fix the bleeding, so it '
            'was reactive. Now medication is proactive. So I’m the first in a '
            'generation that can achieve elite-sport level because if I’d been '
            'born a decade earlier it wouldn’t have been possible to sustain '
            'any kind of training. We are very lucky it’s life-changing '
            'medication.” He has lived the life of an ordinary professional '
            'cyclist for 11 years – which has brought him two Giro stage wins, '
            'a European under-23 title and multiple national time-trial '
            'championships as well as the uncertainty of racing for teams that '
            'go out of business. Dowsett moved from the disbanded Katusha to '
            'the new Israel Start-Up Nation in 2020 and there was great '
            'anxiety last year. He was unsure whether his contract would be '
            'extended before he won a hard Giro stage after a solo breakaway. '
            'Dowsett cried with relief and, as he says now: “It was tough '
            'because Juliette was on the way and I thought my cycling career '
            'was ending.\n'
            '“It was also frightening as cycling was the only income Chanel '
            'and I had. Winning that stage bought me another two years and '
            'sharpened my focus on the hour record. Each year since 2015 I’d '
            'asked whichever team I was on: ‘Can we do the hour?’ Each time '
            'there was noncommittal pushback and so Chanel and I said: ‘We’re '
            'doing it ourselves.’” Now they’re so close how is Dowsett '
            'feeling? “Hutch said: ‘There are two ways of dealing with it, '
            'Alex. You can try and escape the stress or just embrace it.’ So '
            'Chanel and I keep thinking: ‘No matter how hard it is, we are '
            'glad we’re doing this.’ It’s a hell of an experience. “Victor '
            'Campenaerts has given me a 50-50 chance of breaking it and I’m '
            'not scared to fail. It would have been easy to not do this '
            'attempt, especially with the organisation, but failing is a far '
            'better alternative to not trying. There’s something quite '
            'poignant there for the haemophilia community.”',

            'Researchers at the Public Religion Research Institute, a '

            'violence may be required. The troubling statistics show the '
            'post-election rancour that led to the violent insurrection at the '
            'US Capitol on 6 January is still very much in place. Republicans '
            'are most likely to believe “true American patriots may have to '
            'resort to violence”, PRRI found, with just 11% of Democrats and '
            '17% of independents agreeing with the statement. Among all '
            'Americans, 18% agreed. PRRI said 2,508 adults, living in all 50 '
            'states, were interviewed for the survey between 16 and 29 '
            'September. “It is an alarming finding,” Robert Jones, chief '
            'executive and founder of PRRI, told Yahoo News. “I’ve been doing '
            'this a while, for decades, and it’s not the kind of finding that '
            'as a sociologist, a public opinion pollster, that you’re used to '
            'seeing.” Jones said the responses illustrate the “significant and '
            'rapidly increasing polarisation in the United States”. “As we’ve '
            'gotten some distance [from the 6 January], one might hope cooler '
            'heads would prevail, but we really haven’t seen that,” Jones '
            'said. “If anything, it looks like people are doubling down and '
            'views are getting kind of locked in.” The PRRI poll is not the '

{'article': 'Optimistic assessments of progress on tackling the climate crisis '
            'were “an illusion”, the UN secretary general has said in a '
            'scathing critique of world leaders’ efforts so far to cut '
            'greenhouse gas emissions and stave off climate breakdown. António '
            'Guterres, greeting leaders gathering for the Cop26 summit, '
            'roundly dismissed the suggestion that the climate situation was '
            'improving, and he exhorted the more than 120 heads of government '
            'to “choose to safeguard our future and save humanity” instead of '
            'continuing with the addiction to fossil fuels. “Recent climate '
            'action announcements might give the impression that we are on '
            'track to turn things around. This is an illusion,” he told the '
            'conference in Glasgow.\n'
            'G20 leaders met at the weekend without making fresh commitments '
            'to further cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, though they did '
            'agree on the importance of taking action this decade. Scientists '
            'say emissions must be cut by about 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 '
            'levels, to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above '
            'pre-industrial levels, the threshold of safety. The UK, as host '
            'of Cop26, has set as its aim to “keep 1.5C alive”. Two days of '
            'talks among world leaders will be followed by nearly a fortnight '
            'of tense negotiations by officials with the aim of producing a '
            'global deal to get on track for the emissions cuts necessary. But '
            'Guterres said nations were still far off track on their plans to '
            'cut greenhouse gas emissions as the conference opened. Without '
            'further commitments, he said, countries could be forced to return '
            'to the negotiating table not every five years, as set out in the '
            'Paris agreement, but every year. That threat will unsettle some '
            'countries at the talks that have been slow to come forward with '
            'strong commitments on cutting emissions and want to stick to the '
            'letter of the Paris agreement and only update commitments on a '
            'five-year schedule. Small developing countries, those with the '
            'most at stake in the climate crisis, want a more frequent '
            'schedule. Guterres said humanity stood on the brink of disaster '
            'and had been driven there by an addiction to fossil fuels and its '
            '“brutal” treatment of the natural world. Further global heating – '
            'with temperature rises already at 1.1C – would risk pushing the '
            'world past the point of no return.\n'
            '“We face a moment of truth. We are fast approaching tipping '
            'points that will trigger escalating feedback loops of global '
            'heating,” he said. Scientists have said surpassing 1.5C would '
            'risk some of the consequences of climate change, including ice '
            'sheet melting, rapidly becoming irreversible. Guterres gave a '
            'stark depiction of human ruin, with the planet changing before '
            'our eyes in the form of melting glaciers, disappearing forests '
            'and polluted oceans, the result of “treating nature like a '
            'toilet”. He said: “We face a stark choice: either we stop [the '
            'addiction] or it stops us. It’s time to say: enough. Enough of '
            'brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with '
            'carbon.” In an echo of the film Trainspotting, which was set in '
            'nearby Edinburgh, he called on leaders to shake off the addiction '
            'and choose a better path. “Choose ambition. Choose solidarity. '
            'Choose to safeguard our future and save humanity,” he said. '
            'Finance to help poor countries was also a crucial issue, Guterres '
            'said. A promise to developing countries of $100bn (£73bn) a year '
            'in climate finance by 2020 has not been met. Guterres said recent '
            'findings that it would be met from 2023 would “delay the largest '
            'support for years, with no clear guarantees”.\n'
            'The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, also spoke at the opening '
            'ceremony, and began his speech with a James Bond analogy. Bond '
            'often ends up in peril, said Johnson, “strapped to a doomsday '
            'device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to '
            'pull to turn it off while a red digital clock ticks down '
            'remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know '
            'it. “And we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global '
            'leaders, as James Bond today, except that the tragedy is that '
            'this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.” He also '
            'spoke of rich countries’ responsibility to pull their weight: “We '
            'in the developed world must recognise the special responsibility '
            'to help everybody else to do it, because it was here in Glasgow '
            '250 years ago that James Watt came up with a machine that was '
            'powered by steam that was produced by burning coal.” “Yes my '
            'friends, we have brought you to the very place where the doomsday '
            'device began to tick.” The prime minister also urged '
            'representatives to consider their responsibility to future '
            'generations: “The people who will judge us are children not yet '
            'born, and their children, and we are now coming centre stage '
            'before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity and we must '
            'not fluff our lines or miss our cue. “Because if we fail they '
            'will not forgive us. They will know that Glasgow was the historic '
            'turning point when history failed to turn. They will judge us '
            'with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the '
            'climate activists of today, and they will be right. Cop26 will '
            'not, cannot, be the end of the story on climate change.”',

{'article': 'The defining choice facing leaders in Glasgow this week at Cop26 '
            'is whether to sugar-coat reality or be honest about the climate '
            'emergency, and demand the action that will be necessary to '
            'confront it. If we are to have any chance of preventing '
            'catastrophe, we must choose truth and candour. The most important '
            'truth is the maths. For all the millions of words spilled about '
            'this summit, not enough has been done to spell out its central '
            'task. Many leaders say we need to limit global warming to 1.5 '
            'degrees, but few say out loud what that means. We know from the '
            'UN’s figures that after the Paris accord of 2015, the world was '
            'heading for something like 53 billion tonnes of emissions in '
            '2030. To keep global heating in line with 1.5C degrees, we need '
            'to cut emissions to 25 billion tonnes by then. There is an '
            'emissions gap of 28bn tonnes to be cut in this decisive decade. '
            'These numbers should be in the minds of everyone who cares about '
            'our planet’s future.\n'
            'The world has taken important strides forward in recent years. '
            'But the unfortunate reality is that the pledges made in advance '
            'of Cop26 amount to a cut of just 4bn tonnes. This leaves an '
            'aching emissions gap within which climate catastrophe would occur '
            '– putting us on track to a devastating 2.7C. This maths matters '
            'more than anything, and should shape our response to what '
            'countries announce at Glasgow. According to the respected Climate '
            'Action Tracker, no G20 country is doing enough. It will be in the '
            'interests of leaders and ministers at Cop26 to pretend more '
            'progress has been made than is the reality. Since we cannot '
            'negotiate with the science, we must force them – particularly '
            'those who have arrived in Glasgow only to reheat old commitments '
            '– to confront the truth and negotiate with each other. This '
            'summit cannot be a fortnight’s fiesta of pre-packaged '
            'announcements; it must amount to a real reckoning to deliver the '
            'progress we need. As part of this, leaders must deliver justice '
            'for those in poorer countries who are least responsible for, and '
            'most vulnerable to, climate breakdown. It’s time to make good on '
            'the promises stacked up, but not delivered – in particular the '
            'long overdue $100bn of finance that was promised for developing '
            'countries back in 2009, and the prime minister’s pledge at the G7 '
            'in June to “vaccinate the world” against Covid. It’s essential '
            'that we also recognise the loss and damage many poorer and '
            'developing countries face from climate breakdown. This is the way '
            'to help reassemble the coalition we saw in Paris between the most '
            'vulnerable developing countries and ambitious developed '
            'countries, to maximise pressure on the world’s biggest emitters, '
            'including China. We must also head off the attempt to shift the '
            'scientific goalposts at Glasgow, which has crept into the UK '
            'government’s benchmark of success for these talks. It is positive '
            'that countries representing 80% of global GDP are now covered by '
            'a net zero target for the middle of the century, but targets '
            'three decades in the future do not make up for a failure to act '
            'now. No country can be allowed to think that setting long-term '
            'targets gives them an alibi to not act in the short term. Take '
            'Australia, for example, whose 2050 net zero target, announced '
            'last week, is accompanied by a 2030 target which puts us on track '
            'for a 4C world. Or Saudi Arabia, which is mulling a 2060 target, '
            'while planning to increase its oil production over this decade. '
            'We cannot stand for such global greenwashing at this summit from '
            'our country or anyone else’s.\n'
            'Telling these truths is not without its risks. Some people will '
            'worry that any admission of falling short in Glasgow will give '
            'the world and private investors reason to give up on their '
            'climate ambitions. Many of us remember the long shadow that was '
            'cast after the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, when the summit crash '
            'landed without comprehensive agreement. We cannot afford the same '
            'hangover, whatever the result in Glasgow. The world has come too '
            'far for that to happen. But that cannot be reason to pretend '
            'progress is fast enough if the reality is otherwise. That’s '
            'because the inescapable truth is that, with the climate crisis, '
            'unlike so many other issues, winning slowly is not really '
            'winning. In this existential race against time, winning slowly '
            'means billions of people facing extreme heatwaves, countless '
            'millions more people displaced, and the destruction of natural '
            'wonders like our coral reefs. It also means forfeiting the '
            'opportunities that climate action offers, such as lifting people '
            'out of poverty by creating millions of good, green jobs. The '
            'truth matters both for the outcomes of Cop26 but also for what '
            'happens afterwards. The world is not due to return to the issue '
            'of country-by-country pledges until the next Cop26 happens in '
            '2025. If we follow this course, we will forfeit 1.5C. We will '
            'need to come back much sooner to close the gap we face if we are '
            'to create a path out of Glasgow compatible with 1.5 degrees. We '
            'are all desperate for success over the next fortnight. But as we '
            'approach this crucial summit, those of us who are not in '
            'government have one power those in office will find it hard to '
            'fully embrace: the power to tell the truth about our progress in '
            'this decisive decade, however uncomfortable that may be. Playing '
            'our part in getting the right outcome means using this power '
            'without hesitation in the next two vital weeks. • Ed Miliband is '

            'improving working conditions was vital for sectors suffering from '
            'acute labour shortages. In the wake of a report suggesting almost '
            'one in four workers were considering quitting their jobs in the '
            'next few months, the Autonomy poll of more than 1,000 workers in '
            'the care, transport and logistics, and hospitality industries '
            'showed: 41% were considering leaving their job in the next 12 '
            'months. Low pay, long working hours and poor mental health were '
            'often cited as reasons for dissatisfaction. The majority of those '
            'considering quitting had been offered no incentives to stay by '
            'their employers. Workers in these sectors reported that a pay '
            'rise, shorter working hours for the same pay and better in-work '
            'benefits such as holiday pay and pensions would stop them from '
            'resigning. UK job vacancies are at a record high, reaching 1.1m '
            'in the latest data reported by the Office for National '
            'Statistics, and Autonomy said shortages of labour had had a '
            'severe impact on business, leading to a loss of clients and '
            'income through an inability to deliver services and products. '
            'Will Stronge, the thinktank’s director of research, said: “The '
            'good news is that the labour market crisis can be solved fairly '
            'easily by offering better working conditions. “However, the '
            'response by companies is falling far short of what is needed and '
            'unless they quickly come up with a better offer, our research '
            'suggests the crisis is going to get a lot worse in the next 12 '
            'months. “The Covid pandemic has shone a spotlight on unfair and '
            'precarious working practices in Britain and it seems that workers '

{'article': 'Giovanni Simeone gets tired of every conversation coming back to '
            'his father. All through his development as a youth player, he had '
            'to put up with the suspicions of strangers. People who might have '
            'never seen him play, yet chose to believe he was having certain '
            'opportunities because his dad, Diego, had been a superstar player '
            'and was on the path to becoming one as a manager. Even now, 26 '
            'years old and enjoying his sixth season as a starter in Serie A, '
            'Giovanni knows every success will come with a predictable line of '
            'questioning. After scoring twice to bury Juventus on Saturday, he '
            'was asked whether he was carrying on a family tradition of '
            'antipathy towards the Bianconeri. “Dad wrote his story,” said the '
            'younger Simeone. “I am writing my own.”\n'
            'What a tale it has been lately. The weekend before, he had '
            'hammered four goals past Lazio. It becomes hard to avoid '
            'mentioning family ties when you have the most prolific afternoon '
            'of your career against the club where your father enjoyed some of '
            'the greatest years of his. Diego texted to tell him it was the '
            'best he had seen him play, but that was not the reaction that '
            'moved Giovanni the most. “The [Verona] storekeeper, Antonio, got '
            'emotional, started to cry and hugged me,” he said, two days '
            'later. “It was really touching. We are like a family here.”\n'
            'Verona have made a dramatic start to the season: losing their '
            'first three games and firing the manager, Eusebio Di Francesco, '
            'before transforming into one of the most entertaining teams in '
            'Serie A under his replacement, Igor Tudor. They have scored 21 '
            'goals in eight matches since – more than any other team in the '
            'division over that stretch – and had claimed wins over Roma and '
            'Lazio before they welcomed Juventus to the Bentegodi on Saturday. '
            'Most observers expected to see a reaction from the Bianconeri '
            'after their midweek defeat to Sassuolo. Instead, Simeone pounced '
            'before they could get a foothold in the game. In the 11th minute, '
            'he swept home a rebound after Antonin Barak’s shot was blocked. '
            'Three minutes later, he struck again: firing from outside the box '
            'into the top right corner after cutting in from the left.\n'
            'Juventus’s defence was at fault, backing off and affording him '
            'space, but this was a finish few ould have pulled off. Goalkeeper '
            'Wojciech Szczesny had plenty of time to see the shot coming but '
            'the precise trajectory gave him no chance. Simeone put the ball '
            'in the net a third time before the half-hour mark but was denied '
            'a hat-trick due to a foul by Gianluca Caprari. On another day, '
            'that missed opportunity may have come back to haunt Verona. Paulo '
            'Dybala hit the woodwork for Juventus and Weston McKennie saw a '
            'shot saved at point-blank range before finally pulling one goal '
            'back. But that was all the Old Lady could manage. Defeat was a '
            'catastrophe for Juventus, leaving them 16 points off the pace at '
            'the top of Serie A. Their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, '
            'described their league position as shameful. Talk of winning back '
            'the Scudetto they surrendered last season for the first time in a '
            'decade has been replaced with questions about whether they can '
            'get back into the top four.\n'
            'None of which is for Simeone to worry about. This was the most '
            'extraordinary week of his career, scoring six times in seven days '
            'despite starting two of three games. He played the last 24 '
            'minutes of the 1-1 draw with Udinese on Wednesday, replacing '
            'Nikola Kalinic, without getting his name on the scoresheet. '
            'Simeone owes a debt to Tudor, who outmanoeuvred Allegri just as '
            'he had done to Maurizio Sarri and José Mourinho before. '
            'Stationing the left wing-back, Darko Lazovic, high up the pitch, '
            'the manager forced Juan Cuadrado to play a more defensive game '
            'and obliged Juventus to attack down the left, where Alex Sandro '
            'has been less effective. Lazovic, Barak and Caprari have thrived '
            'under the new manager, who served as an assistant to Andrea Pirlo '
            'at Juventus last season. Some in Turin are starting to wonder '
            'whether he ought to have been given the top job, but Tudor has '
            'benefited also from a Verona dressing room pulling in the same '
            'direction. Even before embarking on his scoring spree, Simeone '
            'had spoken of his close relationship with Kalinic – who he is '
            'alternates games with up front. “Usually, players in the same '
            'role don’t talk much because of the rivalry [for places],” he '
            'said at the start of last month. “Between us two, it’s not like '
            'that.”\n'
            'It may become harder for Tudor to keep rotating if Simeone '
            'maintains this form. His eight Serie A goals are second only to '
            'the nine scored by Fiorentina’s Dusan Vlahovic. Cautious minds '
            'will point out e has had hot streaks before, but never sustained '
            'that form through a full campaign. He has yet to top the 14 goals '
            'he scored while playing for the Viola in 2017-18. Last season at '
            'Cagliari, he struck five times before the end of October and once '
            'more thereafter. He was playing for a struggling team and had his '
            'best stretch of form interrupted by coronavirus, but has said he '
            'could have done more. Simeone has credited his own improvement to '
            'a renewed work ethic, saying he was in the gym every day over the '
            'summer – even while on his honeymoon. He has spoken about using '
            'daily meditation to keep himself on track, as well as other '
            'techniques. Simeone claimed to have woken up before the Lazio '
            'game feeling not quite right, but corrected those sensations with '

            'Zoetrope was bankrupt – it was a low period for me. But then I '
            'received a letter written by Jo Ellen Misakian, a junior school '
            'librarian from Fresno, California. It read: “We are all so '
            'impressed with the book, The Outsiders by SE Hinton, that a '
            'petition has been circulated asking that it be made into a movie. '
            'We have chosen you to send it to.” It contained about 15 pages of '
            'children’s signatures written in different-coloured pens. It was '
            'very moving. I read Susan Hinton’s book, written when she was in '
            'her late teens, and was touched by the level of regard these poor '
            '“Greaser” kids had for each other, even though they didn’t have '
            'the advantages of their “Social” rivals. I’ve always believed '
            'that kids have many more feelings than we give them credit for, '
            'and I wanted to make the story. When I was about 17, I had been a '
            'drama counsellor at a summer camp, and the idea of being with '
            'half a dozen kids in the country and making a movie seemed like '
            'being a camp counsellor again. I’d forget my troubles and have '
            'some laughs.\n'
            'If my company was famous for anything, it was casting new, '
            'unknown actors. I believed in the concept of open casting calls – '
            'but I tried to do them in a way that was appropriate for the film '
            'we were making. For The Outsiders, I had all the candidates – '
            'which included Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Robert Downey Jr, '
            'Patrick Swayze, Dennis Quaid, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe and Emilio '
            'Estevez – sitting on benches in a circle watching each other '
            'trying for the different parts. No one knows more about acting '
            'than other actors. Tom Cruise, who ended up in a small role, was '
            'an intense kid who would do anything to make his part better.\n'
            'Often I err on the side of being too collaborative. I re-edited '
            'The Outsiders because Warner Brothers felt it was long, and that '
            'was a mistake. My father had also written a soaring, romantic '
            'score for it. I wondered if it was the right choice, but I '
            'couldn’t say that to him. By the time I recut the movie in 2005 '
            'he had passed away, and I balanced the schmaltzy music with more '
            'of what the Greasers would have listened to: early Elvis Presley '
            'and stuff like that. There are parallels between the rivalry of '
            'the Socs and the Greasers, and the inequality in American today. '
            'Most of the bads of contemporary civilisation are not caused by '
            'nature. Civilisation invents fictions that people will kill for, '
            'which is absurd. Why is there such inequality when we’re all one '
            'family?\n'
            'C Thomas Howell, who played Ponyboy Curtis I had established '
            'myself in my teens as a junior rodeo competitor. Pressure for me '
            'was riding a bull, not meeting someone called Francis Ford '
            'Coppola, or auditioning against the other guys. I only auditioned '
            'for one character, Ponyboy Curtis, and read with hundreds of '
            'actors in four or five cities. The only time I ever felt any '
            'pressure was when Norman Mailer’s son came in to read for it '
            'weeks after I felt I had already owned the role. But I think '
            'actually that was more about relieving me for half a day. There '
            'was an envy that was intentionally dialled in to the Soc and '
            'Greaser actors. We played football and basketball against each '
            'other – they had matching jumpsuits, while we’d show up in '
            'whatever we brought from home. The Socs stayed on floor 18 or 19 '
            'of the hotel, while the Greasers were on four or five. It was '
            'like a fraternity house in there; some pretty crazy stuff took '
            'place. Once I got home at three in the morning after an 18-hour '
            'shift; I couldn’t wait to get into my room and go to sleep. And I '
            'went in there, two of the Socs had turned everything in my room '
            'upside down. We rehearsed and shot the whole film on videotape '
            'first, which allowed us to get to know each other and created a '
            'trust. I was very green at 15. I had been in ET, but I had never '
            'played a lead. Francis was a master communicator, and taught me '
            'about film-making. He was patient enough to not just bully his '
            'way around and tell you what to do. And he’d cook you pasta for '
            'lunch. One lesson I learned was to never, as an actor, cut a '
            'scene. During the scene at the drive-in cinema, at one point Matt '
            'Dillon fell off his chair, and I turned to the camera and started '
            'laughing, thinking they’d cut. But he told me I shouldn’t stop, '
            'but that I should adapt to what was happening: it creates '
            'something very natural, more real and connected than anything '
            'that could be written. Later, in the church scene, a dolly grip’s '
            'foot fell through the floor – it was a real abandoned building – '
            'so I just said: “I think there’s a monster outside.” And Francis '
            'ended up cutting to a shot of a raccoon outside. The film is '
            'peppered with real moments like that. I still get letters about '
            'The Outsiders because it’s required reading in a lot of schools. '
            'People tell me it’s their comfort film, or they have a Stay Gold '
            'tattoo, or they used the Robert Frost poem for their wedding '
            'vows. I get asked all the time what the poem means. I had no idea '
            'when I was 15 that it represents the circle of life. Even the two '
            'boys don’t understand what it means – they’re just sharing a '
            'moment – until one of them dies. The fans are crying and upset '
            'that [Ralph Macchio’s character] Johnny is dead, and then they '

{'article': 'Boys and men are more likely than women to die as teenagers or '
            'young adults, according to new research that warns the gender gap '
            'in mortality rates for that age group is widening in many '
            'countries. In 2019, nearly two thirds (61%) of all deaths among '
            '10- to 24-year-olds worldwide occurred in males, said the '
            'research published in the Lancet last week. Since 1950, mortality '
            'rates in males aged 10 to 24 have decreased by 15.3%, lagging '
            'behind improvements in female mortality rates, which decreased by '
            '30% in this age group. Differences in mortality were greatest in '
            'Latin America and the Caribbean, where the mortality rate in men '
            'aged 20 to 24 was more than three times that for women. '
            'Interpersonal violence and conflict were the leading cause of '
            'death for men aged 15 to 24 in this region, where, over the past '
            '20 years, there has been little to no improvement in mortality '
            'for this age group, said the research. Leading causes of death '
            'for men in 2019 varied according to age and region. In men aged '
            '10 to 14, most deaths were due to accidents in all regions except '
            'high-income ones, where cancer was the leading cause, and south '
            'Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where it was diseases from consuming '
            'contaminated food or water. In men aged 15 to 24, the most common '
            'cause of death was “transport injury” in almost all regions. The '
            'research said that widening gender inequities in many regions '
            'have been driven by poor progress in addressing the leading '
            'causes of death for boys and young men. Joseph Ward, of '
            'University College London’s child health institute, one of the '
            'authors of the research, said: “High numbers of deaths in males '
            'indicate increases in the proportion of deaths due to violence, '
            'trauma and substance misuse, which predominately affect young '
            'males. This reflects a failure to address some of the leading '
            'causes of mortality in this age group.”\n'
            'The report also suggested that young people in the 10–24 age '
            'group were being neglected by policymakers and that the Covid-19 '
            'pandemic would probably jeopardise efforts to improve mortality '
            'rates. The research said while programmes to address the social '
            'conditions in which young women live, and the impact of violence '
            'against them, were fundamental to improving adolescent health '
            'globally, boys had been left behind. “Inequitable gender norms '
            'are also damaging to adolescent males, and advancing the health '
            'of all adolescents requires action to reduce inequities in '
            'outcomes wherever they occur,” it said. Ward added that '
            'improvements in mortality rates in 10- to 24-year-olds generally '
            'were lagging behind other age groups. He said policymakers had '
            'failed to address the specific health risks of this age group and '
            'adolescent-specific programmes were insufficiently funded. This '
            'was highlighted by many countries having “relatively good '
            'mortality outcomes for young children, but some of the highest '
            'mortality globally in adolescent age groups”, he said. '
            'Sub-Saharan Africa has seen the slowest improvements in mortality '
            'rates, added Ward, resulting in the burden of global deaths in '
            'these age groups shifting towards that region. This article was '
            'amended on 2 November 2021. The report found that in 2019 males '
            'accounted for 61% of deaths of 10- to 24-year-olds, not that '
            'males aged 10 to 24 accounted for 61% of all global deaths as '
            'stated in an earlier version due to an editing error.',

            'development of the green economy and the much-needed jobs it '
            'promises to offer. Innumerable business leaders have urged the '

            'government’s own Climate Change Committee and its chief '

            'world, I am passionately engaged with climate justice, global '
            'warming and biodiversity. The Hebrew Bible sees human beings as '
            'guardians of the Earth, entrusted to work it for the benefit of '
            'all life. The Bible’s central values are justice and compassion. '
            'The Torah repeatedly reminds us of our responsibility to our '
            'children. We owe them the legacy of a viable and sustainable '
            'planet, rich in life. We are not entitled to commodify, monetise '
            'and exploit creation. We are not entitled to follow short-term '
            'self-interest only. It’s not a case of “Tomorrow we may die”, but '
            '“Tomorrow they, the world’s children, will die”. The future of '
            'all life is in our hands. These principles, by which I seek to '
            'live as a Jew, are shared by all religions and innumerable people '
            'of no faith alike. Deeper than the anger are the anguish and fear '
            'I experience and share with so many. I feel desperate that, while '
            'lip service is duly paid to what we know we need to do, in the UK '
            'and across the world, the government’s actions point in a '
            'different direction. Where the money goes is what sends the real '
            'message. Yet the time is right for change. Covid has led to a '
            'deeper awareness of our interdependence as a society; we’ve '
            'learned to value people whose work we took for granted: hospital '
            'teams, men and women who fill the shelves in the shops, keep the '
            'buses on the road and collect our rubbish. We’ve been vividly '
            'presented with the interconnectedness of the fate of humanity '
            'across the globe. We’ve experienced more closely than before our '
            'interconnectedness and interdependence with nature. These are '
            'learnings we cannot afford to squander. Faith leaders will be '
            'strongly represented at Cop26; Pope Francis himself will be '
            'attending. We will be working together across our religions, '
            'determined to live by our values and tell truth to power. We are '

{'article': 'There were always going to be boos from one end of the ground or '
            'the other and, as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side pulled off another '
            'of those increasingly familiar job-saving victories, they came '
            'from Spurs fans. At half-time, at full time and, probably most '
            'significantly, when Lucas Moura was taken off for Steven '
            'Bergwijn. By the end there were chants against the chairman, '
            'Daniel Levy. Saturday’s defeat proved to be the last of Nuno '
            'Espírito Santo’s short reign as Spurs manager as Levy took '
            'decisive action. Manchester United were more solid than they have '
            'been. There may be problems ahead if Marcus Rashford, Mason '
            'Greenwood, Jadon Sancho and Paul Pogba have to go without regular '
            'football for a protracted spell, but for now the 3-4-1-2 has '
            'brought short-term relief. Solskjær at least has the fallback of '
            'good players who can do brilliant things – Nuno was not so '
            'fortunate.\n'
            'With the exception of Son Heung-min – and, being generous, '
            'Pierre-Emile Højbjerg – nobody at Spurs is playing well at the '
            'moment. There is nobody in this side who one can really imagine '
            'being part of a successful Tottenham team in two or three years’ '
            'time. Everybody, from Harry Kane to Eric Dier, from Dele Alli to '
            'Cristian Romero, seems not quite what he used to be. This is what '
            'happens when a squad goes stale en masse. Even Nuno appeared '
            'diminished, the sage of Molineux turned into something altogether '
            'damper. The reserve that seems like intelligent restraint when '
            'things are going well can quickly come to seem ineffectual when '
            'results and performances go awry. And as everything declines, the '
            'poverty of the team and its football is only highlighted by the '
            'magnificence of the surroundings. Spurs have one of the greatest '
            'stadiums in the world; all it cost them was the team. In that '
            'sense, the fury at Levy is understandable. Future generations of '
            'Tottenham fans may have cause to be extremely grateful to him – '
            'without excess spending, he has provided the infrastructure for '
            'Tottenham to be a great club. But they may equally come to regard '
            'him as an eccentric who built a magnificent garage with every '
            'conceivable amenity and then chose to house within it only a '
            'rusted old jalopy. This generation, certainly, is entitled to '
            'feel frustrated. It is not even a case of wondering whether the '
            'cost was too great: could they maybe have scaled back on the '
            'luxury and bought a midfielder? There is also now the sense that, '
            'on top of the economic gamble the club took, as well as having to '
            'suffer some shortfall of investment on the playing side to '
            'achieve the new stadium, a series of bad decisions have been '
            'made.\n'
            'It was not just in those final couple of years under Mauricio '
            'Pochettino that there was a lack of expenditure on players: it '
            'was that too few players were sold. Entropy is the curse against '
            'which all managers must constantly fight: if the manager is to '
            'establish a dynasty, if he is to defy Bela Guttmann’s Three-Year '
            'Rule, there has to be constant rejuvenation. That is perhaps '
            'particularly true of managers who demand the intensity that '
            'Pochettino does (which is why he is such a curious fit for Paris '
            'Saint-Germain). The model there, perhaps, different as their '
            'football may be, is his fellow Argentinian Diego Simeone, now in '
            'his 11th season at Atlético Madrid, thanks at least in part to a '
            'capacity for offloading players at the right time (often bringing '
            'them back once they’ve been refreshed and come to appreciate the '
            'value of his demanding style). That process was never enacted. '
            'Perhaps the club was wary of offloading players who had made them '
            'seem worthy of the new stadium. Perhaps there were few buyers. '
            'Perhaps the focus on the stadium was a distraction. Perhaps '
            'Levy’s notoriously tough bargaining was to blame. But whatever '
            'the reason, the result was stagnation. Even then the situation '
            'was soluble. Even with the financial hit of the pandemic, and the '
            'gleaming new arena sitting empty, Pochettino had credit in the '
            'bank. He could have been given time to reconstruct his squad. But '
            'instead Levy made his gravest error: he not merely dismissed '
            'Pochettino, he also appointed José Mourinho, a decision that '
            'looks increasingly inexplicable with hindsight, as though he felt '
            'the need to act like a big club by appointing a big-club manager. '
            'There were only three problems: Mourinho is not a man to build on '
            'a limited budget, his best days were at least a decade in the '
            'past, and a big-club manager comes with a big-club cost. The '
            'consequence is the current malaise: a squad whose morale is '
            'broken, in a first-rate stadium that offers a constant reminder '
            'that only two years ago Tottenham were in the Champions League '
            'final. Nuno’s ill-fated appointment – everybody knows he was '
            'nowhere near Spurs’ first choice – has also undermined faith in '
            'the sporting director, Fabio Paratici.\n'
            'Underlying all of that is the status anxiety that seemed to '
            'underlie the reluctance seriously to contemplate selling Kane – a '
            'symbol of big-clubdom – the fee for whom could have begun the '
            'process of rejuvenation. That is assuming Paratici could have '
            'been trusted to spend it well – he may have been serenaded by the '
            'fans on his arrival but his early record does little to inspire '
            'confidence. Getting rid of Nuno leaves Spurs back in the position '
            'they were in six months ago when Mourinho was dismissed. This '
            'crisis is far deeper rooted than that. • This article was '

            'London. In 2018, the Irish restaurateur JP McMahon called '
            'avocados the “blood diamonds of Mexico”; he has developed a '
            'guacamole alternative made using jerusalem artichokes. This trend '
            'is not confined to the restaurant industry. Last month, the '
            'TikTok star Calum Harris (AKA @madebyblitz) garnered 371,000 '
            'likes on his recipe for “guacamole” made with frozen peas, while, '
            'on Instagram, the hashtag #noavocado has 3,220 posts and '
            'counting.\n'
            '“A few years ago, I was quite well known for my use of avocados '
            'in my cooking – so much so that I dedicated a whole Instagram '
            'account (@avodaily) to my love for them,” says the vegan cookery '
            'writer Bettina Campolucci Bordi. She decided to cut back when she '
            'moved to the UK, having previously lived in Spain, where she '
            'could source avocados locally. “My favourite recipe to date uses '
            'British peas instead. I blanche the peas before crushing them and '
            'mixing them with plant-based sour cream, salt and pepper, a '
            'little grated garlic and a spritz of lemon juice.”\n'
            'Wahaca’s decision to offer an alternative to guacamole is perhaps '
            'the clearest indication to date that “parts of the food industry '
            'are beginning to wake up to the enormity of the issues we face as '
            'a result of intensive farming”, says Tim Lang, a professor of '
            'food policy at City, University of London. Avocados have become a '
            '“global commodity crop”, he says, the perfect example of what '
            'happens when “an exotic food becomes normalised with no thinking '
            'through of the consequences”. Problems including deforestation, '
            'loss of biodiversity, and water shortages mean that “the '
            'communities growing them do not have enough water for washing and '
            'hygiene”, adds Lang. But avocados are challenging to replace – as '
            'are their derivatives, avocado oil and avocado butter, which are '
            'important in gluten-free and vegan baking. Plus, for many fans of '
            'the fruit, a dip made from beans, nuts, seeds or vegetables is no '
            'more a replacement for guacamole than smashed broad beans on '
            'toast (as suggested by Tom Hunt’s recipe for not-avocado on '
            'toast) is an alternative to smashed avocado. Perhaps anticipating '
            'this complaint, Wahaca has said that “a traditional, freshly made '
            'guacamole” will remain on its menu, for which all of its avocados '
            'are “sourced at the most sustainable levels possible”.\n'
            'Miers, who worked with the British pulse grower Hodmedod’s to '
            'create Wahacamole, says: “The fact that we can grow [fava beans '
            'in the UK] using regenerative farming methods that fix both '
            'nitrogen and carbon into our soil is an added boon.” While '
            'guacamole swaps may not exactly replicate the taste of avocado, '
            'the feedback has been good at Wahaca. “We’ve been giving people '
            'Wahacamole to try for free when they come in to dine with us – '
            'and on the whole they seem genuinely interested in giving it a '
            'go. Most are enjoying it and many are ordering more,” says Miers. '
            'Lastra says: “We were looking not to recreate, but to produce a '
            'similar sensorial experience. What does an avocado mean in terms '
            'of sight, texture, aroma and flavour? And how do we paint that '
            'with the tools we have?” His blend of pistachios, pine oil, '
            'cucumber juice and fermented gooseberries may not fool an avocado '
            'connoisseur, but Lastra tells me most people “can’t actually tell '
            'the difference … they really enjoy it”. It has all the '
            'creaminess, tang and colour of traditional guacamole, he says – '
            'and it doesn’t look bad on Instagram, either.',

{'article': 'Scott Morrison has hit back against an extraordinary accusation '
            'from the French president that Australia’s prime minister lied to '
            'him over an abandoned $90bn submarine contract, declaring he will '
            'not “cop sledging” about Australia’s integrity. Speaking to '
            'reporters in Glasgow where he is attending the UN climate '
            'conference Cop26, Morrison said Emmanuel Macron was well aware '
            'that Australia was contemplating pulling out of the troubled '
            'Naval Group diesel submarine contract. Morrison said he was as '
            'transparent as possible with the French president that '
            'diesel-powered submarines were not going to meet Australia’s '
            'capability needs.\n'
            'Morrison said he did not wish to “personalise” his rebuttal of '
            'Macron’s allegation, delivered on the sidelines of the G20 summit '
            'in Rome. Australia’s prime minister said he had “broad '
            'shoulders”, but he did not intend to take “slurs” about '
            'Australia’s national integrity. “I’ve got broad shoulders, I can '
            'deal with that. But those slurs, I’m not going to cop sledging of '
            'Australia, I’m not going to cop that on behalf of Australians. “I '
            'can deal with whatever people throw at me. But Australia has a '
            'proud record when it comes to our defence capability.”\n'
            'Macron’s target was clearly Morrison when he fired a broadside at '
            'his Australian counterpart in Rome, with the French president '
            'saying he had a lot of “respect and friendship” for Australia and '
            'Australians. A visibly furious Morrison had been blindsided by '
            'Macron’s impromptu remarks at the conclusion of the G20 meeting '
            'in Rome on Sunday night. In an exercise in damage control, text '
            'messages from the French president were leaked to some Australian '
            'media outlets. One leaked Macron text two days before Australia '
            'cancelled the Naval group contract and unveiled the Aukus pact '
            'with the United States and Britain had the president asking '
            'Australia’s prime minister: “Should I expect good or bad news for '
            'our joint submarines ambitions?” But the leaked message shared to '
            'reinforce Australia’s position confirmed that Macron did not know '
            'which way Australia would go on the eve of the Aukus pact being '
            'announced. Morrison was asked on Monday why Macron’s private '
            'messages had been leaked. The prime minister said he didn’t '
            'intend to “indulge your editorial on that”. He insisted that '
            'Macron’s claim to have been blindsided by the cancellation of the '
            'contract was contradicted by France’s own actions after the two '
            'leaders dined at the Elysee Palace after a G7 summit in the '
            'middle of the year.\n'
            'Morrison says he conveyed Australia’s significant hesitations '
            'about the Naval Group contract at that point. But he said he was '
            'not at that time in a position to be entirely candid with Macron '
            'about his plan to acquire nuclear submarines through the Aukus '
            'pact. “The suggestion that these things were not raised [with '
            'Macron] does not gel with the way the French defence system flew '
            'into action the very next day [after the dinner in Paris],” '
            'Morrison said. He noted a French admiral had been sent to '
            'Australia to “try and save the contract after our dinner in '
            'Elysee”. Morrison said France would not have launched a rearguard '
            'action to save the multibillion dollar deal on that scale “if '
            'there was no concern about the contract being under threat”. '
            'Morrison said he also tried to give Macron a heads-up about the '
            'Aukus pact before it was unveiled publicly, but the French '
            'president wasn’t available to take a call. Morrison said he then '
            'texted Macron to say it was important that the two leaders spoke. '
            'Asked whether Macron – an important ally – deserved better than a '
            'last minute heads up, Morrison said: “This was a highly secure '
            'decision, a highly secure environment over which we had held '
            'these things incredibly tightly … for more than a year.” '
            '“[Macron] was clearly aware over some months that there were '
            'concerns, and they were responding to those concerns, and we had '
            'correspondence and other messaging during the course of that '
            'period,” the prime minister said. “We decided in Australia’s '
            'interests not to go ahead with the [Naval Group] contract,” he '
            'said. “There was a contract, it had a gate, and that gate should '
            'have actually been passed through last December.” “Delays in the '
            'contract meant that didn’t occur and that it extended out well '
            'into July. We had not made a decision, which [France] would have '
            'been very well aware of, we had still not made a decision on the '
            'scope two works, and they were seeking to respond to that. “But '
            'at the end of the day, I am going to take the tough decisions to '
            'ensure Australia has the best defence capability.” Morrison eased '
            'around a question about whether France had offered to supply '
            'Australia with nuclear submarines as an alternative. He told '
            'reporters in Glasgow Australia wasn’t interested in that option. '
            'He also declined to answer a question about whether he had failed '
            'to tell Macron about the Aukus discussion because the Biden '
            'administration had sought total secrecy. Morrison has faced '
            'public opprobrium about his conduct during the submarine fracas '
            'not only from Macron, but also from the US president Joe Biden. '
            'Shortly after Morrison arrived in Italy for the G20, Biden moved '
            'to repair his own damaged personal and political relationship '
            'with Macron by acknowledging that the Aukus announcement had been '
            'a “clumsy” episode handled with a lack of grace. Biden told '
            'Macron with television cameras present that he was “under the '
            'impression that France had been informed” about Australia’s '
            'intention to ditch the contract “long before” the Aukus pact was '
            'revealed publicly. It was unclear whether the US president was '
            'rebuking Morrison, or his own senior staff for failing to keep '
            'him abreast of the nuances.',

{'article': 'Barclays’ chief executive, Jes Staley, has stepped down after an '
            'investigation by the City watchdog over how he described his '
            'links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey '
            'Epstein. The bank said its board reached an agreement over '
            'Staley’s resignation after being notified on Friday of the '
            'preliminary conclusions in an investigation by the Financial '
            'Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority '
            'into how Staley had characterised his relationship with Epstein '
            'to Barclays. The investigation, which began in late 2019, also '
            'considered the way Barclays subsequently described that '
            'relationship to the FCA, which covers conduct related issues in '
            'the City.\n'
            'The inquiry was launched after emails between Staley and Epstein '
            'were handed to UK regulators by their counterparts in the US. The '
            'outgoing chief executive plans to challenge the investigation’s '
            'findings. Depending on the outcome of his challenge, it could '
            'delay or ultimately block regulators from issuing potential fines '
            'and penalties, as well as releasing the investigation’s findings '
            'to the public. “In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley’s '
            'intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed '
            'that he will step down from his role as group chief executive and '
            'as a director of Barclays,” Barclays said in a statement on '
            'Monday morning. “The board is disappointed at this outcome. Mr '
            'Staley has run the Barclays Group successfully since December '
            '2015 with real commitment and skill.” Staley will be replaced by '
            'Barclays’ head of global markets, CS Venkatakrishnan, with '
            'immediate effect. In an internal memo to staff seen by the '
            'Guardian, Staley said: “The reasons for my decision are simple. '
            'The FCA and PRA let me know on Friday evening the draft '
            'conclusions of their investigation into the characterisation of a '
            'professional relationship I developed earlier in my career. I do '
            'not want my personal response to those matters to be a '
            'distraction from the fantastic work you do every day to support '
            'our customers and clients.” The bank said the investigation did '
            'not conclude that Staley “saw, or was aware of, any of Mr '
            'Epstein’s alleged crimes, which was the central question '
            'underpinning Barclays’ support for Mr Staley following the arrest '
            'of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019”. The FCA and PRA said in a '
            'joint statement that they “do not comment on ongoing '
            'investigations or regulatory proceedings beyond confirming the '
            'regulatory actions as detailed in the firm’s announcement”. '
            'Staley – who joined Barclays in 2015 – has previously said that '
            'he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000 while working at '
            'JP Morgan, where Epstein had already been a client. Staley stayed '
            'in contact with Epstein for seven years after the financier was '
            'convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, and '
            'visited Epstein in Florida while the financier was still serving '
            'his sentence and out on work release in 2009. Staley said their '
            'relationship tapered off after he left JP Morgan. His final visit '
            'involved sailing his yacht to Epstein’s private island in 2015. '
            'It is not clear why Staley decided to cut ties with the former '
            'banking client. Despite his resignation, Staley will still be '
            'paid his full £2.4m salary, £120,000 pension allowance and other '
            'benefits, including medical cover and life assurance over the '
            'next 12 months. The American banker will also be eligible for '
            'relocation costs if he chooses to move back to the US. However, '
            'the bank said no decision has yet been made in regard to further '
            'payments, which include bonuses or clawbacks. It is understood '
            'that those decisions are likely to hinge on the final findings of '
            'the FCA and PRA’s investigation. The outgoing boss was paid £4m '
            'for 2020, including an annual bonus worth £843,000. However, he '
            'donated about £392,000 of that total to the bank’s Covid fund. '
            'Barclays shares fell 2% to 198p, making it one of the '
            'worst-performing stocks on the FTSE 100 on Monday morning, '
            'although they later recovered to close just 0.7% down at 201p. '
            'New boss for Barclays Barclays has chosen CS Venkatakrishnan – '
            'also known as Venkat – to take over as chief executive with '
            'immediate effect. The bank’s board said it had been working on a '
            'succession plan “for some time” and had identified '
            'Venkatakrishnan as its preferred candidate more than a year ago, '
            'resulting in his move from chief risk officer to head of global '
            'markets in autumn 2020. The new boss – who, like Staley, also '
            'joined Barclays after a career at JP Morgan – will earn a higher '
            'annual salary than his predecessor, worth £2.7m, a sum that will '
            'be split equally into cash and shares subject to a five-year '
            'holding period. He will also be paid £135,000 in lieu of pension, '
            'receive medical and life assurance benefits and an annual bonus '
            'worth up to 93% – or £2.5m – of his fixed pay.\n'
            'A long-term incentive plan will also give the new boss a chance '
            'to earn up to 140% of his fixed pay in any one year, a sum that '
            'would currently be worth about £3.8m. Barclays said it had “long '
            'been confident in Venkat’s capabilities to run Barclays Group”. '
            '“The board is confident that Barclays under his leadership will '
            'continue its strategic direction and improve performance in line '
            'with the progress of recent years,” it added.',

            'viewed with scepticism – a clever concept, but not guaranteed to '

            'ritual: bets are placed at a World Health Organization meeting on '
            'which flu strains will dominate the following winter. There are '
            'four influenza viruses in circulation, each rapidly evolving so '
            'that the previous year’s vaccines will have lost efficacy. '
            'Manufacturers need at least six months to produce vaccines, a '

            'millions of chicken eggs. When the flu forecast is on target, '
            'vaccines can be 60% effective, but a mismatch between vaccines '
            'and circulating strains can result in efficacy as low as 10%. The '

            'which protects against the virus that causes most cervical '
            'cancers, already averts thousands of cases of cancer each year. '
            'In future, scientists hope that mRNA vaccines could be used to '
            'vaccinate against cancer itself by teaching the immune system to '
            'recognise mutations before they occur, in an entirely new '
            'approach to treatment. “We’re taking advantage of the known '
            'genetic progression of cancer,” said Prof Herbert Kim Lyerly, who '
            'is working on cancer vaccine technology at Duke University. His '
            'team plans to trial an mRNA vaccine next year in patients with '
            'late-stage breast cancer, where tumours typically evolve to be '
            'unresponsive to drugs by acquiring mutations in specific genes. '
            'Again, an advantage of mRNA is the ability to hit multiple '
            'targets at once – in this case, a handful of potential mutations. '
            '“There’s no better surgeon in the world than your immune system '
            'to pick off those [mutated cells] in the early stage,” said '
            'Lyerly. The first applications, if successful, could extend a '
            'patient’s life by months by keeping cancer at bay for longer. '
            'Eventually it may be possible to prevent cancer in certain '
            'high-risk populations such as heavy smokers, where a mutation in '
            'a gene called KRAS accounts for up to a quarter of cancers. '
            'Malaria In October the WHO approved the first rollout of a '
            'malaria vaccine. But there is scope for improvement, with the '
            'RTS,S vaccine reducing severe malaria by 30%. A fundamental '
            'challenge is that the malaria parasite has evolved a way of '
            'preventing immunologic memory. Even after catching malaria, let '
            'alone being vaccinated, people remain susceptible to reinfection, '
            'and the disease kills 500,000 people annually, mostly babies and '
            'children. In 2012, Prof Richard Bucala, of Yale School of '
            'Medicine, and colleagues discovered that malaria induced this '
            '“immune system amnesia” using a protein called PMIF, which kills '
            'memory T-cells. Bucala is working on a form of RNA vaccine that '
            'would immunise against PMIF. Studies in mice suggest that '
            'blocking the protein allows the immune system to clear malaria '
            'quicker, resulting in milder illness and, crucially, future '
            'immunity. Bucala has teamed up with scientists at Oxford’s Jenner '
            'Vaccine Institute to test the candidate, and if results are '
            'positive they hope to begin human trials next year. “Vaccines are '
            'desperately needed in the developing world for parasitic diseases '
            'that have long depressed economic and societal development of '
            'many countries,” said Bucala. “RNA has not only enabled the '
            'success of our PMIF vaccine but the platform is far less '
            'expensive than protein-based vaccines, opening opportunities for '
            'a malaria vaccine that have not previously existed.” HIV “We’re '
            'going into the fifth decade now of a global pandemic for HIV,” '
            'said Derek Cain, of Duke University’s Human Vaccine Institute. So '
            'far, a vaccine has remained out of reach. Cain’s team has focused '
            'on a subset of HIV patients (fewer than one-third) who eventually '
            'develop specialised antibodies that can neutralise HIV years '
            'after infection. By this time there is a huge reservoir of virus '
            'in the body, and it is too late to clear the infection. “It’s '
            'like you find a fire extinguisher but the whole house is on fire '
            'already,” said Cain. However, if a vaccine could induce these '
            'antibodies, the hope is that they could extinguish HIV before it '
            'takes hold. Cain and colleagues have meticulously mapped out the '
            'circuitous route taken by the immune system to create these '
            'highly specialised antibodies, and as part of a consortium they '
            'are concocting a sequence of four or five multi-target mRNA '
            'vaccines designed to “recreate the arms race between the immune '
            'system and the pathogen”. “We certainly think that an HIV vaccine '
            'will be far and away the most complicated vaccine that we’ve ever '
            'had to put into the population,” said Cain. “We don’t expect it '
            'to work 100% or 90% like the Covid vaccines, but even if we can '
            'get to 50-60% that would be a success; 70% would be amazing.”',

{'article': 'UK diesel prices have reached a record high at the pumps a week '
            'after petrol prices hit their highest ever level, in a blow to '
            'hard-hit households and small businesses. About 12.5 million '
            'diesel-car drivers faced an average price across the UK of '
            '147.94p a litre on 31 October, narrowly surpassing the previous '
            'high of 147.93p set on 12 April 2012. Diesel prices have risen by '
            '30p a litre over the past year, driven higher by a sharp rebound '
            'in global oil markets, making a full 55-litre tank £16 more '
            'expensive. A 55-litre tank of diesel will now cost about £81, up '
            'from £65 a year ago, according to the motoring group RAC.\n'
            'The record pump price for diesel came one week after the average '
            'daily price for a litre of petrol reached a record 142.94p, in '
            'what was described as a “truly dark day for drivers”. Businesses '
            'in particular are expected to bear the brunt of the record diesel '
            'prices, according to the RAC. The UK has 4.5m vans, most of which '
            'run on diesel, and 525,000 heavy goods vehicles. Simon Williams, '
            'a spokesperson for RAC, said although the new record was expected '
            'after the historic petrol price highs, it was “still another body '
            'blow to drivers and businesses across the country who were '
            'already struggling to cope with rising prices”. “As well as '
            'hitting household budgets this will have a knock-on effect on the '
            'price we pay for goods and services, as diesel is very much the '
            'fuel of business and, as such, will contribute further to '
            'inflation,” he added. Fears over a cost of living crisis this '
            'winter have kept a lid on fuel duty. In last week’s autumn budget '
            'statement, Rishi Sunak scrapped plans to introduce a 2.84p hike '
            'in fuel duty that was expected to cost drivers up to an extra £66 '
            'a car each year.\n'
            'Pump prices have climbed steadily in line with global oil market '
            'prices, which have more than doubled from about $40 (£29) a '
            'barrel a year ago to about $85 in recent weeks because of a '
            'sudden rise in post-pandemic energy demand. “While the price of '
            'diesel on the forecourt has primarily shot up due the cost of a '
            'barrel of oil doubling in the last year from about $40 to more '
            'than $80, the price of biodiesel is now two-and-a-half times what '
            'it was 12 months ago,” Williams said. The global energy supply '
            'crisis has also caused gas markets to rocket to record highs, '
            'which could lead to historic winter heating bills. Squeezed '
            'suppliers have been hit by soaring wholesale prices, while the '
            'amount they can charge consumers is limited by the energy cap. On '
            'Monday, Bluegreen Energy, which has 5,900 domestic customers, '
            'became the 15th supplier to collapse since early August. The '
            'government hopes to break the UK’s reliance on gas boilers by '
            'offering £5,000 grants to help homes switch to electric heat '
            'pumps. But Chris O’Shea, the boss of the British Gas owner '
            'Centrica, warned that another 40,000 heating engineers would be '
            'needed to meet the government’s ambition to retrofit millions of '
            'homes over the next decade. “We do have a real shortage,” he told '
            'a side event at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Global oil '
            'prices are expected to continue to rise this year, and many banks '
            'have raised their market price forecasts to between $90 and $100 '
            'a barrel. Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of US '
            'investment giant BlackRock, said last week: “We’re looking at a '
            'high probability of $100 oil.”',

{'article': 'France’s seafood sector is divided over government sanctions on '
            'British trawlers due to start on Tuesday, with processing '
            'companies warning they will cost jobs but fishers insisting that '
            'after 10 months waiting for UK permits, tough action is needed. '
            'Paris has said it could ban British trawlers from unloading in '
            'French ports, carry out extra licence checks on boats, tighten '
            'checks on trucks and reinforce customs and hygiene controls '
            'unless London grants more licences to fish in UK waters. But the '
            'head of the fish wholesale association in Boulogne, France’s '
            'largest fishing port, said the planned measures were “excessive” '
            'and “disproportionate”, warning they risked doing more harm to '
            'the sector overall than good. “Our processing businesses '
            'absolutely need British products, which represent about 25-30% of '
            'our deliveries,” Aymeric Chrzan told French radio, adding that '
            'France imported more seafood from the UK than is sold in French '
            'fish markets. “The stake as are high for the whole fisheries '
            'sector – not just the wholesalers but the processing and salting '
            'companies,” Chrzan said, warning that up to 1,500 fish and '
            'seafood sector jobs out of a total of 5,000 in Boulogne could be '
            'at risk. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Monday '
            'that France had 48 hours to back down or the UK would begin '
            'dispute talks. President Emmanuel Macron said the ball was in '
            'Britain’s court and that France had tabled concrete de-escalation '
            'proposals. Chrzan said the sanctions would lead to “delays at the '
            'very least. Since we work with fresh fish and just-in-time '
            'deliveries, any hold-ups can be catastrophic.” He said, however, '
            'that Britain should “respect its commitments” under the Brexit '
            'deal. “We need a measured response and rapid solutions in both '
            'countries’ interests,” he said. Arnaud Delegorge, the managing '
            'director of one processing company, Marine SAS, told local media '
            'his firm processed 7,000 tonnes of Scottish salmon each year. “Of '
            'course we will suffer if the planned sanctions are implemented,” '
            'he said. “If we stop British fish entering the French market we '
            'will really be shooting ourselves in the foot – we’re talking '
            'thousands of jobs here.” However, Olivier Lepretre, the head of '
            'the Hauts-de-France regional fishers association, said his '
            'members had requested 80 licences to fish in UK waters but had so '
            'far been granted 35. “Some have seen their incomes fall by up to '
            '50%,” he said. Lepretre said those businesses concerned “will be '
            'in seriously difficulty very quickly. We need a solution, '
            'urgently. It’s a real problem. These boats are confined to French '
            'waters which as a result now risk being overfished.” Fishers '
            '“really don’t care about the politics”, he said. “They just want '
            'to work, to go to sea. But they’re reaching the end of their '
            'tether now, because we’ve been waiting for 10 months. Unless '
            'something gives, some are going to go under.” One Boulogne fisher '
            'who asked not to be named told French television: “After all this '
            'time, we need concrete steps. I’ve invested €3m in my boat and I '
            'need to be able to work properly. There’s been enough blah-blah – '
            'we want results.”',

{'article': 'Just around the corner from where the Krays used to hold sway in '
            'east London’s Brick Lane there is an establishment called '
            'Alcotraz. Described as “London’s first immersive theatrical '
            'cocktail bar”, Alcotraz allows you to dress up in a prison '
            'uniform, get locked up in a cell, have a cocktail or two, and get '
            'your photo taken. So Britain is channelling – in the cause of '
            'entertainment – a famous prison in the United States. But look '
            'closely and you’ll see that we are also mirroring that country’s '
            'relentlessly unforgiving and counterproductive penal policy. '
            'Earlier this year, the prime minister joked that Britain was now '
            '“probably the Saudi Arabia of penal policy, under our wonderful '
            'home secretary”. In October, the Prison Reform Trust published a '
            'report which showed that there had been a “dramatic” increase in '
            'the number of people serving long prison sentences, with far more '
            'people now serving very lengthy terms. Nearly 11,000 people in '
            'prison in England and Wales will spend at least 10 years in '
            'custody. More than two-thirds of them are serving indeterminate '
            'sentences and do not know when – or if – they will be released. '
            'Prison numbers will also inevitably increase if the police, '
            'crime, sentencing and courts bill becomes law. The bill creates '
            'new offences that will essentially criminalise the lifestyles of '
            'Gypsies and Travellers and bump up the overall prison population '
            'with increased sentences for protesters. The new nationality and '
            'borders bill means that those arriving in Britain illegally could '
            'now be jailed for up to four years. In addition, a growing number '
            'of people on parole are being recalled to prison on the basis of '
            'dubious information as the probation service stumbles to recover '
            'from the then justice secretary Chris Grayling’s disastrous '
            'decision to privatise parts of it in 2014. On 21 October, Kevin '
            'Lane, one of those wrongly recalled and only recently released '
            'from prison, held a rally in front of the House of Commons to '
            'draw attention to this scandal. “The landings are full of people '
            'who should be on parole but are back in prison,” he said.\n'
            'The whole criminal justice system is in a chaotic state, partly – '
            'but far from entirely – because of Covid-19. Of the 320 '
            'magistrates courts that existed in England and Wales in 2010, 164 '
            'have been sold off to developers for a total of £223m and turned '
            'into hotels and apartments. In Scotland, 17 sheriff and justice '
            'of the peace courts were sold off or closed in the past decade. '
            'All of which makes it harder for lawyers, members of the public – '
            'and reporters – to attend courts and see what sort of sentences '
            'are being handed down. September’s justice committee report '
            'suggested that as many as 70% of prisoners in England and Wales '
            'may have mental health issues. During Covid lockdowns many of us '
            'talked of being “stir-crazy”. For prisoners, often confined to '
            'their cells for 23 hours a day and heavily restricted from '
            'learning new skills or studying because of staff shortages, being '
            'driven crazy is now a daily reality. There is also a drugs '
            'epidemic inside, with “spice” – with all its wild and dangerous '
            'side-effects – widely available. In Scotland, which at least has '
            'a government more conscious of the problems of drug-related '
            'crime, the prison population is also surging. The number of those '
            'behind bars has risen sharply to an annual average of around '
            '8,200 in 2019-2020. According to the Howard League Scotland, '
            'around a quarter of those inside are awaiting trial and have not '
            'yet been convicted. Maybe the owners of Alcotraz will not be able '
            'to resist opening something called Bar Linnie in Glasgow for '
            'anyone else anxious for that “epic yet intimate” cocktail '
            'experience. Britain currently leads its western European '
            'neighbours in terms of inmates per head of population. England '
            'and Wales jail 138 of their population per 100,000; Scotland 147. '
            'Compare that with 76 in Germany and 59 in the Netherlands and '
            'Norway. Even Spain (123), Italy (101) and France (105) lag behind '
            'us. Maybe not quite “world-beaters” yet but at least we can '
            'defeat those pesky Europeans at something. But where – as many '
            'have asked about the response to the recent report on the '
            'government’s early failings over Covid-19 – is the anger? In '
            '1910, a young home secretary, Winston Churchill, the same one our '
            'current prime minister bases himself upon, said that “the mood '
            'and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and '
            'criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation '
            'of any country”. It’s a test this country is now shamefully '

            'now, and every couple of days it catches my eye, a strange '
            'souvenir from the summer, and hints at what to cook. Although not '
            'the souvenir, but rather something bought from Marco on Testaccio '
            'market, who grows and sells different varieties of pumpkins and '
            'squashes (all of which he calls zucca) that sit like people on a '
            'bench on the shelf at the back of his stall. There seems no '
            'urgency about pumpkins and squashes. It’s as if they know their '
            'longevity, that they will be great the next day or in two months, '
            'so they can sit back while other more desperate vegetables vie '
            'for attention. All that changes when they are cut and flash their '
            'orange insides – then they do demand attention. Whether that’s '
            'sliced and baked, or made into soup or a puree, or stirred into a '
            'risotto or fried for caponata. Caponata, the agrodolce Sicilian '
            'dish, is most commonly made with aubergine as the main element, '
            'supported by celery, onion, tomato, capers, olives, sugar and '
            'vinegar (plus variations). Traditionally, it was a summer dish, a '
            'way of enjoying and dealing with the abundance of aubergines. My '
            'Sicilian mother-in-law, whose parents were farmers on the south '
            'coast and grew aubergines, talks of how caponata was a persistent '
            'presence in the summer. Also of how, as summer drew to an end, '
            'her mother would add enough sugar and vinegar that it became a '
            'dark, demanding relish and could last into autumn. The caponata '
            'principle does not end with summer, though, because aubergines, '
            'like most things, are available all the time these days, and also '
            'because there is a caponata for all seasons: aubergines are '
            'replaced by apples or pears in winter, artichokes in spring, and '
            'pumpkins or squashes in autumn. The singularity of aubergines '
            'lies in the way they become rich and velvety when fried. Squash '
            'and pumpkin are more silky, but much denser, which makes for a '
            'different but still brilliant dish, and the celery feels even '
            'more essential here. A summer souvenir adapted for autumn, '
            'butternut caponata fits in almost everywhere, but is especially '
            'good with sausages. Ours is still on top of the cupboard. Pumpkin '

{'article': 'In February 2020, Amy had plans to go on holiday to the UK to '
            'visit friends. Originally from the US, she was living in Tbilisi, '
            'Georgia, teaching English to Chinese students. At the last '
            'minute, she pulled out of the trip. “I’d heard about the virus '
            'that had started spreading through Europe and decided it might '
            'not be great timing,” she remembers. The same week, she '
            'discovered black mould in her home. “Instead of going on holiday, '
            'I decided to move house.” After finding a new flat, she asked a '
            'friend if she knew anyone who could help her to move. “She said '
            'she knew someone from Iran but he didn’t speak any English.” Amir '
            'had moved to Georgia to buy a home, had bought a van and set up '
            'his own moving business. When he arrived to pack up her boxes, '
            'she was struck by how attractive he was. “He was the most '
            'handsome man I’d ever seen. I hardly knew where to look,” she '
            'says. Because Amir couldn’t speak English, they weren’t able to '
            'communicate on the journey. “Even though we couldn’t talk, I '
            'thought she seemed smart and pretty,” he says. The next day he '
            'texted her to ask her out, using Google Translate to send the '
            'message. They went for dinner and used their phones to '
            'communicate all evening. “We talked about our families and the '
            'reasons we’d come to live in Georgia,” says Amir. Amy admits she '
            'was “being cautious” because of the language barrier. “It kept me '
            'from opening up and getting to know him at first.” But when he '
            'offered to help her unpack and sort out her new flat the next '
            'day, she recognised how kind he was. “That’s when we were able to '
            'get a better feel for each other’s personalities,” she says. “I '
            'could tell he was a good person who would do anything for '
            'anyone.” A month after they started dating, the government '
            'announced that a strict lockdown would soon be coming into force. '
            '“Just before everything shut down, I invited him to move in,” she '
            'says. She continued to teach online, while Amir’s business was '
            'temporarily paused. “I started to teach him some English, but '
            'he’s a very stubborn student,” she laughs. It wasn’t long before '
            'they began discussing marriage. “I was thinking about it from the '
            'start,” says Amir. “She is so smart and independent. She knew '
            'what she wanted from life.” Amy also felt the relationship was '
            'right. “He’s dedicated to me. Even though he couldn’t express '
            'these things with words, I saw it through his actions.”\n'
            'At the end of the lockdown, Amir “asked me through Google '
            'Translate if we could get married”, Amy says. As they were unable '
            'to have guests, they held video calls with both families before '
            'and after the wedding, which took place at the end of May this '
            'year in Georgia. “My family always trusted my decisions and they '
            'were happy for me,” says Amy. Amir also had his family’s '
            'blessing. “I’ve always been able to tell my dad anything and he '
            'supports me.” The couple enjoy doing everything together, from '
            'hiking to yoga. They share a passion for travel and have plans to '
            'visit Japan in the future. In September, they moved into Amir’s '
            'apartment, just outside the city. They’re now planning to return '
            'to Amy’s hometown of Richmond, Virginia. “The government in '
            'Georgia invited people from Iran to live here if they could buy a '
            'home for $35,000, but this rule has now changed and the home must '
            'be worth over $100,000. It means Amir is no longer eligible for '
            'residency, so we’re going back to the States.” Amy loves her '
            'partner’s fidelity and commitment to her. “I told him I wanted a '
            'pet fish and he bought me this amazing aquarium. He has '
            'unquestioning loyalty and will do anything to make me happy. He’s '
            'my best friend.” Meanwhile, Amir appreciates his partner’s caring '
            'nature. “She’s always teaching me about the world. I have a '
            'better understanding of culture, and she’s opened my mind to new '
            'things and new experiences.” Want to share your story? Tell us a '

{'article': 'Amazon forest defenders are urging delegates at Cop26 not to '
            'trust the “greenwashing” promises of Jair Bolsonaro’s government, '
            'which has wreaked havoc on the environment over the past three '
            'years. Brazil will field one of the biggest delegations at the UN '
            'climate talks in Glasgow and fund a lavish promotional pavilion '
            'inside the conference centre. According to the agriculture '
            'minister, Tereza Cristina Corrêa da Costa Dias, and the '
            'environment minister, Joaquim Alvaro Pereira Leite, the message '
            'is that Brazil is “a longtime champion of the environmental '
            'agenda and an agrifood powerhouse”. But climate activists say the '
            'world should pay more attention to the destructive policies of '
            'the recent past than vague promises about the future, which they '
            'say are aimed at securing cash. Suely Vaz, a former head of the '
            'environment regulator Ibama who now works for the Climate '
            'Observatory, said the Brazilian government had gutted forest '
            'protection agencies and tried to change the law in favour of '
            'farmers and land grabbers. “Nowadays Brazil has an '
            'anti-environmental policy. They are paralysing everything. '
            'Deforestation and forest fires are out of control. This must '
            'change to ensure that climate money – which is important for our '
            'country – can be used in very detailed, specified way,” she said. '
            'Carlos Rittl, a senior policy adviser at the Rainforest '
            'Foundation Norway, said Brazil should not get away with a '
            'makeover that aimed to shake its pariah reputation under '
            'Bolsonaro. “It will be the biggest team ever. They are spending a '
            'lot on communications. Agriculture and industry will be there and '
            'a big comms team trying to sell the world a different image. But '
            'the world needs to hold Brazil accountable to the truth. The '
            'satellites don’t lie.” Satellite images show deforestation is at '
            'its highest level since 2012. More than 10,000 square kilometres '
            'were lost in the 12 months to July – an area nearly seven times '
            'bigger than greater London, and an increase of 57% on the '
            'previous year. Scientists say the rainforest is approaching an '
            'irreversible tipping point after which it would degrade into a '
            'dry savannah. Every nation is supposed to come to Glasgow with a '
            'more ambitious climate plan so the world can move closer to the '
            'Paris agreement’s goal of holding global heating as close to 1.5C '
            'as possible. The vast majority of governments have promised '
            'stronger action, but when Brazil updated its national climate '
            'plan last December it weakened its targets and allowed an extra '
            '400 megatonnes of emissions. Climate Action Tracker rated this '
            '“highly insufficient”. Brazil has often proved a key player at '
            'climate talks and its negotiating team is highly respected. Since '
            'Bolsonaro took power, however, the country has become notorious '
            'for nationalist, anti-globalist policies. One of its first acts '
            'was to abandon plans to host the 2019 Cop. At the subsequent '
            'meeting in Madrid, the NGO Climate Action Network presented '
            'Brazil with the “colossal fossil” award for least progressive '
            'country. At Glasgow, Brazil will show a less fractious face. This '
            'is largely due to the shift in Washington. While Donald Trump was '
            'in the White House, Bolsonaro was emboldened to denigrate '
            'international cooperation on the world stage. Since Joe Biden '
            'came to power, he has been forced to drop his two most globally '
            'toxic representatives: the former foreign minister Ernesto '
            'Araújo, and the former environment minister Ricardo Salles. The '
            'new environment minister, Joaquim Leite, who will head the '
            'Brazilian delegation at Glasgow, is far more personable, but '
            'activists say he has done little to change the destructive '
            'policies of his predecessor. At Biden’s climate summit earlier '
            'this year, Bolsonaro promised to meet a goal set by one of his '
            'presidential predecessors, Dilma Rousseff, to halt illegal '
            'deforestation by 2030. But this threatens to become meaningless '
            'because his supporters in Congress are trying to change the law '
            'to allow more legal forest clearance and invasions of indigenous '
            'land, which is usually the best-protected territory. Inside '
            'Brazil, the heat is growing on Bolsonaro, who faces reelection '
            'next year. The economy is weak, his ratings are down and the '
            'senate wants to try him over the country’s 600,000-plus Covid '
            'deaths. Many in the agribusiness sector fear they will lose '
            'markets if the president continues to sully the country’s '
            'overseas image. Some farmers realise the rainfall for their crops '
            'depends on a stable Amazon rainforest. Concessions are possible '
            'at Glasgow. Some observers expect Brazil to announce a green '
            'growth policy, tweak its national climate plan and compromise on '
            'one of the most contentious areas of the climate talks, the '
            '“article 6” debate on a market mechanism for climate action. This '
            'could unlock billions of dollars in carbon credits and other '
            'incentives. A focus of Brazil’s delegation is the potential '
            'market for carbon, methane and conservation credits. These forms '
            'of financial support are intended to protect and restore the '
            'world’s great forests. This is a key goal of the UK hosts, who '
            'hope to announce a deal on Tuesday that would detail measures to '
            'halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, including greater support '
            'for indigenous peoples, moves towards deforestation-free supply '
            'chains, finance and regulations. The EU, Indonesia and the '
            'Democratic Republic of the Congo have agreed to this deal. Brazil '
            'is reportedly yet to sign. Brazil and other developing nations '
            'will also be pushing wealthy countries to finally live up to '
            'their promise of $100bn a year in climate funding between 2020 '
            'and 2025. If approved, the key question is how to ensure the '
            'money is spent on projects that reduce emissions and climate '
            'impacts. The situation is reminiscent of the US under Trump, when '
            'the rest of the world largely ignored the official US delegation '
            'at Cop summits while giving prominent space and attention to a '
            'rival gatherings of state governors, city mayors, NGOs and others '
            'supporting more ambitious emissions cuts. The two very different '
            'sides of Brazil will be similarly present in Glasgow. While the '
            'official Brazilian pavilion will promote agriculture, a rival '
            'Brazil Climate Action hub will highlight the emissions-cutting '
            'efforts of Amazonian states, indigenous communities and civil '
            'society groups.',

{'article': 'Good morning. Leaders representing more than 1 billion of the '

            'of failing poor and vulnerable countries by not agreeing to a '
            'climate plan that would ensure their people’s survival. The '
            'leading figures at the Cop26 climate talks told the Guardian they '
            'were “extremely concerned” and had hoped for more from the G20 '
            'summit in Rome. They said the prospect of limiting global heating '
            'to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a vital threshold that '
            'scientists say is a “planetary boundary”, was slipping away as '
            'the UN conference opened in Glasgow. Gaston Browne, the prime '
            'minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chair of the Alliance of '
            'Small Island States, which represents 39 countries, said: “From '
            'what I’ve seen it appears we are going to overshoot 1.5C. We are '
            'very concerned about that. This is a matter of survival for us.” '
            'He blamed the influence of powerful private-sector interests for '
            'the G20’s failure to come up with better plans, saying: “We are '
            'here to save the planet, not to protect profits.” From the '
            'seemingly inexorable increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere '
            'to the rapid growth in green energy, here’s the climate crisis '
            'explained in 10 charts. How bad are emissions from key polluting '
            'countries? My colleague Miranda Bryant plays “Cop trumps” to find '
            'out who has been taking steps to improve and who really has not. '
            'As an environment writer, Fiona Harvey has seen many setbacks – '

            'and says domestic agenda set to pass\n'
            'Joe Biden sought to brush off concerns about bad polling on '
            'Sunday, telling reporters he expected Democrats to overcome '
            'internal differences and pass his domestic spending plan and a '
            'bipartisan infrastructure deal in the week to come. Earlier, an '
            'NBC News poll found that 54% of US adults disapproved of Biden’s '
            'performance, down six points since August, a period in which the '
            'president’s domestic agenda has stalled amid intra-party '
            'division. Biden spoke to reporters in Rome at the end of the G20, '
            'before traveling to Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit. He '
            'said: “I didn’t run to determine how well I’m going to do in the '

            'Jen Psaki, Joe Biden’s White House press secretary, said on '
            'Sunday she had tested positive for Covid-19. Psaki, 42, did not '

            'outbreak at the White House reached the then president, Donald '
            'Trump, who fell seriously ill and was forced to spend time in '
            'hospital. In a statement, Psaki said she last saw the 78-year-old '
            'Biden on Tuesday, “when we sat outside more than 6ft apart and '
            'wore masks”. Biden tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday, '

            'didn’t she travel to Europe for the G20 and Cop25 talks? Psaki '
            'said she stayed in the US “due to a family emergency, which was '
            'members of my household testing positive for Covid-19”. Has Biden '
            'had a booster shot of the Covid vaccine? Yes, the president got '

{'article': 'A single mother of six children has been waiting four years and '
            'four months to see a consultant for suspected multiple sclerosis '
            'in Northern Ireland as officials admit in leaked court papers '
            'that health waiting lists have spiralled “out of control”. '
            'Although referred to a neurologist in June 2017, Eileen Wilson, '
            '47, has still not received a date to see the specialist despite '
            'suffering choking episodes that leave her “blue in the face”, '
            'loss of muscle control and a multitude of other symptoms. She is '
            'one of the hundreds of thousands of patients suffering in silence '
            'because of the chronic waiting lists that have been building '
            'since 2013, according to testimony submitted to the high court. '
            'Her case is at the centre of two landmark cases to be heard in '
            'December and January against the Northern Ireland health '
            'minister, Robin Swann, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the '
            'health secretary, Savid Javid, who were named as defendants in '
            'the case last week after affidavits from Northern Ireland’s '
            'Department of Health blamed years of underfunding for the crisis. '
            'Sitting in her garden in her army veteran house in Belfast, '
            'Wilson said she would not give up the fight even though the human '
            'rights commission, her GP, and her MP, Gavin Robinson, have all '
            'failed to get her an appointment. “I just want to know what’s '
            'wrong with me,” she says. She explains how she staggers around '
            'her home “like a drunk” even though she does not drink and now '
            'suffers episodes of sleep paralysis, which has been likened to '
            'locked-in syndrome.\n'
            '“When I go to bed all the worry is there, it’s like a washing '
            'machine on full spin,” she said. “I worry that if I fall or '
            'choke, that’s going to be the end of it.” Die? “Yes,” she '
            'answers. “It can happen anytime. It’s like something is stuck in '
            'my throat. I’ve gone blue in the face. It lasts for a few minutes '
            'but it feels like hours,” she said. To her shock, she heard '
            'through her MP that her GP’s referral had been downgraded from '
            '“urgent” to “routine”, with the chief executive of South Eastern '
            'health and social care trust telling Robinson that “regrettably” '
            'the waiting time for an appointment was 163 weeks – three years '
            'and 13 weeks. “I am very sorry that we have not yet been able to '
            'offer Mrs Wilson an appointment,” he said. Four years and four '
            'months later, she is none the wiser. Her solicitor, Ciaran O’Hare '
            'of McIvor Farrell, has already applied successfully for leave for '
            'a judicial review, which is now listed for January with a second '
            'case expedited for hearing in December over a failed bid to get '
            'her an appointment overseas under EU legislation transposed into '
            'domestic law. He said her case was for the “benefit of the people '
            'of Northern Ireland” and is asking the court to conclude that the '
            'waiting lists, the worst in the UK for much of the past decade, '
            'are “unlawful and a breach of human rights”. “This saga has been '
            'going on in Northern Ireland for over 10 years and hospital '
            'waiting lists have been getting longer and longer. We do not have '
            'the NHS here, like in England; we have health and social care and '
            'it doesn’t work,” said O’Hare. “This is the first case of its '
            'kind and it is absolutely crucial because something must be done '
            'to end the suffering that is occurring every single day with '
            'people languishing and dying on hospital waiting lists,” he '
            'added. Recent figures show nearly a fifth of Northern Ireland’s '
            'population are waiting for a first appointment and more than half '
            'of those are waiting for more than a year. “It is the case that '
            'the majority of people on the waiting list are waiting for more '
            'than a year, which is pretty extraordinary,” said Mark Dayan, a '
            'policy analyst at the health services thinktank the Nuffield '
            'Trust. Waiting lists are the worst in the UK and possibly in '
            'Europe. Last week, the children’s commissioner revealed that 24 '
            'children with confirmed or suspected cancer were among the 17,000 '
            'minors waiting more than a year to see a specialist. Affidavits '
            'submitted to the courts and seen by the Guardian paint a grim '
            'picture. A senior official in the Department of Health in his '
            'testimony, said the delays were “extremely regrettable” but the '
            'health minister had repeatedly said a significant increase in '
            'funding was necessary to make a return to acceptable levels. '
            '“While doctors, nurses, other health professionals and managers '
            'have made every effort to ensure that any negative impact on '
            'patients has been kept to a minimum, waiting times have continued '
            'to grow to a level where many believe that they are now out of '
            'control,” he added. Dayan said Northern Ireland’s waiting lists '
            'began to “spiral to more and more unacceptably poor levels '
            'relative to the rest of the UK” 10 years ago. He said “one '
            'year-plus waits” were “almost unheard of” in England before '
            'Covid, but have been “common in Northern Ireland”. Out of an '
            'estimated 460,000 on a waiting list, 250,000 have been on it for '
            'more than a year, he said. The Department of Health declined to '
            'comment due to ongoing court proceedings.',

{'article': 'When Daryl Maguire phoned Gladys Berejiklian in 2018 to tell her '
            'he’d been summonsed to the Independent Commission Against '
            'Corruption did she realise that what she did next might cost her '
            'her career? Did the former New South Wales premier consider that '
            'she might have information gleaned from their five-year secret '
            'relationship that she, as a public official, had a duty to '
            'report? Apparently not. On Monday Berejiklian faced serious '
            'questions about whether she met her obligations the Icac Act to '
            'report “a reasonable suspicion of corrupt conduct” to either Icac '
            'or the head of her department of Premier and cabinet. She did not '
            'contact either, a decision that, depending on what the commission '
            'finds she knew about Maguire’s alleged dealings, could lead to a '
            'finding of a serious breach.\n'
            'Icac guidelines explain reasonable suspicion means “there is a '
            'real possibility that corrupt conduct is, or may be, involved. No '
            'proof is required.” We’ve already heard tapped phone calls of '
            'Maguire telling Berejiklian he hoped to make $1.5m in commissions '
            'out of securing property rezonings at the new airport site at '
            'Badergy’s creek. This was while he was a serving MP in an '
            'electorate 400km from Sydney’s new airport site. Berejiklian has '
            'given evidence this sum did not ring alarm bells for her. She '
            'told Icac she didn’t really believe him. But she was told more '
            'than that, as we learned from phone taps played to the commission '
            'on Friday. On the evening of 5 July 2018 the former MP for Wagga '
            'rang with a bombshell: he had been summonsed as a witness to Icac '
            'over an introduction he had made for a Chinese developer, Country '
            'Garden, to then mayor of Canterbury, Michael Hawatt. An '
            'increasingly alarmed Berejiklian spent the 52-minute call trying '
            'to untangle exactly what Maguire was being called to Icac for. He '
            'told her Icac was interested in an introduction he had made for '
            'Country Garden to a council 400kms from his own electorate. She '
            'commented that the people he was associating with were “dodgy”. '
            'He assured her he was just a witness. He railed against Icac and '
            'said they could be listening now. They were. Monday morning '
            'brought further grilling by counsel assisting Scott Robertson SC '
            'about Berejiklian’s state of mind and her suspicions after that '
            'call.\n'
            'Berejiklian gave evidence she didn’t put two and two together '
            'with anything she had heard over the last three or four years. '
            'She did not “join the dots” about what had been revealed to her '
            'privately about lobbying for rezonings of land at Badgery’s creek '
            'and the Icac probe. She did not suspect corrupt conduct. “I '
            'assumed he had been caught up in something,” she said. Even after '
            'the 5 July call, she didn’t think she needed to inform Icac what '
            'Maguire had just told her because “Icac already knew”. As '
            'commissioner, Ruth McColl pointed out, she didn’t know what Icac '
            'knew or didn’t know. Still she didn’t suspect any corrupt '
            'conduct. “My radar wasn’t going off,” she said. “I trusted him.” '
            'The commission heard that in the days after 5 July, there were '
            'texts and calls in which Maguire urged Berejiklian to get another '
            'private phone and to communicate using the WeChat app, so that '
            'Icac couldn’t read or hear their communications. She suggested '
            'WhatsApp might be easier and said she would try. She did not take '
            'up his advice, and said that she believed his requests were '
            'because of “privacy concerns,” rather than trying to avoid '
            'detection. On 13 July Maguire appeared before Icac in Operation '
            'Dacha and the full extent of his involvement with Canterbury '
            'council became public. That inquiry was played phone taps of '
            'Maguire discussing his plans with business associates to seek '
            'payment for brokering property deals. The inquiry ultimately made '
            'no finding of corrupt conduct against him, but recommended he '
            'face criminal charges for giving false evidence. That evening '
            'Berejiklian phoned her chief of staff, Sarah Cruiksank whom she '
            'described as “a close friend” and highly professional public '
            'servant, to tell her about the secret relationship with Maguire. '
            'Cruikshank has given evidence that she was at dinner when the '
            'call came and did not take notes but she recalled Berejiklian '
            'telling her the relationship was “historical” and had ended when '
            'she became premier in January 2017.\n'
            'Under questioning Cruikshank’s counsel on Monday, Berejiklian '
            'denied she had lied about its status to Cruikshank. “Two people '
            'could have different perceptions of the same conversation,” she '
            'said. Of course, a current relationship would have had very '
            'different political ramifications. Cruikshank, had she known the '
            'relationship was ongoing, would have no doubt swung into full '
            'damage control, telling Icac that if she had known the '
            'relationship was ongoing she would have discussed with '
            'Berejiklian “whether or not there were implications for things '
            'she had done” and told Maguire that Berejiklian should not be '
            'involved in decisions relating to proposals he was lobbying for. '
            'The motivation behind Berejiklian’s obsessive secrecy about the '
            'relationship with Maguire is difficult to fathom. After his '
            'evidence at Icac, she removed him from the ministry and sent him '
            'to the crossbenches, as is protocol. But she made some poor '
            'choices. She did not seek any advice from Cruikshank or a lawyer '
            'on whether she had a duty to report what she knew to Icac, '
            'maintaining that she didn’t have any suspicions. In fact she kept '
            'in contact with him until September 2020. She told Icac that she '
            'was “mortified” after he gave evidence, saying the “shock of what '
            'happened made me question everything” including whether Maguire '
            'might have lied to her.\n'
            'Meanwhile, at least two staff members came forward in the days '

{'article': 'Plans are under way to build the UK’s largest village for rough '
            'sleepers in one of Manchester’s most desirable neighbourhoods. '
            'Embassy Village will provide homes for 40 men in purpose-built '
            'pods underneath 10 railway arches in the Castlefield district, '
            'where one-bedroom flats regularly sell for £250,000. Sandwiched '
            'between the River Irwell and the Bridgewater canal, the land has '
            'been given for free on a 125-year lease by Peel Group, the '
            'developers behind MediaCity and the Manchester Ship Canal. The '
            'village is the brainchild of Sid Williams, founder of a Christian '
            'charity called Embassy. A skinny-jeaned, perma-cheerful '
            'enthusiast, he ran a homeless shelter on Mumford & Sons’ old tour '
            'bus until Covid got in the way. James Whittaker, Peel’s executive '
            'director of development, calls him Jesus, “because you can’t help '
            'but feel the genuine good he’s doing. He’s probably the kindest, '
            'most genuine man I’ve ever met.”\n'
            'Though he would blush at the blasphemous comparison, 36-year-old '
            'Williams has a remarkable knack for getting rich people to dig '
            'into their pockets in his mission to house the homeless and '
            'destitute in Manchester. An estate agent would describe Embassy '
            'Village as “waterside living in a city centre location”. Showing '
            'the Guardian around the site last month, Williams admitted it '
            'currently looks more like “an apocalyptic wasteland”, with water '
            'dripping from two viaducts carrying noisy trams and trains and '
            'some rough sleepers having already set up mattresses among the '
            'detritus of illegal raves. Planning permission was granted this '
            'summer, with 61% of local people in favour of the project. Now '
            'Williams – helped by Tim Heatley, founder of property developer '
            'Capital & Centric and chair of the Greater Manchester mayor’s '
            'homelessness charity – is on a mission to raise £3m to build the '
            'village, offering local corporates a chance to sponsor one or '
            'more homes. Computer-generated simulations of the project show '
            'alfresco dining, festoon lighting and imaginary residents tending '
            'to communal gardens – exactly the sort of aspirational images '
            'sold to wealthy young professionals moving into the skyscrapers '
            'popping up across Manchester. But while they may pay £800 a month '
            'for a one-bed studio, Embassy’s residents are likely to pay no '
            'more than the local housing allowance – currently £302 a month '
            'for a room in a shared house or £552 for a one-bed flat. Embassy '
            'is not providing “forever” homes. Residents can stay for a '
            'maximum of two years. The idea is to “give every resident a live '
            'trial run at managing a home, cooking, cleaning and paying rent '
            'in a sympathetic and supported environment”, said Williams.\n'
            'Running the Embassy bus led Williams to conclude that shelters '
            'are not really the answer to solving rough sleeping. If people '
            'are to get off the streets, they need stable tenancies and '
            'wrap-around support. They also need jobs, which is why Embassy '
            'partners with 18 local businesses who agree to give interviews '
            'and hopefully employment to its tenants. To qualify for residency '
            'in Embassy Village, residents must be men with no alcohol or drug '
            'addictions. (Embassy will soon open a separate, more low-key '
            'project for homeless women fleeing domestic violence.) As well as '
            'paying rent, they must commit to six hours a week of training in '
            'shopping, cooking and budgeting. “I wanted to get away from the '
            'shelter model where you sort of accidentally become a parent, '
            'going, ‘Oh, I’ll do the shopping. And I’ll do the cleaning. And '
            'I’ll do the cooking,’” said Williams. The preconception that most '
            'homeless people are addicts is not true, said Williams: “Sixty '
            'per cent of our chaps are homeless because of relationship '
            'breakdowns.” During the pandemic, Embassy rented properties to '
            'move men from the tour bus into homes, including one who had '
            'spent seven years in shelters waiting for a council house. With '
            'about 13,000 households on the waiting list in Manchester, he '
            'never got to the top as a “single bloke with no criminal record, '
            'no addictions and no real mental health struggles”, said '
            'Williams.\n'
            'Potential residents will be referred by Manchester city council '
            'or local homeless charities and then interviewed by Embassy. “The '
            'interview is really to ascertain whether you’re serious about '
            'change,” said Williams. “Believe it or not, about half the people '
            'we interview say, ‘I don’t want a job, I don’t ever want to work, '
            'I want to live in a council flat. That’s my ambition.’ And we go, '
            '‘That’s great. But we are not that thing.’” Smaller homeless '
            'villages have been built in recent years in Bristol and '
            'Edinburgh, and the Hope Gardens development in Ealing, west '
            'London, has 60 apartments in containers used as emergency '
            'accommodation in 20ft containers for the newly homeless. What '
            'makes Embassy different is the ambition to build a community. '
            'Central to this is a village hall, complete with counselling '
            'room, laundry and communal computers, plus a training kitchen to '
            'help residents learn to cook, said Williams: “That way we can be '
            'a community, we watch England lose at the football, we can '
            'celebrate people’s birthdays, and Christmas dinner – all that '
            'good stuff.”',

{'article': 'Despite quizzical think pieces on the motivations behind the '
            'Great Resignation, anyone who pays rent or a mortgage knows why '
            'this “labor shortage” is under way. After years of inflation and '
            'stagnant wages, the pandemic has revealed the value of labor, the '
            'worthlessness of commutes and office culture, and the importance '
            'of finding personal comfort in times of increasing precarity.\n'
            'In other words, we are living in what labor economist Lawrence '
            'Katz calls “a once-in-a-generation ‘take this job and shove it’ '
            'moment” – which gives workers a once-in-a-generation upper hand. '
            'The potential of this cultural moment is not limited to the 2.9% '
            'of the workforce who have quit their jobs in the past few months. '
            'As CEOs scramble to maintain retention rates, those who have kept '
            'their jobs can express solidarity with resigning workers and '
            'contribute to the cultural shift by slowing the pace of '
            'productivity. What I am proposing is not exactly a “slowdown”, '
            'but a “slow-up”. Traditionally, a slowdown is a strike tactic in '
            'which workers remain on the job but slow productivity with the '
            'aim of negotiating for a particular objective, such as higher '
            'wages. In this sense, a slowdown is a highly localized and '
            'temporary effort. By contrast, a slow-up must be unlocalized and '
            'permanent. It would entail a grassroots redefinition of workplace '
            'expectations – and frankly, it has been a long time coming. In '
            '2020, 80% of US workers reported feeling that they have too many '
            'things to do and not enough time to do them – a phenomenon known '
            'as time poverty. This isn’t just in our heads: a 2014 Gallup poll '
            'revealed that US workers clocked in an average of 47 hours a '
            'week, with more than 18% working over 60 hours a week. It would '
            'be naive to attribute these statistics to the industrious spirit '
            'of the American worker, considering that full-time minimum wage '
            'workers cannot afford an apartment in any state in the US without '
            'taking on another job.\n'
            'It is no surprise that “speed up” and “slow down” evidence a '
            'cultural recognition that a fast pace moves you up the corporate '
            'ladder, while a slower pace leaves you behind. Instead, a slow up '
            '(intentionally rhymes with “glow up”) signals that slowing down '
            'can improve workers’ quality of life. The objective is not to '
            'drive down profits (though that may happen), but to uphold the '
            'ideal that everyone deserves a life of dignity, which includes '
            'rest and distance from work. Undoubtedly, some will say that '
            'calling for a slow-up ignores the lived realities of workers or '
            'the racialized and gendered dynamics of the workplace, where '
            'people of color still have to work twice as hard to be recognized '
            'and women are still expected to do unpaid work. While such '
            'criticism is valuable, it also reaffirms the expectation that '
            'living a worthwhile life or getting a human amount of rest is a '
            'luxury afforded only to the privileged. Moreover, such a critique '
            'intentionally ignores the work of Black activists and artists who '
            'explicitly call for a change in work rhythms. A 2019 art '
            'installation by Navild Acosta and Fannie Sosa, Black Power '
            'Naps/Siestas Negras, responds to the fact that 34% of Hispanics '
            'and 45% of Black US residents get less than seven hours of sleep '
            'a night. Similarly, Tricia Hersey, a performance artist known as '
            'the Nap Bishop, has convincingly argued since 2016 that rest is a '
            'necessary component of reparations. So, while it is true that '
            'groups who bear the brunt of workplace disparities would be '
            'taking the biggest risks in a slow-up, it is also true that we '
            'would have the most to gain. We would be, effectively, stealing '
            'back our lives. Although a slow-up is not a strike tactic, it '
            'does elicit many of the same concerns of a “prisoners’ dilemma” '
            'as workers’ strikes. Because our economic structure puts workers '
            'in continuous competition with each other, a worker who slows the '
            'pace could lose an opportunity, a promotion, or employment '
            'itself. The slow-up requires solidarity, flexibility and '
            'creativity. Depending on the job and the worker, slowing up might '
            'mean responding to emails only three days a week, blocking out '
            'time for yourself before and after draining meetings, taking '
            'unofficial breaks, following work expectations to the letter of a '
            'company’s mission statement, or strategically engaging in '
            'untrackable forms of “time theft”. Attending to a slower pace can '
            'also help us be vigilant against corporate attempts to rebrand '
            'fast-paced exploitation. CEOs are scrambling to create a “new '
            'normal” that mollifies workers’ desire for work-life balance '
            'while keeping existing power structures in play. While more than '
            '70% of CEOs expect that the labor shortage will disrupt their '
            'business in the next 12 months, two of the main solutions they '
            'are implementing across the board – more flexible hours and '
            'increased diversity – fall short of the policy changes workers '
            'need, such as increased holidays and paid time off. It is not '
            'that flexible schedules or emphasis on diversity and inclusion '
            'are bad for workers, but rather that both of these retention '
            'strategies are easily subsumed into the traditional rat race.\n'
            'Studies already show that more flexible hours lead to more work '
            'hours – specifically, 2.5 more hours of work a day. This is not '
            'to say that flexible hours cannot be beneficial, but that workers '
            'should preemptively find ways of slowing up to make the most of '
            'their new work dynamic. Similarly, corporate-driven diversity '
            'efforts very quickly hit the limits of their potential, '
            'particularly given that most begin and end with “we should see '
            'more diversity in our employee base and … our leadership”. In the '
            'spirit of slow-up, we could ask: What would it mean, instead, if '
            'diversity, equity, and inclusion practices were worker-led and '
            'intended to explore labor practices that can grapple with rest as '
            'a necessary part of reparations and closing the sleep gap? What '
            'if inclusion examined the relationships that emerge from labor '
            'organizing? Or if “equity” (defined as fairness and justice in '
            'the way people are treated) responded to the many reports '
            'highlighting that the US remains an outlier in overwork? As with '
            'any labor movement, the Great Resignation is a waiting game. The '
            'longer workers remain between jobs, the more their expenses go up '
            '– an important advantage to employers. Keeping those who quit '
            'their job afloat through mutual aid and pushing for generous paid '
            'time off and parental leave during this crucial time of workplace '
            'redefinition is also in the interest of our collective wellbeing. '
            'Does this seem impossible? The truth is, you don’t have to be '
            'idealistic to participate in the slow-up. You only have to be '
            'imaginative. You only have to think about the meaningful things '
            'that could fill your day and imagine what it would feel like to '
            'work more slowly and feel more rested – and then strategically '
            'act as though that were already possible. In the words of '
            'Courtney Desiree Morris: “What if we attempted to live as free as '
            'the many-gendered daughters that are yet meant to arrive but we '

{'article': 'Chloe had encouraged her husband to accept the new job. “I told '
            'him: ‘Life is too short to be unhappy.’” The effect on him was '
            'transformative – but not in the way she had imagined. “One '
            'minute, he was a family guy, the next, he was always working late '
            'and going in early.” She found out why when she visited him one '
            'day at work. “My heart dropped when I saw them talking to each '
            'other – they had this closeness,” says Chloe, 49. “I realised '
            'then that it was her that had come between us. He went to her '
            'with problems, shared secrets and aspirations – all those things '
            'that we used to do together.” Chloe is confident the relationship '
            'was never physical – but 15 years later it is still enormously '
            'hurtful. At the time, they had been married for 12 years and had '
            'a three-year-old son. “Before, I thought that pain could only '
            'come from a physical betrayal – there wasn’t a rulebook to follow '
            'for this type.” *** An emotional affair is characterised by '
            'nonsexual intimacy with someone other than your partner, in such '
            'a way that violates their trust and expectations. With technology '
            'enabling round-the-clock and covert communication, it has never '
            'been easier to fall into that grey area between “just friends” '
            'and “more than friends” – often with plausible deniability. '
            'According to a 2015 YouGov study of 1,660 British adults, 20% of '
            'people have been unfaithful to their partner. Of those, 15% said '
            'their infidelity had no physical component. When the Guardian ran '
            'a reader callout asking for experiences of emotional affairs, the '
            'responses showed that the fallout of this kind of affair is no '
            'less devastating for the lack of sex. Chloe says she could feel '
            'her husband’s relationship with his colleague “eroding” her own, '
            'but “it was so easy to duck out of discussing it because nothing '
            'had physically happened”. Then she looked at her husband’s phone: '
            '“His messages to her had their own kind of language and intimacy '
            '– I knew then that we wouldn’t work.” Not every relationship '
            'would be threatened by such a bond: only 44% of respondents to '
            'the YouGov survey said they considered a non-physical connection '
            'to be cheating. Some people actively make room for others through '
            'consensual non-monogamy. Albert, a retiree who identifies as '
            'queer, says an “emotional affair” strikes him as a non-sequitur: '
            '“It equates the attachment with something that is duplicitous – '
            'this need not be the case.”\n'
            'Jealousy over friends or colleagues might also denote a '
            'relationship that is controlling or even abusive. But in '
            'instances where those suspicions are well founded, the truth may '
            'emerge only after many painful arguments, denial and even '
            'gaslighting. Confirmation of her ex-partner’s emotional affair '
            'made Anneka, 31, feel strangely relieved: “I felt vindicated that '
            'I had been right. I’d spent a long time questioning whether I was '
            'just being crazy and controlling.” Anneka’s paranoia had been '
            'piqued by her then boyfriend being “glued to his phone”, while '
            'keeping it out of her sight. “I’m pretty confident he wasn’t '
            'cheating on me physically – but, in my mind, emotional cheating '
            'is almost as bad.” What constitutes infidelity is specific to '
            'each relationship, says Sarah Calvert, a sex and relationships '
            'therapist based in London, but secrecy can be proof enough. “That '
            'is one of the factors – telling secrets and deep, intimate '
            'feelings that you wouldn’t want your partner to know you were '
            'sharing. It comes down to that basic question: would you be happy '
            'for your partner to be overhearing these conversations, or to '
            'know how much time you spend thinking about them?” Georgina, 40, '
            'says her three-year emotional affair with a colleague was “as '
            'intense as a physical affair – perhaps more so. We never even '
            'kissed on the mouth. I had never felt closer to anyone.” Dr Gayle '
            'Brewer, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of '
            'Liverpool, says that if our partner is confiding in someone else '
            'instead of us, perhaps with intimate details about our '
            'relationship, “we tend to view that as a betrayal”. Conversely, '
            '“if we feel as if our partner is not listening to us or '
            'supporting us, we’re more likely to engage in emotional '
            'infidelity,” she says (although a strong support network outside '
            'the relationship could mitigate this).\n'
            'The impact is felt more by women, says Brewer, with studies '
            'showing “time and time again” that they are more distressed by an '
            'emotional affair than by a sexual one, while the opposite is true '
            'for men. “Men tend to question their partners: ‘Have you had sex '
            'with that person?’ Women tend to ask: ‘Do you love that person?’ '
            'And the unfaithful partner will deny the aspect that’s more '
            'hurtful.” Daphne, 25, broke up with her boyfriend over his '
            'messages to a former colleague: “They were chatting like '
            'boyfriend and girlfriend. It hurt more than if he had drunkenly '
            'snogged someone on a night out.” When they got back together a '
            'year later, her boyfriend struggled with Daphne’s sexual '
            'encounters during the break. “He didn’t really have the right to '
            'say anything about it,” she says. The common conception is that '
            'an emotional affair is a precursor to a physical one. “A little '
            'bit of chemistry or sexual tension” is typical of emotional '
            'affairs, says Calvert, but their underlying cause – the '
            'behaviours driving the betrayal – may not be obvious. “In my '
            'experience, it comes from deeper issues within the relationship '
            'or the person – unresolved issues from past traumas, for example, '
            'or a need that’s not being met.” Walter, a middle-aged father of '
            'three, paraphrases When Harry Met Sally: “Affairs are a symptom, '
            'not a cause.” His wife’s emotional affair, with a female friend, '
            'had roots in her sexual confusion and childhood abuse, he says. '
            '“I can’t judge her from an intellectual perspective. But I can '
            'say that when your lover gives her heart to someone else, it’s '
            'simply painful.”\n'
            'Other readers linked their (or their partner’s) emotional affair '
            'to a wide range of factors including religious upbringing, '
            'difficulties in conceiving, new parenthood, mental and physical '
            'illness, the death of a parent, professional impostor syndrome, '
            'and the disruption to a social network caused by a change in job '
            'or location. One 29-year-old described feelings of panic at a '
            'looming engagement: “I couldn’t explain why – I had spent the '
            'past six years dreaming of our future. But a birthday message '
            'from an ex-lover popped up in my inbox and the rest unfolded at a '
            'rapid pace.” Much more pronounced than doubts about the '
            'relationship was the toll taken on them by day-to-day '
            'responsibilities, especially after many years of monogamy. “The '
            'emotional high we both got from a feeling of being recognised as '
            'people – not parents, colleagues, spouses, whatever – was '
            'addictive,” says Yvonne, 47, who had an emotional affair with her '
            'colleague. Clara, 24, echoed many respondents in describing a man '
            'she met via an app, with whom she talked nonstop for four months: '
            '“He was everything I wanted my partner to be.” When the third '
            'party is often idealised, it is not a fair comparison, says '
            'Calvert. “It’s like this big fantasy is created – they seem to '
            'understand you, but actually you’re not seeing the whole of them, '
            'because you don’t have a full relationship.” Confronting what is '
            'at the root of your emotional affair could reveal the path out of '
            'it – and strengthen your relationship, she adds. “Just like '
            'physical affairs, emotional affairs give an opportunity to look '
            'at the underlying issues, whether that’s within the individual or '
            'the relationship. It can be a catalyst for quite a seismic change '
            '– but re-establishing trust takes a long time.” Phyllis, 58, and '
            'her husband are opening up their 20-year marriage to polyamory '
            'after admitting to emotional affairs: “I’m not ready to give up '
            'the person I’m having an emotional affair with, but I am willing '
            'to repair what is broken in my marriage,” she says. Caitlin, 37, '
            'says her husband’s emotional entanglement with a colleague has '
            '“been a real kick up the arse for us”. At the time, they had been '
            'working long hours and raising young children, with little joy in '
            'their lives or time for each other. After the affair came out, '
            'they relocated, resolving to make a change. Now their marriage is '
            '“better than ever”, says Caitlin. “We remember we do actually '
            'like and love each other, and we feel good that we’ve gone '
            'through so much together … it just as easily could have been me '
            'who had had an emotional affair; things were that bad. We’re '
            'grateful that it happened now.” Even if a relationship does not '
            'recover, there is more to be gained from confronting the problems '
            'at play, says Calvert. Through therapy, Walter found the '
            'self-esteem he needed to end his marriage after his wife’s '
            'emotional affair. India, 28, says she is much happier after hers '
            'led to a divorce. Likewise, Tanya, 30, says it was a catalyst to '
            'end her 10-year relationship: “I’m thoroughly enjoying the '
            'independence and growth.” As for Chloe, her husband’s emotional '
            'affair led to their divorce. “I slowly rebuilt myself by going to '
            '[the counselling service] Relate to ‘get over it’ – and him.” And '
            'she did, later remarrying and having another child. She says her '
            'husband’s emotional affair was the making of “the more savvy me. '
            'I wouldn’t be who I am today without it.” Some names have been '
            'changed',

{'article': 'Former Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team players fear a proposed '
            'investigation by Major League Soccer into the club’s response to '
            'allegations of sexual misconduct will be a whitewash and fail to '
            'adequately address multiple instances of wrongdoing. The players, '
            'who represented Vancouver Whitecaps in the 2008 and 2011 seasons, '
            'are supported by Canada’s Professional Footballers Association '
            '(PFACan) in a call for key club executives to be fired. It is '
            'understood the players this week will also demand Concacaf '
            'suspends its president, Victor Montagliani, until an independent '
            'investigation is completed into events surrounding Canada '
            'Soccer’s failure to deal with separate allegations against former '
            'Whitecaps coach Bob Birarda in 2008. Birarda was head coach of '
            'Canada’s under-20 women’s national team and the Whitecaps women’s '
            'team while Montagliani was director of national teams. '
            'Montagliani also serves as a Fifa vice-president. At the time, an '
            'internal investigation into Birarda’s behavior resulted in Canada '
            'Soccer and Whitecaps stating the coach had left his roles by '
            '“mutual agreement”, yet he continued to coach girls’ youth '
            'soccer. In 2019, Montagliani told the Guardian he had taken the '
            'allegations against Birarda seriously. “Absolutely the '
            'allegations were treated seriously,” Montagliani said. “The '
            'federation was notified through our general secretariat. Our '
            'staff was dispatched to meet with this ombudsman. There were a '
            'couple of days of discussions and interviews and after that it '
            'was deemed that this coach was no longer with our program. He was '
            'not an employee of the federation. We would just pay him a per '
            'diem as he was coaching. He parted ways with our program and the '
            'Whitecaps followed suit in parting ways with him as well. I never '
            'saw the report but the information that was given to the board '
            '[was sufficient].” Birarda was arrested in December 2020 and '
            'faces six counts of sexual exploitation, two counts of sexual '
            'assault and one count of child luring, involving allegations '
            'spanning 20 years from 1988 to 2008. He is out on bail and has '
            'yet to enter a plea.\n'
            '“I welcome the interest of Major League Soccer in these issues '
            'but we don’t need MLS to be in charge of this investigation,” '
            'said Malloree Enoch. In a Guardian investigation published last '
            'week, Enoch alleged her former coach Hubert Busby Jr attempted to '
            'pressure her for sex during a recruitment process spanning 2010 '
            'and 2011. Busby denies the allegations. After the Guardian '
            'reported the allegations last week, MLS said it intended to '
            'launch an investigation. “MLS will only look after its own '
            'interests,” Enoch said. “We need to see a thorough '
            'investigation.” The former Whitecaps players are expected to '
            'release a statement in the next 48 hours supported by PFACan that '
            'will include a demand that any Whitecaps or Canada Soccer '
            'executive involved in the departures of Birarda and Busby, but '
            'who chose to misrepresent the reasons behind their exits, be '
            'fired. “These executives have lost their ability to continue in a '
            'leadership position,” Paul Champ, legal counsel to PFACan, told '
            'the Guardian. The players will also call for Concacaf and Fifa to '
            'suspend Montagliani from his roles until an independent '
            'investigation into the 2008 events is completed. That issue '
            'centers on Birarda being allowed to coach in the local community '
            'after allegations of sexual misconduct were known by Canada '
            'Soccer. “We are happy we can carry this burden for the players,” '
            'Champ said of the union’s support. “There is already some '
            'reflection going on at Canada Soccer and we would like to '
            'continue to push them to consider these issues. All of these '
            'issues are connected and we need to know what the governing '
            'bodies are doing about it.” The Whitecaps organization has been '
            'in crisis since the Guardian last week revealed the allegations '
            'by Enoch. Chief executive officer Axel Schuster called Enoch on '
            'Friday night to apologize for the club’s failure to act at the '
            'time of the alleged incidents. After local journalists camped '
            'outside the club’s headquarters on Friday hoping to speak with '
            'officials about the allegations, Schuster released a statement '
            'claiming unnamed executives had been placed on leave. Still, the '
            'club has yet to respond to questions from the Guardian sent to '
            'chief operating officer Rachel Lewis on 19 October. Lewis, along '
            'with current management executives Dan Lenarduzzi, Greg Anderson, '
            'and Bob Lenarduzzi are longtime executives at the club and were '
            'aware of the allegations against Birarda and Busby at the time '
            'they were made. Dan Lenarduzzi, a Whitecaps club vice-president, '
            'emailed members of the women’s team in 2011 after Busby’s '
            'departure from the club instructing them to not comment publicly '
            'on his exit. The club did not mention the allegations when Busby '
            'left the Whitecaps, instead saying it was in “the club’s best '
            'interest to make a change in coaching staff for our women’s team '
            'program”. Busby told the Guardian that allegations of misconduct '
            'were never discussed when his contract was being negotiated at '
            'the end of the 2011 season. Busby, the head coach of the Jamaica '
            'women’s national team, is scheduled to meet with the Jamaican '
            'Football Federation on Tuesday to discuss the allegations around '
            'his time with the Whitecaps. Issues with how Whitecaps executives '
            'have dealt with abuse claims have not been limited to the women’s '
            'teams. In 2017, the mother of a Vancouver Whitecaps male youth '
            'team player who was allegedly sexually assaulted by his teammates '
            'claimed the club discouraged the boy and his family from '
            'immediately reporting the incident to police. The mother of the '
            'player – a minor at the time of the incident – told local media '
            'the MLS club provided her with two options to address the issue: '
            'hire either a private investigator or a moonlighting police '
            'officer who had previously provided the club with matchday '
            'security to look into the allegations. “Our gut instinct was that '
            'they were trying to downplay it and protect themselves,” she said '
            'at the time. “We felt that they wanted to deal with it internally '
            'and not let it get out.” The assault involved the player being '
            'pinned to the ground inside the team’s training-ground locker '
            'room before what was described as “a graphic sex assault”. “These '
            'were his teammates,” the player’s mother said. “It’s mind-blowing '
            'to think that this even happened.” Police eventually charged two '
            'players with sexual assault after the mother called the police. '
            'It is unclear whether the Whitecaps reported the incident to the '
            'police. “The safety and wellbeing of our players is our top '
            'priority and we have been cooperating fully with the [police] '
            'investigation,” the Whitecaps said at the time. Major League '
            'Soccer did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this '
            'story.',

            'other Black farmers, ranchers and gardeners across the country '
            'through social media, the Stewarts hope to build a ranch that '
            'inspires their children and other new generations of Black '
            'farmers to return to the south-west.\n'
            'In 1920, Black farmers made up 14% of the industry, but after '
            'thousands lost their land due to discriminatory lending practices '
            'at the US Department of Agriculture, less than 2% remained. In '
            'order to connect with other Black farmers, the Stewarts joined a '
            'Facebook group where they met Texans who taught them about '
            'hydroponics and a South African farmer whose work on regenerative '
            'agriculture is inspiring their goals for the ranch. At home in '
            'Arizona, they also connected with Drinking Gourd Farms, a network '
            'of Black gardeners and homesteaders in Phoenix, who are helping '
            'the Stewarts mulch their farm’s soil. As the Stewarts prepare '
            'their ranch they’re hoping to create a world where their children '
            'don’t think twice about being part of a Black-led agricultural '
            'revolution. When James and Rachael first bought their land '
            'outside of Douglas, they were motivated by the inequities they '
            'had seen come to light during the early months of the Covid-19 '
            'pandemic. Tyson Foods had just shut down several of its '
            'meatpacking plants and published a full-page New York Times ad '
            'warning that “the food supply chain is breaking”. That same week, '
            'the USDA reported that beef production was down 25% and grocery '
            'stores started rationing the amount of meat each customer could '
            'purchase. That’s when James and Rachael realized the perils of a '
            'factory farming system, where the fate of one company could harm '
            'their ability to feed their four children. They wondered if '
            'they’d have more control if they owned their own livestock – and '
            'if the food supply chain overall might be more sustainable if '
            'there were many local farms, meatpackers and processors, as '
            'opposed to just a few. Although those questions have continued to '
            'motivate them, James and Rachael say it’s their children – who go '
            'by their nicknames J5, Nay, Zey and JG – that are the real '
            'driving force behind their work.\n'
            '“We live in a very white state,” said Rachael, and many people '
            '“don’t realize the societal impact of [Black] kids not seeing '
            'positive role models who look like them”. Arizona’s population is '
            'only about 5% Black, and nearly 83% white. When the Stewarts '
            'discovered that they’d be nearly the only Black ranchers in '
            'Arizona, they decided they wanted to fill that gap for their '
            'kids. “Sometimes you need to actually see something before it can '
            'become tangible,” said Rachael. “You need to see a Black farmer '
            'before you realize you could be a Black farmer.” James and '
            'Rachael see their work as parents not just as role models, but '
            'also as the creators of new systems that they can pass down to '
            'their children. “We want to create a situation where our kids '
            'have an option, and they have a trade,” so that if they “don’t '
            'want to take on the debt” of college “that doesn’t hinder them '
            'from being successful”, says James. Although he and his wife both '
            'have college degrees, they’d like their children to have choices '
            'so they don’t “have to go $80,000 into debt to get a $35,000 '
            'job”. We’re trying to “create an alternative system for minority '
            'and socially disadvantaged ranchers”, says Rachael, so that we '
            'can hand over a business to our children “that is always going to '
            'be needed”. Part of that work has involved creating alternative '
            'networks with other Black ranchers, farmers, gardeners and '
            'entrepreneurs. The Stewarts realize they have a long way to go to '
            'make their ranch financially viable for the long term. Although '
            'they were able to purchase their initial animals and supplies '
            'with the support of a Go Fund Me account, they are now Beta '
            'testing approaches to sales, meeting with meat processors, and '
            'also applying for grants, including ones from the USDA.\n'
            'One of those first collaborations was with the Drinking Gourd '
            'Farms community in Phoenix, which is primarily led by Black '
            'Muslim refugee women. During the early months of the pandemic, '
            'Drinking Gourd Farms also began to re-evaluate the sustainability '
            'of the food supply chain. To make sure Black families had access '
            'to healthy food while that system was in turmoil, they '
            'distributed food boxes to 4,600 families across the state. When a '
            'few of Drinking Gourd Farms’ members heard about the Stewarts’ '
            'plans, they drove down to visit the family in Douglas. That’s how '
            'James and Rachael met their ranch manager, Grand Rahba. Rahba had '
            'spent most of the past decade working at independent farms and '
            'gardens across the country, learning sustainable techniques such '
            'as composting and permaculture, before landing at Drinking Gourd '
            'Farms. On those farms, Rahba says he learned the techniques to '
            '“set up an ecosystem that will sustain itself” and the '
            '“importance of having access to stuff, being able to grow your '
            'own food, raise animals, have space”. When he met the Stewarts, '
            'he was immediately drawn to their mission and bought his own five '
            'acres of land adjacent to theirs. For Rahba, Southwest Black '
            'Ranchers was an opportunity to prioritize alternatives to '
            'capitalism, that would allow him, the Stewarts and other Black '
            'farmers to reconnect with the land and their livestock, while '
            'reimagining their relationship to work and rest. A history of '
            'pioneering Black cowboys It’s late morning on the Stewart’s ranch '
            'and Romeo, their sole male alpaca, has gotten loose. He’s '
            'supposed to be in his pen while the females graze, but he’s wily '
            'and desperate to mate, so instead he’s chasing Soleil – who seems '
            'decidedly uninterested in his affections. The pair are not two '
            'feet away from crashing into their pen’s fencing when 12-year-old '
            'J5 lassos Romeo in one fell swoop – accomplishing a skill he and '
            'his siblings have been practicing for months. Zey, Nay and JG '
            'cheer for their brother as he shepherds Romeo into his stall, and '
            'then each takes their own turn trying to lasso the alpaca under '
            'J5’s now expert guidance. What none of them realize in the moment '
            'is that J5 has mastered a skill that Black ranchers invented and '
            'perfected generations before him.\n'
            '“It was enslaved cowboys of African descent in Mexico who '
            'invented this new technique of capturing cattle” with a lasso, '
            'says Andrew Sluyter, professor at Louisiana State University and '
            'author of Black Ranching Frontiers: African Cattle Herders of the '
            'Atlantic World, 1500–1900. “The previous way of capturing cattle '
            'was simply to ride behind them with a lance that had a sharp '
            'blade on the end of it” and cut the tendons in the cow’s rear '
            'legs. But then, in the 17th century, there was “a change in the '
            'laws that makes it illegal in New Spain and what’s now Mexico for '
            'cowboys who are slaves … to own one of those lances with that '
            'halfmoon-shaped blade on the end of it because there were more '
            'and more slave rebellions.” That’s when enslaved cowboys '
            'developed the idea of lassoing cattle. “There was this imperative '
            'for Black cowboys to advance some kind of alternative means to '
            'capture cattle that didn’t involve a weapon,” said Sluyter, who '
            'cites an engraving from 1643 of Black cowboys demonstrating the '
            'technique by using a long pole to drop a lasso over a cow. “By '
            'the 1700s it had been perfected so they no longer needed that '
            'pole.”\n'
            'Although lassos and cowboy hats are typically associated with '
            'white cowboys in the American west, Sluyter says it shouldn’t '
            'come as a surprise that many early ranching techniques were '
            'developed by people of African descent. “If you look at the world '
            'in 1492 when Columbus lands in the Caribbean, the largest single '
            'area of open range cattle ranching was the Sahel” in Africa, he '
            'says. “That’s where cattle and humans evolved together over '
            'millions of years” and “that’s where the expertise was.” The word '
            '“cowboy” itself originated during slavery when ranchers called '
            'Black cow hands by the pejorative “cow boy”. During '
            'reconstruction, many formerly enslaved men took jobs as ranch '
            'hands and by the late 1800s, historians estimated that one in '
            'four cowboys working on the frontier were Black. One of those men '
            'was Nat Love, who earned the nickname “Deadwood Dick” in a roping '
            'competition in 1876. Another was Bass Reeves, the first Black '
            'deputy US marshal west of the Mississippi River – and allegedly '
            'the inspiration for the Lone Ranger.\n'
            'Today, the legacy of Black cowboys is continued by groups such as '
            'the Louisiana Trail Riders and the Compton Cowboys. For more than '
            'a decade, the Arizona Black Rodeo Association has held a rodeo in '
            'Phoenix each year. And Black cowboy Lu Vason has, since 1984, '
            'hosted the traveling Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, named after '
            'the Black cowboy who invented rodeo steer wrestling (or '
            'bulldogging). But to this day, few Black cowboys or ranchers '
            'actually own their own land or livestock. Finding a home on the '
            'land If you ask James and Rachael for their address, they’ll send '
            'you GPS coordinates instead. Although their ranch isn’t far '
            'outside of Douglas, their neighbors are few and far between – '
            'depending on the route you take, you might see the “No '
            'Trespassing” signs along a neighbor’s fence, but then again you '
            'might only spot the distant mountains and mesquite trees. Despite '
            'the many neighboring farms, the Stewarts are actually located in '
            'a food desert: the only grocery store for miles north of the '
            'border is a WalMart. “There’s a fear of being out on the land, '
            'and being rural, and being the only minority there. It’s a valid '
            'fear,” said Rachael. Moving out of the city, she and James say, '
            'has been precarious. “If you’re coming out here with money '
            'obviously everything’s different, but if you’re not coming out '
            'here with money then there’s a lot of change you’ve got to get '
            'ready to deal with. It’s not the easiest experience in the '
            'world,” says James. But if you do come out on the land, “you’re '
            'getting a lot more freedom”.\n'
            'Since moving, James and Rachael have helped three other Black '
            'families buy land on their same street. They’re still wary of '
            'harassment, but they’ve started building their own networks – '
            'largely made up of people they’ve met on social media, like a '
            'South African farmer whose work on regenerative agriculture is '
            'inspiring their goals for the ranch and Black ranchers in Texas '
            'who have taught them about hydroponics. Black farmers “are '
            'already doing these things independently because they’ve been '
            'forced to”, says Rachael. For generations, official structures, '
            'such as the USDA, did not support Black farmers equally, so those '
            'farmers created their own systems. But the result, Rachael says, '
            'is that those independent networks exist now for ranchers who '
            'hope to challenge the factory farming system. The Stewarts have '
            'built almost everything on their ranch from scratch. They’ve '
            'traded their labor for supplies, built pens out of pallets and '
            'wire fencing, and even adopted rehomed animals to grow their '
            'flock. “We’ve never bought anything new. Everything we’ve ever '
            'had was used,” says Rachael. That reality can be difficult, she '
            'says, “sometimes you get to this point where you think you don’t '
            'deserve anything”, it’s a mindset that “minorities just always '
            'get the leftovers”. But despite – or rather because of – that, '
            'Rachael says, she and James “are trying to create a blueprint for '
            'people to follow”. Including their kids. “Whatever we learn, we '
            'want to be able to pass on.”',

{'article': 'For the Indigenous Maya Ch’orti’ people of La Unión in eastern '
            'Guatemala, the daily struggle for water involves catching every '
            'drop of rain that drips from sloping metal roofs and walking long '
            'distances to fill plastic containers from overused streams. In '
            'this parched region, communities rely on rainfall to feed their '
            'families, and in 2019 worked together to build water reservoirs '
            'high in the mountains in order to better cope with increasingly '
            'frequent droughts and unpredictable rains which caused their '
            'maize and bean crops to fail. But the following year brought the '
            'opposite problem. After years without enough rain, two powerful '
            'hurricanes, Eta and Iota, struck within a fortnight of each '
            'other, causing flash floods and landslides that left dozens of '
            'people trapped in partially collapsed houses. “We always worried '
            'about not enough water, and then this abundance came. What a '
            'disaster,” said Yesenia Martínez, the village mayor. It was '
            'around 9pm on a November evening when the concrete walls in '
            'Martinez’s own home started to collapse. It was pitch black. '
            'Children screamed as cracks opened in the floor and rain poured '
            'infrom all sides. “We tried to fill the cracks with stones and '
            'plastic sheets, but the earth just gave way. We didn’t lose any '
            'lives, thank god – but we lost everything else,” said Martinez, '
            '38, wiping away tears. It took almost a week for neighbours to '
            'rescue Martinez and her family using ropes, sticks and planks of '
            'wood to cross the flooded river. The season’s bean crops were '
            'ruined, the soil too sodden for replanting. No government help '
            'ever arrived.\n'
            'Almost a year later, Martinez and some of her extended family are '
            'living in temporary rickety houses built from corrugated metal '
            'sheets and wood, far from the river. But there isn’t room for '
            'everyone, and so her four youngest siblings are back living in '
            'the derelict house. “I cried when I came back here. The house '
            'could crumble at any moment or a rock could fall on us while '
            'we’re asleep. Of course we want to leave, but we’re poor and '
            'don’t have anywhere else to go,” said Mirna Martínez, 19. '
            'Barefoot children, skinny dogs and noisy chickens mill about the '
            'partially collapsed structure, which is held together by wooden '
            'beams and crumbling concrete blocks. Two days before the '
            'Guardian’s visit, a landslide had gobbled up another chunk of the '
            'neighbor’s coffee crops just 50 meters or so away. It wasn’t even '
            'raining when the ground gave way. *** Guatemala is one of five '
            'Latin American nations – along with Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia '
            'and Haiti – identified among the 11 countries most at risk from '
            'climate chaos due to a combination of geography and poor '
            'governance, in a recent US government report on climate and '
            'global insecurity. Eta and Iota marked the first time two major '
            'Atlantic hurricanes had been recorded in November, and came after '
            'six years of drought in Central America’s dry corridor, an '
            'impoverished region that is highly vulnerable to catastrophic '
            'extreme weather events such as storms, torrential rain, droughts '
            'and heatwaves – all of which are getting longer and more intense '
            'due to global heating. Guatemala has contributed very little to '
            'greenhouse gas emissions but its people are suffering acutely '
            'from their impact. Acute malnutrition in children under five has '
            'more than doubled since 2019 due to the hurricane related crop '
            'losses, volatile commodity prices and the pandemic. Many '
            'campesinos were unable to reach coffee plantations, where they '
            'can earn $5 to $7 a day, because damaged roads and bridges were '
            'left unrepaired for months.\n'
            'Figures show that the largest increase in acute malnutrition '
            'cases and child deaths occurred in the regions hardest hit by '
            'floods and landslides caused by Eta and Iota. As women cut back '
            'on food to provide more for their children, the rate of low '
            'birthweight babies also skyrocketed. With few personal resources, '
            'little or no government assistance and NGOs struggling to cope '
            'with the unprecedented rise in food insecurity across Latin '
            'America, many Guatemalans have left in search of work and safety. '
            'Martínez’s sons, Brian, 21 and Esban, 18, borrowed thousands of '
            'dollars to pay coyotes or guides to travel overland to the US. '
            'They were repeatedly detained by Mexican immigration officials, '
            'but eventually made it to Florida where they work in '
            'construction, and have started sending some money home every '
            'month.\n'
            '“My sons had to go because we were left with nothing, so many '
            'young people have gone. There’s no work here, especially if '
            'you’re Indigenous,” said Martinez. One of her sisters also '
            'migrated, with her six-year-old daughter. Almost 300,000 '
            'Guatemalans have been detained at the US southern border since '
            'Eta and Iota struck. It’s unclear how many succeeded in entering '
            'the country, but 2021 is on track to break the remittance record, '
            'with more than $11bn sent home by Guatemalans in the first nine '
            'months of the year. “It’s evident from the numbers at the US '
            'border and remittances that the climate crisis and Covid economic '
            'downturn has led to a rise in migration as people try to get away '
            'from hunger – you can’t deny this. It’s already happening and the '
            'projections are not positive,” said Ricardo Rapallo, the '
            'Guatemala representative for the UN Food and Agricultural '
            'Organization (FAO). At the UN climate talks in Glasgow this week, '
            'world leaders will hammer out what help and how much richer '
            'countries – those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions – '
            'should contribute to cover the costs of climate impacts in lower- '
            'income countries. But the lack of scientific data on climate '
            'migration is hurting vulnerable countries like Guatemala, said '
            'Edwin Castellanos, member of the IPCC’s scientific group on '
            'vulnerability and adaptation and dean of the research institute '
            'at Guatemala’s Universidad del Valle. “The future is going to '
            'continue like this – very dry periods followed by very wet '

            'Next year’s IPCC report on vulnerability and adaptation, which '
            'Castellanos helped write, will conclude that there is “low '

            'due to the dearth of scientific research. “We know from '
            'journalistic reporting that climate change is causing migration, '
            'but we lack the hard data because we can’t get the funds to get '

            'Maya Ch’orti’ territory extends south from La Unión in Zacapa to '

            'through the maize harvest in front of the single-room adobe house '
            'where he sleeps with his wife and six children. In 2019, the '
            'family was already struggling when the Guardian visited after '
            'consecutive years of drought had left them without enough food. '
            'So far this year, they’ve had enough maize for Gutiérrez and the '
            'children to eat three tortillas three times a day – but not his '
            'wife, Miriam Ávalos, 25, who has two for each meal. She’s skinny, '
            'tired and breastfeeding four-month-old David, but must fetch '
            'water from the stream every other day when the communal tap runs '
            'dry. The three oldest children, aged 11 to 6, are chronically '
            'malnourished, and have barely grown since 2019. The two youngest '
            'girls, aged 3 and 4, are acutely malnourished after repeated '
            'bouts of diarrhea; their hair is falling out in small clumps. '
            'Guatemala has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world '
            'with almost half of all children suffering chronic '
            'malnourishment, but rates are significantly higher among the '

            'you visited us before, the earth is so dry nothing grows,” said '
            'Ávalos. Two years ago, Gutierrez was desperately trying to '
            'mortgage the family’s small plot of land to pay a coyote. He’s '

{'article': 'On a night when an expected challenge by the main opposition '
            'party quickly fizzled out, candidates from a tiny local party '
            'seized one seat after another in Japan’s general election, '
            'turning an economically vital region into a citadel of rightwing '
            'populism. Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Innovation party) almost '
            'quadrupled its seats from 11 to 41 on Sunday to become the third '
            'largest party in the lower house of Japan’s parliament, after '
            'winning almost every seat in the western prefecture of Osaka. '
            'While the biggest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic '
            'party of Japan, and its allies were counting their losses, Ishin '
            'was becoming the most intriguing backstory in an otherwise '
            'lacklustre election. By the early hours of Monday, the ruling '
            'Liberal Democratic party (LDP), despite winning the national '
            'vote, had been summarily dismissed from Osaka by the upstarts '
            'from Ishin. Liberals and leftwingers will shudder at Ishin’s '
            'rise. But the party succeeded where their candidates had failed, '
            'exploiting disillusionment with the LDP and its junior coalition '
            'partner, Komeito, and hoovering up votes from people who could '
            'not bring themselves to vote for a five-party opposition bloc '
            'that included the socialist and communist parties. “Nippon Ishin '
            'gathered votes from conservative voters who are frustrated with '
            'the LDP-Komeito government,” the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said '
            'on Monday. A new governing coalition in which Ishin replaces '
            'Komeito as the LDP’s official parliamentary ally is unlikely, '
            'however. While Ishin shares the LDP’s enthusiasm for higher '
            'defence spending and a tougher line on China and North Korea, its '
            'opposition to income redistribution would be anathema to the '
            'prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who campaigned on promises of '
            'closing Japan’s wealth gap. Ishin’s emergence as a force in '
            'national elections could be an uncomfortable reminder to Kishida '
            'that his party is no longer the natural home of conservative '
            'voters. Yoichiro Sato, a professor of international relations at '
            'Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, said Ishin was “really '
            'sweeping the Osaka region. They’ve emerged as an important '
            'conservative bloc,” adding that its MPs would oppose Kishida’s '
            '“new capitalism” mission to boost incomes. Yu Uchiyama, a '
            'politics professor at Tokyo University, did not rule out a '
            'political marriage of convenience between the ruling party and '
            'Ishin MPs who support changes to Japan’s “pacifist” constitution '
            '– an ideological obsession of Kishida’s mentor, the former prime '
            'minister Shinzo Abe. “There is a lot of interest, especially in '
            'Asia, over whether Japan will try to revise its constitution, but '
            'by the look of it that won’t be possible with the (existing) '
            'ruling coalition,” Uchiyama said. “But the Japan Innovation party '
            'looks like it has captured a lot of seats, so we may be seeing '
            'some sort of constitution-related coalition, even if the '
            'possibility of constitutional revision remains low.” Formed in '
            '2015 by Toru Hashimoto, the controversial former mayor of Osaka, '
            'Ishin benefited from the popularity of its acting leader, '
            'Hirofumi Yoshimura, who also serves as Osaka governor. “The thing '
            'I’m most surprised by is how well Ishin has done,” said Kenneth '
            'McElwain, a political science professor at Tokyo University. '
            '“Yoshimura developed a major national profile, which I think has '
            'also served as a tailwind for the party overall.” Despite '
            'triggering panic-buying of iodine gargle solution last year after '
            'wrongly claiming it was effective against coronavirus, the '
            '44-year-old Yoshimura – whom one party colleague described as a '
            '“pop idol” – won praise for his leadership and communication '
            'skills during the height of the pandemic. Yoshimura, who has 1.1 '
            'million followers on Twitter – more than the Tokyo governor, '

{'article': 'The husband of a Victorian MP was paid taxpayer funded salaries '
            'by three other MPs to do factional work, according to evidence '
            'given to the state’s anti-corruption commission. The Independent '
            'Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) resumed public '
            'hearings on Monday as part of its investigation into the alleged '
            'misuse of public funds for factional activity, including branch '
            'stacking, within the Labor party. Branch stacking is not illegal '
            'but it is a breach of party rules.\n'
            'Chris Carr SC, counsel assisting the commission, told the hearing '
            'MP Kaushaliya Vaghela agreed in an interview with investigators '
            'that her husband, Dinesh Chauhan, had “predominantly” done '
            'factional work when employed in taxpayer-funded electorate '
            'officer roles. Chauhan worked in the offices of Marlene Kairouz, '
            'Robin Scott and Adem Somyurek. All three were implicated in '
            'widespread branch stacking last year, with Kairouz and Scott '
            'standing down as ministers, and Somyurek dumped from the ministry '
            'and resigning from the party. The trio have denied branch '
            'stacking. Vaghela, an upper house MP for western metropolitan '
            'region, said she believed her husband was rotated by Somyurek '
            'from his office through the offices of Scott and Kairouz as a '
            'reward for his ability to recruit members of the Indian '
            'community. A transcript of part of Vaghela’s Ibac interview was '
            'tendered as evidence to the commission on Monday. “Your husband '
            'also, as we’ve already canvassed, has been quite active in the '
            'community, quite an active recruiter ... do you think that was '
            'the predominant activity he was engaged in during these times?” '
            'an investigator asked Vaghela. “Yes,” Vaghela replied. Sign up to '
            'receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia '
            'every morning\n'
            'She also agreed with the suggestion that Somyurek, Scott and '
            'Kairouz shared full-time staffer roles between their offices for '
            'their own factional purposes, including to “ensure that people '
            'who are good recruiters could be kept in the fold”. Vaghela was '
            'told during the same interview that records of her husband’s work '
            'activity during 2020 showed he had sent one email using the '
            'address, which she agreed was “highly suggestive” he was mostly '
            'doing factional work. Last month, federal Labor MP Anthony Byrne '
            'told the commission that Vaghela, the first Indian-born MP '
            'elected to Victorian parliament, was given her spot by Somyurek '
            'in exchange for a large number of Indian members recruited by '
            'Aloke and Manoj Kumar joining Somyurek’s moderate faction. It was '
            'not suggested Vaghela was aware of the scheme.\n'
            'Vaghela’s evidence came to light during Carr’s questioning of '
            'Christine Kelly, an electorate officer who has worked for Kairouz '
            'since she was elected in 2008. Carr said Ibac had uncovered '
            'evidence of forged documents being produced from the electorate '
            'office giving permission for Kelly to pick up ballot papers from '
            'ALP headquarters on behalf of members. But Kelly said she had no '
            'knowledge of the letters, and could not recall any specific '
            'occasion when she collected ballot papers on behalf of members. '
            'Kelly denied ever doing factional work for Kairouz, and said she '
            'was aware electorate officers were not supposed to do such work '
            'on their taxpayer-funded wages. She also disputed that Chauhan '
            'was involved in factional work and said he would always be '
            'working on official business while she was there.\n'
            'She mostly dealt with constituents, she said, even though Carr '
            'showed her phone records for 2019 that showed for six months, the '
            'office averaged less than one incoming call per day. Constituents '
            'emailed and stopped into the office, Kelly said, but she said '
            'that while the former electorate office at Mill Park was in a '
            'busy shopping centre, the current Caroline Springs office rarely '
            'had visitors. Carr asked Kelly why she had attended a Derrimut '
            'branch meeting in 2019 that had to be cancelled after 70-80 '
            'members showed up unannounced and were “hostile”. Kelly, along '
            'with three other staff employed by Kairouz in her ministerial or '
            'electorate office, had attended, and Carr asked if it was an '
            'attempt to take over the branch. Kelly denied this, and a '
            'suggestion she had been one of the “leaders” who was responsible '
            'for directing the crowd to sign an attendance book. She said '
            'Kairouz had simply asked her to attend the meeting to give an '
            'update on local issues such as “a new footpath … or roundabout '
            'being put in”. Kelly also denied seeing Kairouz in the carpark '
            'outside the meeting. The hearings continue on Wednesday, when '
            'Kirsten Psaila, who has also worked for Kairouz in her electorate '
            'office since 2008, will give evidence. Carr started the hearing '
            'on Monday by revealing that lawyers for the commission had asked '
            'the ALP Victorian branch to provide further information as part '
            'of its investigation. But the branch had so far declined to do '
            'so, Carr said, meaning the commission may have to compel them to '
            'comply.',

{'article': 'A train driver suffered “life-changing” injuries and 13 '
            'passengers, including a child, needed hospital treatment after '
            'two trains collided as they entered a tunnel in Salisbury. '
            'British Transport Police (BTP) said on Monday that they could not '
            'rule out foul play but officers do not believe one of the trains '
            'was derailed as it hit an object on the line, as had originally '
            'been thought. It is understood that police and the rail '
            'investigation branch are focusing on issues including the '
            'signalling and points, human error and weather conditions at the '
            'time. Speaking outside Salisbury railway station, Supt Lisa '
            'Garrett, of BTP, said the crash happened at about 6.45pm on '
            'Sunday when the Great Western Railway (GWR) service from '
            'Southampton to Cardiff collided with a South Western Railway '
            'train from London Waterloo to Honiton in Devon as both entered '
            'the Fisherton tunnel, close to the city centre.\n'
            'Garrett said: “Both trains were travelling in the same direction '
            'and one train struck the other, causing it to derail while in the '
            'tunnel. The front few carriages remained upright while the back '
            'tipped on their side.” There were a total of 92 passengers on '
            'both trains. About 30 people attended a casualty centre set up in '
            'a nearby church. Most were “walking wounded” but 13 passengers '
            'were taken to Salisbury district hospital by ambulance, where '
            'they received treatment for minor injuries. One remained in '
            'hospital in Salisbury on Monday afternoon. Garrett added: “The '
            'driver of the train was more seriously injured and his injuries '
            'are believed to be life-changing. He remains in hospital in a '
            'stable condition and his family have been informed.” The driver, '
            'who was at the controls of the South Western train, had to be cut '
            'from the cab and is believed to be in hospital in Southampton. '
            'Garrett said a senior detective had been appointed to find out '
            'how the trains came together in the tunnel. BTP said it was '
            'working with the rail investigation branch and the office of rail '
            'and road. She said: “We are keeping an open mind but there has '
            'been nothing to suggest the train stuck an object or there was '
            'any significant delay between the trains colliding and one '
            'derailing.” Garrett said there was no evidence the driver of the '
            'train that had been hit had activated his GPRS button, which '
            'warns signallers and other drivers of an emergency. Asked if they '
            'had ruled out that anything criminal was involved, she said: “We '
            'haven’t ruled out foul play; until the investigation has '
            'concluded, we cannot confirm why this has happened.” Passengers '
            'told of their horror at the crash. Alan Crocker, a former Royal '
            'Navy sailor, who was travelling home to Exmouth, Devon, with his '
            'wife, Wendy, said they were travelling at about 20mph when the '
            'collision happened. He said: “The impact was quite weird. There '
            'was a jolt and a juddering which I imagine was the train leaving '
            'the rails. There was a fireball and a little bit of smoke coming '
            'through the train. “There was a smell of diesel; that was a real '
            'concern. That was my initial concern: was there a fire and was '
            'there going to be smoke? Our carriage had gone off at a 35-degree '
            'tilt.” Dimitri Popa, 17, was in the first carriage of the London '
            'Waterloo train. “It all happened very fast. There was a big '
            'crash, then I saw flames,” he said. “We didn’t know where we were '
            'or anything, we were very shocked.” Morgan Harris, 20, who was '
            'travelling on the same train, was thrown from his seat. “It was '
            'all going along normally then all of a sudden there was a massive '
            'bang and all of the lights went out,” he said. “There [were] '
            'sparks and flames. Our train was on its side. I was thrown out of '
            'my seat and I banged around the table.” Asked about railway '
            'safety, a spokesperson for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, '
            'said: “It’s obviously a top priority for this government, which '
            'is why we’ve allocated £40bn-worth of spending to ensure that the '
            'railways continue to be one of the safest in the world.”',

            'Karen Joy Fowler recently and, having mentioned Garner in my '
            'talk, was surprised that neither of them had read – or even heard '
            'of – him. They asked me where to begin and I suggested the '
            'wonderful, time-collapsing Red Shift, largely because I feel like '
            'it contains the best of each of Garner’s worlds: the magic of his '
            'children’s fiction and the emotional and philosophical complexity '
            'of his adult work.\n'
            'Garner’s latest novel, Treacle Walker, also belongs in this '
            'hybrid space. It, too, is concerned with time. Indeed, it seems '
            'as though the subject of time is the theme that underpins much of '
            'his later work – how we experience it, how we might refigure or '
            'alter our relation to it. “Time is ignorance,” reads the book’s '
            'epigraph, from Carlo Rovelli, and the novel is essentially a '
            'response to this idea, seeking to ask how we would experience the '
            'world if we were able to step out of the straitjacket of time. '
            'Garner lives in a medieval medicine house on a site that has been '
            'inhabited for 10,000 years and is a stone’s throw from the '
            'Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire. It should perhaps not '
            'surprise us that, again, he takes time as his subject. Joe, our '
            'hero, is a child living a strange and circumscribed existence. He '
            'has been poorly, he says, and wears a patch to correct a lazy '
            'eye. His parents are not in evidence, and he measures out the '
            'days by watching the passing of Noony, the train, through the '
            'valley below. One day a rag-and-bone man appears, named Treacle '
            'Walker, and offers Joe a cup and a stone in exchange for an old '
            'pair of pyjamas and a lamb’s shoulder bone. The cup has Joe’s '
            'name written upon it, the stone is inscribed with the picture of '
            'a horse. This is classic Garner territory: obscure but resonant '
            'objects, a present that feels wedded to a mythical past, a '
            'questioning child seeking to unravel the mysteries of an '
            'off-kilter world, a landscape freighted with meaning. Joe wanders '
            'out into the marshy wood behind his house where he meets Thin '
            'Amren, a naked man with copper-brown skin and a hood made of '
            'leather. This bog-man informs Joe that his lazy eye is the result '
            'of “the glamourie” – a gift that enables him to see time '
            'collapsed, to perceive the eternal in the now. Joe’s adventures '
            'see him drawn into the mirror-world of a comic book, fighting '
            'alongside “Kit the Ancient Brit” against “Whizzy Wizard and the '
            'Brit Bashers”. He’s aided in these battles by the visits of the '
            'genial Treacle Walker, with his “green violet” eyes and face at '
            'once old and young, like “them knacky postcards that change when '
            'you look”. The riotous energy of seemingly throwaway comics is '
            'shown to be in communion with the power of myth and both express '
            'truths found in the most cutting-edge science. This is a book '
            'about quantum physics as well as ancient lore. Garner has always '
            'suggested that there is essentially just one story, and this '
            'novel, published in his 87th year, contains all the exuberance '
            'and eccentricity, all the deep thought and resounding mythology '
            'of his best work. At the end of his life, Philip Roth wrote the '
            'extraordinary Nemesis, a book that felt like a conversation '
            'between the author and his younger self, an attempt to express in '
            'a single novel the concerns of a lifetime. Treacle Walker does '
            'something similar, cramming into its 150-odd pages more ideas and '
            'imagination than most authors manage in their whole careers. '

{'article': 'Hymnal melodies reverberate around the hillside in Kuwadzana, a '
            'Harare suburb. On a blisteringly hot Saturday, members of the '
            'Apostolic church, dressed in white, hum and sing together. Songs, '
            'long prayers and a little Bible reading punctuate the outdoor '
            'service. It’s a spectacle for passersby. Since the Zimbabwean '
            'government partly reopened church gatherings in August, Apostolic '
            'members, known for their open-air worship, can be seen every '
            'weekend around the capital. The government has asked religious '
            'groups to endorse the Covid-19 vaccine. The Catholic church, '
            'evangelical and adventist groups have done so.\n'
            'But with a tradition of not seeking or trusting medical help, '
            'some of the “white garment” churches are refusing to encourage '
            'congregations to get vaccinated. With millions of followers '
            'across southern Africa, the church’s stance could undermine '
            'Zimbabwe’s attempts to vaccinate 60% of the population by '
            'December. “We believe in God, and science is entirely subject to '
            'God’s will,” says Gramaridge Musendekwa, of the Vadzidzi '
            'Apostolic church. “I grew up on my parents’ prayers and I am '
            'passing it down to my children. My family will not take the '
            'vaccine because we are protected by prayers,” says Musendekwa, '
            '38. “I believe we should not be forced to get vaccinated. For us '
            'who grew up without medicine, vaccinations are an insult to our '
            'faith and religion. Surely the authorities can achieve whatever '
            'they want to do without involving us.”\n'
            'The Apostolic position threatens the success of vaccination '
            'programmes in southern Africa, according to research published in '
            'the Journal of Religion and Health in 2017, which linked it '
            'directly to the rise of measles outbreaks in 2009 to 2010. More '
            'than 85% of Zimbabweans identify as Christian, and 37% belong to '
            'the Apostolic church. It is 2pm on a Saturday and no one at St '
            'Peters Apostolic church in Harare is wearing a '
            'government-mandated face mask. After spending hours at a shrine, '
            'decorated with red and white flags, Miriam Mushayabasa, 34, a '
            'mother-of-three, believes she does not need a vaccine. “Our '
            'preacher gave us a clear instruction that if we use these little '
            'stones and holy water he prayed for, nothing will happen to our '
            'families. Since Covid-19 began last March, my family and I have '
            'never suffered from this disease, we are as strong as ever,” says '
            'Mushayabasa.\n'
            '“My children are strong, so I have no cause to fear. I have '
            'always believed in prayers and this is how I choose to go through '
            'this pandemic.” While the government mandates only the vaccinated '
            'can attend religious services, it is tough to enforce in the '
            'Apostolic churches, who meet outdoors on hilltops and in fields. '
            'Zimbabwe’s vaccination programme has inoculated 15% of the '
            'population since it began in February. It is one of 15 African '
            'countries to have achieved the World Health Organization target '
            'of 10% of citizens by September. Regular vaccine consignments are '
            'arriving from China, but the government says misinformation and '
            'general mistrust have slowed the vaccination programme.\n'
            'Prosper Chonzi, Harare’s health services director, says the '
            'authorities are running campaigns on the benefits of vaccination '
            'to increase take-up. “Our efforts to continue engaging them [the '
            'church] are there, and now there is more literature. It was more '
            'people getting sceptical about the vaccine. There is more '
            'knowledge about the vaccine.” Aaron Chakaipa, 40, reflecting the '
            'fears of his fellow Apostolic members, says, “I heard that if you '
            'get vaccinated, you will not be fertile any more. I am really '
            'scared to take it. “I believe an individual should make a '
            'personal decision and not be cajoled into taking the vaccination. '
            'Telling people to stay away from church if they are not '
            'vaccinated is the same as forcing the vaccination, which is not '
            'right.” However, Andby Makururu, bishop and founder of the Johane '
            'Fifth of Africa Apostolic church in the eastern Manicaland '
            'province, is encouraging his members to get vaccinated.\n'
            '“We are transforming the indigenous church to suit global '
            'standards. Johane the Fifth of Africa has been on a vaccination '
            'drive. In all our preachings, we encourage members to get '
            'vaccinations because the Holy Spirit does not cure all these '
            'diseases. So I am encouraging the Apostolic sect to go to '
            'hospitals and get treatment, I also get treatment and regular '
            'checkups,” he says. He says sects who deny the benefits of '
            'vaccines are out of touch. “Our children are getting vaccinated. '
            'Those that are still behind are lagging but we are moving with '
            'the times,” Makururu says.',

{'article': 'Petrit Halilaj was 13 years old when Serbian troops moved into '
            'his Kosovar village, forcing his family to flee and then burning '
            'their house to the ground. Piling as much as they could on to a '
            'tractor, they took off for his grandfather’s home. When that was '
            'also invaded they moved again, flitting from refuge to refuge '
            'until they arrived at a camp in Albania, where they sat out the '
            'rest of the 15-month war between Serbia and Kosovo. It was there, '
            'in the spring of 1999, that Halilaj met up with the Italian '
            'psychologist who was to change his life. News reached the tent '
            '(in which he was living with his mother, grandfather and four '
            'siblings) that Giacomo “Angelo” Poli was giving out paper and '
            'felt-tip pens to any child who wanted to draw. Before long he was '
            'pouring out images so powerful that the then UN secretary general '
            'Kofi Annan asked to meet him during a visit to the camp. “I’d '
            'grown up with Kofi Annan. He was bigger than Star Wars to me, so '
            'I said to my mum: ‘I can’t show him a little A4 picture,’” '
            'recalls Halilaj. Together they managed to liberate some of the '
            'cardboard used to floor the tents, so he could redraw one image '
            'of a massacre in a village. The original plan was to give the '
            'picture to Annan, but Halilaj’s mind was changed by his '
            'grandfather’s insistence that the visit was no more than a piece '
            'of political theatre. So, while the image was broadcast around '
            'the world, the picture itself stayed in Albania, where Halilaj '
            'only rediscovered it decades later. A year after the war ended, '
            'the family returned to Kosovo. Halilaj was given a scholarship to '
            'art school in Italy, setting him on a course that now brings him '
            'to Tate St Ives for his first solo show in the UK. Though '
            'Angelo’s visit to the camp only lasted two weeks, it was the '
            'start of a lifelong friendship. The two worked together to find '
            'an adult sense in the 35 drawings produced during that fortnight, '
            'which are the basis of Halilaj’s Tate installation. One room '
            'documents his childhood: it not only includes a video of Annan '
            'patting Halilaj’s head as he is shown the picture, but an Andrew '
            'Testa photograph he discovered years later on the New York Times '
            'website, of his little figure, squashed between two plumply '
            'upholstered women, in a food queue at the camp. Their plumpness, '
            'he points out, is the result of many layers of coloured felt that '
            'protected them from the vicious cold, and now plays a signature '
            'role in his art. The installation itself is an enchanted forest '
            'of images, where parrots and peacocks hover over the churned '
            'earth of mass graves and burn you into the mind of a 13-year-old '
            'boy who somehow managed to craft his own salvation from the '
            'trauma of war. As installers stitch the felt cut-outs to the '
            'threads attaching them to the ceiling, the artist runs around '
            'poking feathers in here and there – peacock, chicken, flamingo – '
            '“for those who care to look closely”. “When we talk about the war '
            'in Kosovo, we are not talking about a historical situation that '
            'has been resolved,” says Halilaj. But it is the artist’s role to '
            'find an alternative to “boring diplomacy”. In the end, Halilaj '
            'says, “landscape is what remains and gives us dreams of the '
            'future. So to me this exhibition is not just fragments of 1999 '
            'but fragments of the future, too.” Petrit Halilaj on his Tate '

            'The blanket “This red and yellow cover was over the body of a '
            'three-month-old baby who was killed in the village of Obri, very '
            'close to where we lived. I didn’t put the child in the picture, '
            'because for me it’s an image of a massacre. I didn’t want to show '
            'the victims, because we’re so bombarded by war images. At first '
            'we were told that the soldiers would never hurt children. The '
            'murder of this child and his entire family was the moment when I '
            'started to live with fear on a daily basis.”\n'
            'The burning house “In another part of the installation you can '
            'see our yellow and red house before it all happened, but here '
            'it’s burning to the ground. There’s nothing left of it now. In '
            'the background you can see a soldier and a bulldozer, but in the '
            'foreground are birds in those first colours Angelo gave us. It’s '
            'a way of giving back to him what he gave to us as kids: paper and '
            'colour and space for our imaginations. That was such an amazing '
            'gift.”\n'
            'The peacock “Birds represented to me the colour and joy of my '
            'imagination, even in the worst of places. Behind it you can see '
            'the shadow of a soldier with a knife. It’s up to you which way '
            'you turn: you have either the unfolding of war or the unfolding '
            'of dreams.”\n'
            'The little boy “This little boy is the one figure I have taken '
            'directly from the drawing I made for Kofi Annan. In that, he '
            'stands to one side, with a tank rolling in, watching a massacre. '
            'I didn’t want to put him in the middle because it’s not a '

{'article': 'The most important UN climate change talks since the 2015 Paris '
            'Agreement are upon us, with more than 120 world leaders are '
            'arriving in Glasgow for Cop26. The question now is, amid all the '
            'big talk, will it make a difference? Given that Cop1 was held in '
            '1995 and carbon dioxide emissions are now 14 billion tonnes a '
            'year higher than back then, we can be forgiven for thinking Cop26 '
            'is all a charade. But this time it is different, because it is a '
            'battle not only over reducing carbon emissions, but also over the '
            'rules of a new phase of capitalism that will affect us all. '
            'Governments are facing extreme pressure to act now. Climate '
            'impacts are hitting home. The climate crisis is no longer '
            'abstract and no longer about the future. The heatwaves, floods '
            'and droughts we experience or see in the news, and endless '
            'reports of more to come, make catastrophe easier to imagine. '
            'Public pressure gets ever higher, from Insulate Britain blocking '
            'roads to surveys showing most people are seriously concerned '
            'about the climate emergency. Scientific reports by the '
            'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have unflinchingly '
            'shown that we can only stabilise Earth’s climate by reducing '
            'greenhouse gas emissions to an average of zero, known as net-zero '
            'emissions. This means that the transition away from fossil fuel '
            'energy is not a matter of if, but when. The transition to '
            'powering society using renewables is also now technologically and '
            'economically feasible. The costs of wind and solar have plummeted '
            'to below the cost of building plants to produce electricity '
            'generated by oils and gas, with further falls expected. The '
            'economic argument for inaction is now gone. Given that countries '
            'and companies have left it to the last possible second to take '
            'action, and the stakes are sky high, an avalanche of '
            'announcements are arriving. What should we make of them? The '
            'bewildering complexity of the Glasgow talks can be seen, at its '
            'simplest, as a battle among three major blocs of countries, '
            'companies and protest movements. They aren’t formal groupings and '
            'don’t negotiate together, but can be grouped as they want similar '
            'outcomes. The first is composed of the income poor and vulnerable '
            'countries, marginalised communities and the protestors who will '
            'be outside the SEC as negotiations take place. They want urgent '
            'action to limit warming to 1.5°C, the finance to achieve this, '
            'and a plan to adapt to climate change. Equity is at the heart of '
            'their demands. The second bloc want to delay climate action by '
            'almost any means necessary. These are extractive states, such as '
            'Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Australia, and their allies in the '
            'fossil fuel and airline industries. The third bloc want a '
            'transition to net zero that consolidates their position of power '
            'in the world. This is composed of the EU, US, and China, big '
            'companies such as Unilever and Amazon, along with much of the '
            'financial industry. Aside from China they all argue for markets '
            'to deliver net zero efficiently. The three-way battle has already '
            'led to some surprising and rapid changes. Countries accounting '
            'for some 77% of global carbon dioxide emissions are now covered '
            'by mid-century net zero announcements, including countries '
            'traditionally hostile to climate action, including Saudi Arabia, '
            'Russia, and Australia, as well as the US, EU, UK and China. But '
            'why are climate delayers voluntarily announcing net zero targets? '
            'This may be a mix of global opprobrium from the first bloc and '
            'plain cynicism because they think they won’t face the '
            'consequences of missing these targets. However, it is also likely '
            'to be because within the third bloc the EU have agreed, and the '
            'Democrats in the US have proposed, “carbon border adjustments” to '
            'impose tariffs on high carbon imports. This means exporter '
            'countries will need to reduce their emissions to access these '
            'huge markets. This battle to shape the future will continue in '
            'Glasgow as countries negotiate rules on transparency, which would '
            'allow the UN to check what various nations are doing to achieve '
            'their targets. Negotiations on the rules governing carbon markets '
            'will also be tense. The prospect of interlinked markets for a new '
            'fungible global commodity – carbon – is a bonanza that banks and '
            'the financial industry are pushing for. But many are wary that '
            'carbon accounting tricks will trump real emissions reductions. '
            'Overall, there are serious problems with the seemingly sensible '
            'thinking of bloc three: that if governments in the core zones of '
            'the global economy invest to kick-start a green industrial '
            'revolution, then the market will drive down prices for new '
            'technological solutions that outcompete fossil fuels and drive '
            'down emissions, and carbon border adjustments will bring the '
            'world with them. Critically, this will not be anywhere near '
            'enough to shut down most of the fossil fuel industry and actually '
            'resolve the climate problem. Stopping new exploration for fossil '
            'fuels needs to go hand-in-hand with investing in alternatives. '
            'Yet, many governments who set themselves up as rational followers '
            'of the science are self-delusional. They cut emissions at home '
            'while also licensing yet more oil, coal and gas for export. '
            'Norway, the UK, the US and Canada are all doing this. A perhaps '
            'more fundamental problem of the EU, US and UK market-driven '
            'approach is that markets are not fair. The Covid vaccines scandal '
            'has shown how new technology and market approaches have left '
            'billions vulnerable. Unprecedented international cooperation is '
            'needed to tackle the climate crisis. And within countries, if the '
            'transition to net zero is not experienced as a fair and just '
            'transition, plans will be derailed and catastrophe beckons. '
            'Glasgow is a pivotal moment. The world cannot afford any more '
            'delays in climate action, so the climate-wreckers must not get '
            'their way. But for the most powerful countries and companies, '
            'they must realise that a transition to net zero can’t be achieved '
            'by relying on markets. They need to listen to the vulnerable '
            'countries and people. Solving the climate crisis needs action '
            'that is both fast and fair. Simon Lewis is professor of global '

{'article': 'The news was horrifying, a parable of inhumanity so grim that it '
            'was destined to go viral. Two weeks ago, police said that '
            'passengers on Philadelphia’s elevated train watched a man rape a '
            'woman and did not intervene – and that some riders might have '
            'even recorded the 13 October attack with their cellphones. These '
            'onlookers did not call for help during the attack. The only '
            'person who dialed 911 was an off-duty transit worker, police '
            'alleged.\n'
            '“I’m appalled by those who did nothing to help this woman,” '
            'Timothy Bernhardt, superintendent of the Upper Darby Township '
            'police department, said on 16 October. “Anybody that was on that '
            'train has to look in the mirror and ask why they didn’t intervene '
            'or why they didn’t do something.” Bernhardt said the passengers '
            'who stood idly by might even face criminal charges, according to '
            'the Philadelphia Inquirer. Transit authorities made similar '
            'statements and the story rapidly spread around America and then '
            'the world as a grim symbol of an uncaring society, obsessed with '
            'social media over helping a victim being attacked. But, it now '
            'seems, the story was not entirely accurate. In fact, the story is '
            'far more complex, revealing not only a brutal crime, but how a '
            'mistaken narrative ran wild in the press. At the same time, the '
            'appalling rape does reveal social problems in America, but they '
            'center around crime, the pandemic and policing, not the baleful '
            'influence of social media. The Delaware county district attorney, '
            'whose office is prosecuting the case against alleged rapist '
            'Fiston Ngoy, said this portrayal of bystanders callously videoing '
            'the crime was “simply not true”. The prosecutor, Jack '
            'Stollsteimer, said it was wrong for authorities and media to '
            'advance the narrative that people were “callously sitting there '
            'filming and didn’t act”, calling this “misinformation”. While '
            'Ngoy’s alleged interactions with the victim took place over a '
            '40-minute period, starting with unwanted talking and then '
            'groping, the rape lasted about six minutes. Other riders were not '
            'on the train for the entire duration of their interaction, and '
            'might not have known what was happening, Stollsteimer said. '
            'Surveillance video from the train revealed two passengers raised '
            'their phones toward the assault, and that one of those provided '
            'their video to authorities, AP said.\n'
            'The dramatic turn of events has raised questions about how the '
            'original narrative took off, and why it might have staying power. '
            'There is no single answer – explanations are multifaceted and '
            'nuanced, ranging from police accountability to broad societal '
            'fears to longstanding concerns over public safety. But one '
            'definitive starting point is the Kitty Genovese case. The 1964 '
            'murder of Genovese in New York City rose to international '
            'notoriety after a New York Times report claimed that nearly 40 '
            'people witnessed her being attacked and didn’t try to help her. '
            'The incident prompted extensive study, and the so-called '
            '“bystander effect” – a notion that when everyone thinks that '
            'someone else will act, nobody does – became de rigueur in '
            'psychology coursework. Many years later, it emerged that the '
            'Times’ description of bystanders was incorrect. Far fewer people '
            'had actually witnessed Genovese’s murder than was reported and '
            'some did contact authorities. One of Genovese’s neighbors went '
            'out to help her, cradling the dying 28-year-old while waiting for '
            'paramedics. Most glaringly, an ambulance came to the scene '
            '“precisely because neighbors had called for help”, the New Yorker '
            'said in explaining how the original narrative was debunked. '
            'Indeed, present-day research on bystanders stands in opposition '
            'to initial police accounts about the Septa passengers. A study '
            'based on closed-circuit television footage of 200 violent crimes '
            'across three countries found that “in 90% of those cases, '
            'bystanders did intervene”, explained Elizabeth Jeglic, a '
            'professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice '
            'in New York City.\n'
            '“So the bystander effect, as we had known it or had taught it for '
            'decades, may not be applicable today,” Jeglic said. “There are '
            'various factors that go into people acting and reacting, but for '
            'the most part, if the crime is clear, and it’s a serious crime, '
            'in almost all cases people will intervene.” When bystanders are '
            'worried about their own safety, or physically incapable of '
            'intervening, they might step in by going for help or calling the '
            'police. Some have hypothesized that bystanders’ filming might '
            'even be an attempt at intervention. “They may be trying to help '
            'in videotaping it because it may be helpful in the prosecution of '
            'the crime later on,” Jeglic said. Roy Peter Clark, senior scholar '
            'at the Poynter journalism institute in St Petersburg, Florida, '
            'said the concept of “master narrative” – effectively, cultural '
            'motifs that really stick – helps explain why the initial story '
            'resonated, even if facts ultimately don’t add up. “That’s what '
            'makes it a master narrative – other stories are rejected as false '
            'or misleading or misinformation if they don’t fit the particular '
            'narrative,” said Clark, who has written about and discussed the '
            'Genovese case. Genovese’s story appeared to prove a story about '
            '“the loss of community, urban isolation and alienation”, not to '
            'mention the decline of good samaritanism. The same thing may have '
            'been at play with the Septa attack. “It may be magnified by the '
            'current moment – pandemic, catastrophic weather, economic '
            'disruption, people being unable to exercise the normal '
            'constructive communal rituals of a community and a society,” '
            'Clark said. “Whatever darkness there is in these master '
            'narratives, they may have been magnified by our collective '
            'current experience.” Jeglic voiced similar sentiments, saying: '
            '“We are in a period of time where everything is very polarized '
            'and we often jump to conclusions without considering all aspects '
            'of situations. “A lot of people want to be drawn to the narrative '
            'that there’s a lot of doom and gloom in humanity, that people are '
            'acting in very negative ways.” But to dismiss the story would '
            'also be a mistake, say the people who actually live in the '
            'communities served by Septa and who ride its trains. Septa '
            'passengers in Philadelphia and the suburb of Upper Darby didn’t '
            'find the notion of uncaring bystanders all that implausible, '
            'based on their own concerns about safety predating the rape. When '
            'presented with the fact that initial descriptions of uncaring '
            'bystanders appeared to be untrue, the consensus was that it made '
            'little difference. “There’s no way you cannot see a sexual act,” '
            'said Victoria Evans, 38. “I would have rather taken my chances '
            'intervening than not saying anything.” Evans, a certified nurse’s '
            'assistant, said that body language should have made people think '
            'twice about what they saw. “It would look uncomfortable. You can '
            'tell the difference. There’s no way nobody knew something was '
            'wrong.” “I was really sad because I take the [train] everyday,” '
            'said Nasherah Tucker, 18. “I don’t really feel safe anywhere in '
            'Philadelphia, especially as a woman.” Tucker said the fact that '
            'the rape took place in public, on a train, was incredibly '
            'disheartening. Even if the original police account regarding '
            'bystanders weren’t true, she said, “I think someone should have '
            'definitely said something.” Many passengers, many of them people '
            'of color and especially women, do find riding public transport in '
            'the city a scary experience, where crime seems possible and a '
            'police presence seems thin on the ground. “It was a mix of both '
            'being surprised and not being surprised,” said Noor Rana, a '
            '19-year-old biology student, of her reaction to the incident. “I '
            'was kind of scared – scared for myself, for other women my age. '
            '“Go tell the police. Get to another car. There’s so many things '
            'that you could do,” she said. “I don’t think there’s any excuse '
            'not to do anything.” Would she feel differently about the '
            'bystanders if they didn’t know what was happening, as authorities '
            'have now said? “This is Philadelphia. Crazy stuff happens, so I '
            'feel a lot of people tend to ignore stuff,” she said. Even if '
            'people mistakenly thought the encounter were consensual, they '
            'should have notified authorities, because “it’s still indecent”. '
            'Some of those interviewed said that there needed to be a greater '
            'police presence on the the transport network. “They get paid to '
            'protect the public. You don’t see them do anything. Police don’t '
            'patrol inside trains,” said Esdras Taylor, 46. “The public is not '
            'going to do it. They should be doing their jobs.” But in the '
            'aftermath of the attack, even before Stollsteimer provided more '
            'information, some residents remained optimistic.\n'
            'Jenice Armstrong, a metro columnist with the Inquirer, did not '
            'believe the description of bystanders originally put forth by '
            'police. “It took me a while to write something,” Armstrong said '
            'in an interview. “I thought about it every day after I heard the '
            'initial report, but I just kept trying to picture it and I '
            'couldn’t.” She told herself that there had to be more to the '
            'story. Before Stollsteimer provided the additional information, '
            'Armstrong was working on a column about how something didn’t seem '
            'to add up. Then came word of Stollmeister’s press conference. She '
            'rushed over there. “I was glad I did, because it bolstered my '
            'initial hunch I had – that it didn’t happen the way people were '
            'saying that it happened,” she said. In the column Armstrong wrote '
            'after this information came out, she interviewed Septa police '
            'officer Tom Schiliro, who with his partner apprehended Ngoy when '
            'the train arrived at the 69th Street station. Schiliro told her '
            'that other riders quickly pointed out Ngoy. “As soon as the train '
            'cars opened, everyone was pointing, ‘It’s over there! It’s over '
            'there,’” Schiliro told her. The week before, Schiliro arrested '
            'another man at this station for sexual assault. A good samaritan '
            'hurried to help the victim; Schiliro heard shouting and rushed to '
            'the incident. “People are so quick to believe the worst about '
            'humanity. And ignore the good among us,” Armstrong wrote. “Philly '
            'is a tough, tough city,” she said, “but I would like to think '
            'that it’s not so tough that you have passengers on a train '
            'standing around videotaping a woman being actively raped.”',

            '“Time is running out. The vast majority of politicians will not '
            'be alive to see the worst consequences of the climate crisis, but '
            'those of my generation are keenly aware that we will be the ones '
            'to deal with a crisis we did not create. If ever there has been a '
            'time for selflessness, for leadership in the face of adversity, '
            'it is now. Stand up to multinationals and fossil fuel companies, '
            'to corporate interests weaving their money into political '
            'campaigns. Tax and emissions loopholes allow the largest '
            'polluters, including fossil fuel companies, to move their '
            'emissions around and use smart accounting to hide their emissions '
            'and avoid accepting responsibility. Stand up to those that say '
            'capitalism is the only solution, and dare to think differently. '

            'to lower our standard of living in order to save the world’s '
            'resources. How can we bridge the gap between people’s '
            'expectations and the reality of what one planet can offer, for a '
            'fair distribution? What are the dreams we can dream and what are '
            'the dreams that are someone else’s nightmare? Does lowering our '
            'standard of living necessarily mean lower quality of life? I '
            'think we have to reconsider a lot of the things that we take for '
            'granted: fashion, travel, lifestyle choices like that. Things '

            '“Animal agriculture is one key area which is not sufficiently '

            'world’s farmland and 56% of the greenhouse gas emissions from '

{'article': 'The first lockdown, my family did medium-to-spicy well. It was '
            'me, my husband Mark, [my daughter] Tash and her boyfriend, '
            'Oliver. When the kids were fleeing university in London, and Tash '
            'said, “Is it OK if Oliver and I come down?” Mark and I said, “Of '
            'course!” – thinking that they would be down for three weeks at '
            'the most, like a long school holiday. Five months later, they '
            'were still there. We were very fortunate to be in Cornwall, in '
            'the country – we had more space than some people. We’re a hop, '
            'skip and a jump from the water. There’s a ferocious beauty to the '
            'Cornish coast. There’s the gorgeous beaches, but then there are '
            'the crags and the rocks. There’s something gently brutal about '
            'it. I surrendered to the land at a certain point: OK, I’m in '
            'exile here. I can’t get back to the States, because I don’t know '
            'if I can get back [into the UK] if I go. If I can’t get back to '
            'Mark and Tash, then I’m going to evaporate. Because they are the '
            'reason I wake up in the morning. By the third lockdown, however, '
            'in January of this year, I was not at my best. I was grieving not '
            'playing live for the longest time in my life, not doing what '
            'musicians do. There isn’t the spiritual ceremony of the '
            'collaboration with a live audience. We’re talking about a voltage '
            'that I can’t achieve by myself. That was gone, and there was no '
            'way to recreate that. The closest thing was to go to the ocean '
            'and feel when the tides are coming in and hitting those rocks. '
            'Yes, the sea can be calm and gentle, but when the gales are '
            'blowing, my goodness – now that’s voltage.\n'
            'I became despondent and sad, and filled with loss. You’re trying '
            'to find different coping mechanisms at 50-some years old, and '
            'sometimes not even realising that that’s what you’re needing to '
            'do. And that’s where the songwriting began. The muses said to me: '
            '“Write from where you are. And where you are is on your knees in '
            'a grief and a sadness. You have to start from there.” It was my '
            'own private little hell that I had to write myself out of. At '
            'first, I wrote from the chair I was sitting in, because I '
            'couldn’t get out of it – [I didn’t have] the energy that it took. '
            'I was able to make dinner with Tash. It was something we would '
            'share. But Mark gave up on trying to coax me into the studio. I '
            'don’t need to be by an instrument to write; it’s just not '
            'necessary – it is at a certain point, once I’m exploring the '
            'structures that I’ve thought in my head, but I needed to get out '
            'of this lethargy. The song Metal Water Wood came first. I was '
            'trying to combat this force of despondency, loss – a quagmire of '
            '“What is this that’s zapping us, almost stealing our life force?” '
            'I started reading about Bruce Lee. I don’t know why I was drawn '
            'to him. The muses take me to places sometimes, and it doesn’t '
            'necessarily make linear sense. But he said: “Be like water.” As a '
            'fire being, as a fire creature, that was almost as if I was '
            'betraying the element that has always gotten me through stuff '
            'before. Once it was wintertime and I started going out into the '
            'land, I began to realise I needed to do it more and more. In that '
            'act of engaging with it, it began showing me, it began '
            'collaborating with me, with the songs. And the muses, of course, '
            'were there. I had to say: “OK, I know I’m a guest here, but will '
            'you share your secrets with me?” And the land said to me: “Are '
            'you worthy? What are you going to do with these secrets, Tori? '
            'Will you honour them? Or are you going to bend them to suit your '
            'own needs? Or are you going to be really honest, that this has '
            'broken you?” And I said: “I’m not the mom I want to be. I’m not '
            'the wife I want to be. I’m not the artist I want to be.” And they '
            'immediately rolled their eyes and said: “Oh, please stop with the '
            'dramatic postmenopausal crap.”\n'
            'I want to step out of it, but you have to sometimes admit you’re '
            'not there. You’re in the middle of a complex conundrum. My mom '
            'passed away a couple of years ago. People talk about stages of '
            'grief. And sometimes you have to say: “You know, I miss my mom. '
            'And she’s not here, and I can’t call her. And she would know what '
            'to say.” And then Tash finally walks in the room: “OK, I need my '
            'mom back. I’m sorry you don’t have your mom. I’m really sorry. '
            'And I miss grandma. But I need my mom.” Jesus. Then you go: “OK, '
            'I have to stop being the child missing her mother.” When I was a '
            'child, I would travel by listening to the Beatles’ work and then '
            'playing it at the piano. The music was able to take me to '
            'anywhere in the universe. If the music was right, I could jump on '
            'that sonic spaceship and go. And I had to relearn that skill, but '
            'the trick this time was I needed to write a song in order to try '
            'and find my mom, Mary. She’s in Speaking with Trees and Flowers '
            'Burn to Gold. People have said to me: “I’m not trying to shame '
            'you, T, but you had a mother who had unconditional love. You’ve '
            'experienced that. What a gift. Can you hold on to that gift? She '
            'runs through your veins too, so if you can channel the songs, '
            'can’t you channel her?” And, God, that left me speechless. The '
            'playwright Samuel Adamson, who I worked with on The Light '
            'Princess, sent me a message. He’s such an amazing writer. He '
            'said: “I just had a vision. And I have to tell you, Cornwall’s '
            'protecting you.” I thought, What? And he said: “I’m just giving '
            'you a message. I know this to be true. She’s protecting you. '
            'She’s keeping you safe.” And I felt, OK, then I need to keep her '
            'safe. Not that she needs protecting in that way, but her stories. '
            'I need to give something back to this majestic, compassionate '
            'energy. The way to reflect that energy was a collaboration with '
            'the land, the water and the muses. Trying to give people a '
            'glimpse of this essence that I’ve spent 18 months with. The '
            'mythology of Cornwall feels alive. It doesn’t feel in the past. '
            'If you squint your eyes and don’t look at the cafe on your right, '
            'but look around you, there’s something so ancient about it. You '
            'can kid yourself that Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are going '
            'to show up any moment or Ragnelle is going to show herself. There '
            'is a sense of being protected by something so ancient. I had to '
            'allow it into my bones. • As told to Annie Zaleski. Tori Amos’s '
            'new album, Ocean to Ocean, is out now on Decca.',

{'article': 'Have the spare cash Inflation is running at 3.1%, and finding a '
            'savings account paying above that is impossible. But many experts '
            'claim you can reasonably expect investments to grow by about 4% a '
            'year after fees are taken into account, or more if the stock '
            'market has a strong run. If you invested £50 a month for 10 years '
            'and enjoyed a 3.9% return, you would end up with £7,348, '
            'according to investment firm Fidelity. That’s growth of £1,348 on '
            'your contributions. Carry on for 20 years and your profit rises '
            'to £6,193. If you are in it for the very long term, and are '
            'lucky, your returns may be supercharged thanks to the power of '
            'compounding. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, your investment '
            'earns returns, and those gains are reinvested and start earning '
            'returns, too. However, remember investing means taking some risk '
            '– it’s possible investments could fall in value, so this isn’t '
            'for everyone. First, you need some cash set aside for '
            'emergencies, so allocate some of your savings to that. It’s also '
            'vital to tackle any expensive debt, such as credit or store '
            'cards, before diving into the stock market. Assess your risk '
            'Before choosing where to put your money, decide on your risk '
            'profile. In other words: how comfortable are you with seeing the '
            'value of your investments fall? As a rule, the sooner you need '
            'your money, the less risk you should take. Online investment '
            'providers designed for self-starters, such as Nutmeg, Evestor, '
            'Wealthify, and sustainable investment provider Clim8, simplify '
            'this. Pick from a few investment options, rather than thousands '
            'of funds, after the providers have asked basic questions about '
            'your preferences and goals to match you to suitable options. '
            'Start small Investing a small amount every month is a great way '
            'to get started. You could, say, kick off with £25 a month into a '
            'single fund, although some providers will accept contributions '
            'from as little as £1. Regular investing will help to iron out the '
            'highs and lows of the market. You buy more shares when the stock '
            'market is performing poorly and the price is lower, and fewer '
            'when their value rises. You can invest a lump sum, too, if you '
            'have some cash savings you want to put to work in the stock '
            'market, for example, but this is a higher risk strategy as you '
            'might be buying at the top of the market. Pick funds Rather than '
            'buying shares in individual companies, funds are a good option '
            'for beginners. They hold a range of different companies, so you '
            'don’t have all your eggs in one basket. “When it comes to '
            'choosing funds, I think of personal investors in three broad '
            'camps: ‘choose for me’, ‘help me choose’ and ‘I’ll choose '
            'myself’,” says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity '
            'International. Many investment websites offer best-buy fund lists '
            'put together by experts, including Hargreaves Lansdown’s Wealth '
            'Shortlist, and Interactive Investor’s Super 60. There are two '
            'main fund types: index trackers and active funds. Trackers, also '
            'known as passive funds, follow a particular market index such as '
            'the FTSE 100. They typically return the average of the market '
            'they invest in, and, as there is no one choosing the investments, '
            'they are the cheaper option. Active funds are usually more '
            'expensive as they have a manager who chooses the shares they '
            'hold, aiming to beat the market. You can pick from thousands of '
            'funds, such as those focusing on, for example, sustainable '
            'investments, smaller companies or emerging markets. Holding a '
            'range of funds spreads your money and protects you from market '
            'falls. If one company falls in value, hopefully another will '
            'rise. Go ready-made If you don’t know where to start, you could '
            'go for a single, ready-made fund that holds investments from '
            'around the world. Interactive Investor has a list of six '
            'quick-start funds. “These are well-diversified, multi-asset '

{'article': 'The groundswell of disgust over water firms dumping raw human '
            'sewage into England’s rivers and seas has grown into a roiling '
            'tsunami threatening to overwhelm the government. By their own '
            'confession, water companies say they dumped untreated sewage into '
            'English water bodies more than 400,000 times last year, for a '
            'total of about 3.1m hours. As shocking as that seems, you can '
            'safely assume this figure grossly underplays the true picture '
            'because not all sewage discharges are recorded, and because the '
            'sector is allowed to self-report its spills, a practice that begs '
            'to be abused. Take a look at Southern Water, which was fined £90m '
            'for repeatedly and deliberately dumping raw sewage into seas '
            'along the south coast, while misreporting its performance to the '
            'regulator, the Environment Agency. Or you could ask the data '
            'scientist who has calculated that Thames Water may not be '
            'reporting 95% of its illegal dirty discharges. For its part, '
            'Thames Water says it will look carefully at the findings and '
            'stresses that it regards all untreated sewage discharges as '
            'unacceptable. So how did we get into this mess? When water '
            'companies’ sewerage infrastructure is overwhelmed by sewage and '
            'rainwater, it is dumped into rivers and on to beaches via '
            'combined sewer overflow pipes, rather than allowing it to back up '
            'and cause flooding. In many cases it’s not illegal because the '
            'Environment Agency issues the firms with permits allowing the '
            'discharges on condition that it only happens under “exceptional '
            'circumstances” when there is heavy rainfall – and only then if '
            'the water company is already treating a specified volume of '
            'sewage. But companies are dumping with such appalling regularity, '
            'and during dry weather, that the term “exceptional” has lost all '
            'meaning. But when called out over the horrific pollution, the '
            'sector and the Environment Agency simply point at the creaking '
            'infrastructure they inherited from the Victorians, perhaps not '
            'realising that in doing so they’re demonstrating just how overdue '
            'an upgrade to the system is. It hardly needs saying, but there '
            'are around 27 million more people in the UK now than at the end '
            'of the Victorian era, so you’d think someone somewhere might have '
            'thought about the extra sewerage capacity needed to cope with '
            'that. Apparently not. Since privatisation, the water sector has '
            'paid out billions of pounds in dividends and director salaries '
            'and bonuses, and although it has invested in water treatment it '
            'has not found the cash to stop the rampant pollution. Given that '
            'the financial regulator, Ofwat, has not seen fit to force them to '
            'end it, can we really blame them? They have fiduciary duty to '
            'their shareholders, after all. I’m kidding: of course we can '
            'blame them, but the regulators and successive governments are '
            'also at fault. The half-starved Environment Agency, with its '
            'budget repeatedly slashed, is reduced to accepting whatever '
            'figures the industry supplies to it rather than play the role of '
            'fearsome watchdog. By its own admission, aside from the '
            'occasional prosecution, it can’t take on polluters with paltry '
            'resources, despite the best efforts of its remaining frontline '
            'staff. Meanwhile, the population keeps growing, rainfall '
            'intensifies, and all across the country ugly pipes continue to '
            'spew their nauseating contents into our waters, choking wildlife '
            'and infuriating water users. Fish die, beaches are closed, rivers '
            'run rich with effluent. But things could be about to change – '
            'because the water sector’s dirty little secret is now exposed, '
            'thanks to the hard graft of campaigners who have refused to stop '
            'banging on about it and lockdown-enforced staycations focusing '
            'more people’s minds on the state of the UK’s coastlines and '
            'rivers. So what is the government planning to do about it? '
            'Initially, not much. But public pressure is a powerful thing and '
            'the furore of recent days has embarrassed the government into '
            'making a number of changes to the environment bill that is '
            'currently making its way through parliament. It is keen to show '
            'it is serious about tackling sewage pollution now everyone knows '
            'it’s happening.\n'
            'Over the past few months, the government has been dragged from '
            'its position that giving the water firms a stern ticking off was '
            'all that was needed, to reluctantly adding amendments to the bill '
            'requiring it to make plans to reduce discharges; though these '
            'changes are lacking targets or timelines to make the reforms '
            'concrete. More recently, as part of a parliamentary ping-pong, '
            'the House of Lords demanded stronger action, adding their own '
            'amendment to the bill which would place a duty on “sewerage '
            'undertakers to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated '
            'sewage is not discharged from storm overflows into inland and '
            'coastal waters”. In response, the government has said it intends '
            'to table its own amendment that would place a direct legal duty '
            'on water companies to “progressively reduce the impacts of sewage '
            'pollution from storm overflows”. You’ll notice that “reducing the '
            'impacts of sewage pollution” is not the same as saying it will '
            'require the sector to stop it entirely. The devil, as always, '
            'will be in the detail. The difference this time around is that '

{'article': 'On 4 August 2020, Fouad Elkoury was sitting in his home in Beirut '
            'when an enormous explosion at the port shattered his windows and '
            'blasted through his living room. Miraculously, the Lebanese '
            'photographer survived but his home was destroyed, along with '
            'those of an estimated 300,000 others. “When you go through such '
            'an explosion,” he says, “first, your memory disappears. Second, '
            'your hearing is ruined. And third, you stop planning. Things are '
            'so big, you realise you are nothing. This is where I am at the '
            'moment.” One of Lebanon’s foremost photographers, Elkoury came to '
            'international recognition with his intimate photographs '
            'documenting life during the Lebanese civil war in Beirut in the '
            '1970s and early 80s. Travelling in the years following the '
            'conflict, he found himself aboard the ship carrying Yasser Arafat '
            'during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. He created Atlantis, '
            'a nautical series of images featuring the Palestinian leader. '
            'Typical Elkoury shots juxtapose the personal and the political, '
            'producing images that imbue scenes of everyday life with the '
            'heavy resonance of their often traumatic histories. They include '
            'Portemilio, Lebanon, 1984 – a black and white image of sunbathers '
            'reclining by a fountain at a holiday resort north of Beirut, '
            'while the year the image was taken reminds the viewer that, a few '
            'miles out of the frame, conflict was raging. In Changing the '
            'Wheel, two well-dressed men stare imposingly into the lens while '
            'their driver replaces a tyre. It’s not just a microcosm of social '
            'hierarchies – in the background, you can see the blasted-out '
            'shells of Beirut high rises. Life and its rituals go on, Elkoury '
            'shows, even amid the chaos.\n'
            'We are speaking by phone, since Elkoury has spent the past year '
            'relocated at his family’s “mountain house” in the countryside, '
            'where the electricity and the internet are unreliable. Despite '
            'having spent much of his life on the move, initially coming to '
            'London as a young man to study as an architect, the past two '
            'years have seen him grounded, with his work reaching a new '
            'audience online, largely via the popular Instagram account Middle '
            'East Archive. Founded by Romaisa Baddar, MEA reposts historical '
            'images of the region, and has just released its debut photography '
            'book, comprising Elkoury’s shots of Oman, Palestine, Egypt and '
            'Lebanon from 1980 to 1997. “When Romaisa approached me, I told '
            'her I didn’t have much energy,” says Elkoury. “For two months '
            'after the explosion, I couldn’t do anything because I was so '
            'traumatised. I would rather stay alone and think for myself than '
            'be on Instagram looking at pictures of what people are eating.” '
            'Yet Baddar persisted and Elkoury finally relented. The result is '
            'an intriguing collection of Elkoury’s lesser-known, optimistic '
            'work, from a horse rider in the middle of a busy road talking '
            'with someone through a car window (Jerusalem, 1993), to a man in '
            'a coat leaping wildly in a bid to stop a kid from scoring a goal '
            'during an impromptu football match (Gaza, 1994). The book, also '
            'called Middle East Archive, is full of this quiet poetry of '
            'everyday life: no matter the geopolitical context, Elkoury is '
            'saying, kids still play football. Is that the winning ball of the '
            'match? We will never know.\n'
            'The book, explains Baddar, is intended as a corrective for the '
            'usual depictions of the Middle East. “The Arab world has been '
            'framed mainly through suffering, when that is not all these '
            'places stand for,” she says. “I want to show the region in its '
            'true essence and Instagram is a place where me and a lot of '
            'people of my age get informed. So it felt important to display '
            'something far more joyous than what you would see if you just '
            'Google the Middle East.” Elkoury does not, however, see his work '
            'as a mere journalistic documentation. “If my images just show the '
            'event happening in front of me,” he says, “the meaning of it will '
            'die when the event dies. For my pictures to be preserved in time, '
            'they had to be more symbolic.” Shooting his first images with a '
            'camera pilfered from his father’s desk drawer at the age of six, '
            'Elkoury took a circuitous route into professional photography, '
            'initially becoming an architect. But a return to Beirut in 1979 '
            'coincided with the chaos of the civil war and he began '
            'photographing his surroundings again. “The war was raging and '
            'there was nothing else to do but take pictures,” he says. “I was '
            'scared of the conflict so, rather than head to the frontlines, I '
            'concentrated on what constituted life during the war.”\n'
            'This focus on the personal in a time of massive upheaval is a '
            'recurring theme in his work, most notably in his 2006 series On '
            'War and Love. Here, text is written directly on to his images of '
            'unmade beds, bathroom mirrors and sunlit walls, creating a '
            'startling combination of a diaristic account of a breakup with '
            'the ongoing conflict in Beirut. Just as his lover is absent from '
            'the images, so are the usual bombastic depictions of war. That '
            'series formed part of Lebanon’s first pavilion at the 2007 Venice '
            'Biennale, where Elkoury again exhibited earlier this year with a '
            'new series accompanying works by Lebanese-American poet and '
            'artist Etel Adnan. “I’m continually surprised by the fact that '
            'respectable museums want to display and purchase my work,” '
            'Elkoury says. “I photograph where I live and what I see and feel '
            'and there’s not more to it.”\n'
            'His search for sincerity has seen Elkoury immersing himself in '
            'the places he has chosen to photograph. “Usually when I travel to '
            'a country, I stay for some time – like in Palestine I stayed two '
            'and a half years. I don’t travel for five days. I stay, I rent a '
            'house or flat and slowly get to know the atmosphere and the '
            'mentality of the city. It is interesting to immerse oneself in a '
            'country. But at the same time, it is quite a dangerous move '
            'because you often fall into things you didn’t recognise.” He '
            'pauses. “It’s incredible that I’m still alive. I could have died '
            'six or seven times, just being in places I shouldn’t have been '
            'in.” Elkoury shoots on film. Right now, there is a pile of rolls '
            'waiting to be taken to town and developed. The images they '
            'contain document a therapy of sorts, one he embarked upon after '
            'that fateful explosion last year. Those rolls record the walks he '
            'has been taking through the mountains around him. The act of '
            'taking these photographs – of returning to his craft – have aided '
            'his recovery. “Nature seems to be the only soothing element,” he '
            'says. “It provides eternity.” Middle East Archive is out now.',

            'average temperature rises to 1.5C. In some democracies, such as '
            'the UK, there is at least a consensus that something must be '
            'done; in others, such as Australia, Canada and the US, political '
            'debate rages over the most fundamental questions. Faced with a '
            'problem of these proportions, some are running out of patience. '
            'The veteran Earth scientist James Lovelock puts his faith in '
            'eco-authoritarianism. Climate change is so severe, he has said, '
            'that “it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while”. '
            'Lovelock may state this explicitly, but in my many years of work '
            'on climate policy and politics, I have been struck by how often '
            'people make the same argument implicitly. Bill Gates, in his '
            'breathlessly upbeat book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, '
            'describes how enlightened investment strategies from well-meaning '
            'entrepreneurs could save the day. No need to bother, he implies, '
            'with winning hearts, minds or votes. Then there are those who '
            'look approvingly towards China, a country where the very lack of '
            'democratic accountability, they argue, allows leaders to take '
            'tough and unpopular decisions. The common theme in all these '
            'accounts is that the public are not to be trusted – they do not '
            'understand, or care; they are too selfish, or too shortsighted. '
            'Better to let the experts decide.\n'
            'Yet proposals for some sort of eco-authoritarianism raise more '
            'questions than they answer. How, exactly, do we move beyond '
            'democracy? Who appoints the experts? Scientists may have evidence '
            'at their disposal, but how would they make deeply social '
            'decisions about who wins and who loses? Under whose authority '
            'would they regulate, and how exactly would that regulation happen '
            '– how would laws be made? The best that can be said about these '
            'proposals is that they gloss over the complex realities of '
            'political, social and legal change. There’s also the fact that '
            'authoritarian states have not performed better, historically. A '
            'recent study by the University of Gothenburg’s V-Dem Institute '
            'showed that autocratic regimes lag significantly on climate '
            'action. Given the economic and political might of China, we have '
            'to hope that they find a way to buck this trend – but it would be '
            'reckless, not to mention ethically dubious, to suggest China as a '
            'political role model on climate. Despite the considerable flaws '
            'in our democratic systems, the alternatives crumble under any '
            'sort of close inspection. It is hard to disagree with Churchill’s '
            'pithy summary that “democracy is the worst form of government, '
            'except for all the others”. My experience leads me to a very '
            'different conclusion to that of the eco-authoritarians. The data '
            'just doesn’t support the picture of an uncaring or uninformed '
            'public. Research consistently shows high levels of concern about '
            'climate change, across different ages, demographic groups and '
            'parts of the world. Yet this concern is coupled with a deep '
            'mistrust in government and political elites, and a breakdown in '
            'the means by which people’s priorities are translated into '
            'political action. To generalise, we have a population that is '
            'cynical yet concerned about the climate, frustrated with the '
            'inability of politicians to act decisively in the face of growing '
            'climate impacts.\n'
            'Could it be that the problem here is not too much democracy, but '
            'too little? What if we were to begin with the assumption that '
            'people can and do make sensible decisions if they have the '
            'evidence and the influence that they need? That if we designed a '
            'meaningful dialogue between citizens, experts and governments, we '
            'would get better outcomes? Just before Covid-19 struck last year, '
            'I was part of an incredible experiment that did just this. '
            'Climate Assembly UK was a citizens’ assembly commissioned by '
            'parliament, bringing together a representative group of 108 '
            'citizens. Over a series of weekends, they learned about climate '
            'science, impacts and action; discussed and debated with experts '
            'and each other; and then voted on recommendations. The assembly’s '
            'findings are a coherent, far-reaching set of proposals for '
            'tackling the climate emergency – created by a different sort of '
            'democratic body. Processes such as this aren’t intended to '
            'replace our system of representative democracy, but to make it '
            'work better. They allow citizens and politicians alike to talk '
            'about what they need from each other. Citizens’ assemblies on the '
            'climate crisis have now taken place in Scotland, France, Denmark '
            'and some US states, as well as at a local level in many areas. '
            'They show the potential of a move to a more deliberative '
            'democracy – one which goes beyond the blunt instrument of a vote, '
            'toward an informed conversation. But making democracy work better '
            'for the climate doesn’t just mean hearing more from people. It '
            'means hearing less from those economic interests, such as oil '
            'majors and airlines, that have a stake in the high-carbon status '
            'quo. We’ve recently seen corporations suing governments under '
            'trade law, claiming that climate policy, passed by democratically '
            'elected parliaments, has damaged their profits and is therefore '
            'illegal. US scientist Michael Mann has documented this “new '
            'climate war”. He shows that denial of the scientific facts of '
            'climate change has been replaced with more complex, but equally '
            'insidious, attempts to delay or derail legislation. A key tactic, '
            'Mann shows, is to deflect attention away from the workings of big '
            'companies, and towards individuals, by saying that it is up to '
            'each of us to make the right choices, and reduce our carbon '
            'footprint. When this doesn’t happen, it is a short step to '
            'blaming people for the state we are in, and undermining faith in '
            'the ability of democracies to handle the climate crisis. What is '
            'necessary, then, is not to dispense with democracy, but to double '
            'down on it. Seeing climate change not as something that can be '
            'solved by experts, nor through individual sacrifices – but by the '
            'negotiation of a new sort of social contract between people and '
            'the state. The novelist Amitav Ghosh refers to our current '
            'climate predicament as a “great derangement”, a collective '
            'reluctance to face up to the reality of how the crisis will '
            'affect our lives. Pretending that we can bypass people and '
            'democracy is, to my mind, the ultimate derangement. • Rebecca '

{'article': 'The world’s nations meeting at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow are '
            'tasked with dramatically ramping up action to tackle the climate '
            'emergency. But do their citizens back them? And does the UK, as '
            'host, have a strong public mandate to act? The evidence from '
            'dozens of recent opinion polls is overwhelming: yes. So who is '
            'worried? Most people, everywhere: the biggest ever opinion poll '
            'on climate change, for the UN Development Programme, found '
            'two-thirds saying it is a “global emergency”. Across 50 '
            'countries, a majority in every one agreed. Both the young and the '
            'old agreed: 69% of those aged 14-18 and 58% of those over 60, '
            'indicating there is not a huge generational divide. Another large '
            'poll, for the BBC, showed most people (56%) across 31 nations '
            'want their governments to set stronger targets to address climate '
            'change as quickly as possible, with 36% backing more gradual '
            'action, and just 8% opposing action. In the UK, Ipsos Mori found '
            'that 80% of people think the climate crisis is a global '
            'emergency, with the same proportion blaming human activity. '
            'Concern is rising fast: between 2016 and 2020, the proportion of '
            'people very or extremely worried about climate change jumped from '
            'about 20% to almost 60% among UK citizens over 35 years old, with '
            'those younger going from 30% to 70%. “The UK government can take '
            'heart from the very strong levels of public support for the goals '
            'of the Cop26 summit,” said Bridget Williams at Ipsos Mori. Across '
            'major European nations, anxiety about global heating is as high, '
            'or even higher than in the UK, YouGov polling shows.\n'
            'Is climate concern a worry that only the well-off can afford, as '
            'some opponents of climate action in the UK suggest? Absolutely '
            'not. A poll for Global Future found working class people are just '
            'as likely to be “highly worried” (43%) as the middle class (46%). '
            'The same poll did indicate a gender difference. For example, 40% '
            'of women said they had altered the food they ate to help combat '
            'climate change, compared with 27% of men. The UNDP poll also '
            'found significantly more women and girls were concerned about '
            'global heating in the UK, US, Australia and Canada, though not '
            'elsewhere.\n'
            'Those on the political left often report more climate concern '
            'than those on the right but, even in countries where climate '
            'change has become a very polarised issue, heavy majorities '
            'support action. In the US, for example, 75% of people support '
            'regulating CO2 as a pollutant, according to a survey by the Yale '
            'Program on Climate Change Communication. In the UK, work by WWF '
            'and Demos found levels of support for various climate actions '
            'changed little depending on party loyalty, as did polling for the '
            'New Economics Foundation. How worried are people? Climate change '
            'is the biggest concern for the public in the UK and Europe, ahead '
            'of Covid and the economy, according to recent research by '
            'SecNewgate, although it ranked significantly lower in the US, '
            'Australia and China. Another survey backed the high levels of '
            'concern in Europe, with 81% of EU citizens saying climate change '
            'was the biggest challenge humanity faces this century. A Yale '
            'poll found 66% of people in the US are worried about climate '
            'change. In the UK, most people (56%) believe that climate change '
            'will have a bigger impact on humanity than coronavirus, with the '
            'majority holding across all classes and genders, according to the '
            'polling by the Global Future. Britons do not think stark warnings '
            'about the climate crisis are alarmist: 69% say the threat is not '
            'exaggerated, found YouGov, compared to 17% who think it is. Other '
            'UK polls show climate change consistently ranking highly as an '
            'issue of concern, vying with the economy and health for the top '
            'spot.\n'
            'More than half of UK citizens said “drastic action” is needed, '
            'researchers at the Centre for Climate Change and Social '
            'Transformations (Cast) at Cardiff University found, with similar '
            'levels of concern in China and even higher levels in Brazil. “As '
            'world leaders discuss how they want to fulfil the international '
            'commitment to avoid the worst of the climate crisis, it is '
            'important to understand what citizens expect from their '
            'governments,” said Katharine Steentjes at Cast. “Policymakers '
            'should note that citizens expect their governments to take '
            'responsibility and [implement] effective climate action.” What '
            'action do people want? The UNDP poll, which surveyed over 1 '
            'million people around the world, found the most popular actions '
            'to tackle the climate crisis were protecting and restoring '
            'forests, renewable energy and climate-friendly farming. In '
            'nations where fossil fuels are a major part of the economy, '
            'people strongly supported renewable energy, including the US (65% '
            'in favour), Australia (76%) and Russia (51%). However, while 65% '
            'of Saudi Arabians believe there is a climate emergency, only 30% '
            'support stopping burning fossil fuels. Where the destruction of '
            'forests is a big cause of emissions, people supported '
            'conservation of trees, with 60% support in Brazil and 57% in '
            'Indonesia. In the UK, the biggest analysis of climate policy '
            'preferences ever published in UK, found backing for a carbon tax '
            'on polluting industries, higher levies on flying and grants for '
            'heat pumps. WWF and Demos asked 22,000 people to choose their '
            'favoured mix of policies to hit emissions cuts targets and they '
            'also supported a speed limit of 60mph on motorways and a campaign '
            'to reduce meat eating by 10%. All the policies had between 77% '
            'and 94% public support. Recent YouGov polls also recently asked '
            'Britons about climate action: when taking into account the costs '
            'and possible disruption, 84% supported subsidies to make houses '
            'more energy-efficient. An earlier YouGov/Sky Survey found 50% '
            'backed higher air taxes and banning the sale of petrol and diesel '
            'cars in 2030. The UK’s Office for National Statistics found that '
            'one in four people purchasing a new car in the next year said '
            'they would choose an electric or plug-in hybrid. Governments '
            'often shy away from action that targets people’s behaviour, but a '
            'large survey across the UK and Europe for the European Investment '
            'Bank found more than 70% support for imposing changes on people’s '
            'behaviour to fight climate change. “These demands from the public '
            'are a clear mandate to strengthen our efforts and accelerate the '
            'green transition,” said EIB’s Ambroise Fayolle. Even in the US, '
            '60% say they are willing to drive and fly less, or already do, '
            'and 51% to eat less meat. But don’t most people object when '
            'action, such as a wind farm, is planned in their backyard? The '
            'polling indicates not. Renewable energy is popular – 79% support '
            'in a UK government poll. Another poll, in the UK and nine '
            'European countries, found 67% of people supportive of the '
            'construction of an onshore wind farm near to where they live, '
            'even in rural areas. In contrast 65% of Europeans would oppose '
            'the construction of a new nuclear power station near their home. '
            'A separate poll found those already living within five miles of a '
            'windfarm were just as supportive (70%) as those who did not. '
            'Cutting meat consumption in rich nations is vital to beating the '
            'climate emergency but is seen as one of the most controversial '
            'policies. However, in the UK, 70% of people agree they should '
            'definitely or probably do eat less meat, according to data from '
            'the Centre For Climate Change And Social Transformations, and '
            'Britons have already cut down by 17% in the last decade. '
            'Nonetheless, the promotion of plant-based diets was the least '
            'popular of the 18 policies in the global UNDP survey, with only '
            '30% support, and the idea of a higher taxes on meat was last in a '
            'UK Ipsos Mori poll of eight policies, albeit with 47% support. '
            'Other research has shown that 80% of people in the UK and US '
            'would be open to eating meat grown from cells in a factory. '
            'Another idea seen as controversial is taxing motorists per mile '
            'that they drive. This has been proposed in the UK as one way of '
            'replacing the £37bn-a-year tax revenue from petrol and diesel '
            'sales as more people take up electric cars. But a survey for the '
            'Social Market Foundation found 40% in favour, with 26% opposed. '
            'But what about the cost of action? The UK public is much more '
            'worried about the costs of inaction on climate change, according '
            'to Opinium polling, rather than the costs of action. More than '
            'half (55%) said we can’t afford not to implement climate change '
            'policies, compared with 21% saying that is unaffordable. “You '
            'still need funding to reduce up-front costs, but the view that '
            'normal voters won’t wear action on climate belongs to 2001 not '
            '2021,” said the pollster Steve Akehurst. Almost three-quarters '
            '(72%) of Britons say green products are too expensive for those '
            'on lower incomes, according to an Ipsos Mori poll. But they also '
            'think those people should be protected. The consensus of the '
            '22,000 people participating in the WWF-Demos work was a suite of '
            'policies leaving people earning under £22,000 a year better off, '
            'thanks to redistribution of a carbon tax and savings on heating '
            'and car bills. Tax rises to fight climate change found support in '
            'a Savanta ComRes poll, with 67% of UK citizens saying that would '
            'be acceptable, and only 22% saying the reverse.\n'
            'Just over half of UK people (51%) believe the household cost of '
            'tackling global heating will be larger than any savings from '
            'things like lower heating and petrol bills over one year, but '
            'they expect the trade-off to be more favourable in 10 years’ '
            'time. “Britons seem to be prepared for hair shirts. They just '
            'don’t want to wear them forever,” the Economist concluded. Who '
            'has the most responsibility for fixing climate change? In the UK, '
            '34% put the most responsibility on the government, compared with '
            'the general public (26%) and businesses (19%), according to the '
            'government’s own data. But YouGov polling shows only 13% of '
            'people think politicians are genuinely interested in tackling the '
            'climate emergency. Instead, most thought politicians were only '
            'trying to maintain a positive public image for themselves (68%). '
            'Surveys in the UK and nine other European countries found only '
            '18% of people thought their government was doing “all they '
            'realistically can to tackle climate change”. Another large '
            'European survey found 58% believing their country would fail to '
            'drastically reduce its CO2 emissions by 2050. There is strong '
            'support for the Cop26 goals among UK citizens, according to Ipsos '
            'Mori research, but low confidence that the government will '
            'deliver on climate. Over half (55%) are not confident that the '
            'government will take the actions needed in the next few years, '
            'compared with 40% that are confident. What can we conclude? In '

{'article': 'Eddie Jones has always felt like an outsider, and still does. “An '
            'Australian coaching in England rugby,” the England rugby head '
            'coach tells me in the latest episode of Life Lessons: From Sport '
            'and Beyond. “In Japan, half-Japanese – you’re an outsider.” Born '
            'in Tasmania to a Japanese-American mother and Australian father, '
            'as a boy he lived in La Perouse, a south-eastern Sydney suburb. '
            'There were around 30 children in his school class. “Twenty-six '
            'Anglo-Saxons, three aboriginal kids and myself.” Jones’s mother '
            'would make him take presents whenever he visited someone else’s '
            'house, a Japanese custom he found uncomfortable. “Other people '
            'could never understand why that was done. So, you were '
            'different.”\n'
            'Growing up feeling like an odd-man-out helped to shape Jones’s '
            'eventual career choices. “I wanted to be good at sport, because I '
            'wanted to be part of something.” Rugby was his ticket in. While '
            'he was not physically imposing – estimates of Jones’s height vary '
            'from 5ft 3in to a somewhat unlikely 5ft 8in – he had other '
            'skills, including a talent for sledging. “I would be quite fast '
            'with my lip, so there was a role for me to play in the team.” '
            'While Jones played against the British & Irish Lions for New '
            'South Wales B in 1989, he never made it into Australia’s first '
            'team. Some have suggested that was a chastening experience that '
            'left a mark and a point to prove. As a coach, he has led teams to '
            'two Rugby World Cup finals, the first with Australia in 2003, '
            'when his side were pipped by Sir Clive Woodward’s England. “That '
            'defeat was easier to take than 2019 [when England lost against '
            'South Africa],” Jones admits, adding that, while he doesn’t like '
            'to lose, “if we played close to our best and got beaten that '
            'would have been easier to accept.” As a leader, Jones prides '
            'himself on his observational skills, which he admits were borne '
            'of that feeling of not quite fitting in while growing up. That '
            'prompts the question, what has he observed about English culture '
            'that surprises him? “How complicated and complex it is, and I’m '
            'still trying to work it out,” he says. “England has a history as '
            'a colonial power, and now people are trying to dissociate '
            'themselves from that. “There’s a bit of a small-island mentality. '
            'And I see that in Japan as well, where people don’t want to '
            'offend each other. They really want to get on and sometimes, that '
            'can make relationships quite difficult because it’s harder for '
            'people to be honest. And the thing that strikes me is how often '
            'English people say, ‘to be honest’ or ‘to be fair’. Why? What '
            'else would you be? “There’s a desire to be polite and fit in with '
            'what’s going on in the moment. Until alcohol comes into it. '
            'Alcohol has a remarkable change on behaviour here, more so than '
            'even [with] Australians.” Having spent time coaching and living '
            'in Australia, Japan, and England, Jones believes there is one '
            'Japanese habit that could enrich English culture. “One of the '
            'customs I really like in Japan – and my [Japanese] wife’s really '
            'big on it – is that wherever you go, you have got to leave that '
            'area better than it was. It’s such a harmonious and simple thing '
            'to do that’s better for society. If you go to a park, don’t leave '
            'it in worse condition. Leave it in a better condition.”\n'
            'When Jones was first given the England job, there were some who '
            'said he would be a short‑term appointment; the sort of person to '
            'get quick results before burning out. Jones has been there nearly '
            'six years now, through ups and downs including the dismal '
            'fifth‑place finish in the Six Nations last season. His hardline '
            'methods have been controversial and at times divisive, and there '
            'has been high turnover rate among the coaching staff. But Jones '
            'insists he wants his players to know he cares about them, and '
            'that he’s trying to move them – and subsequently the team – to a '
            'better place, via an “arm around the shoulder” or “a couple of '
            'tough words”. Jones has also been quick to dispense with the '
            'services of several stalwarts who have served him well throughout '
            'his English tenure. Several big names have been cast aside for '
            'the autumn internationals including the Vunipola brothers Billy '
            'and Mako, George Ford and Jamie George. A new generation '
            'featuring players such as Marcus Smith, Louis Lynagh and Sam '
            'Simmonds have been given the opportunity to spearhead Jones’s '
            'next crack at the World Cup. When asked recently to nominate his '
            'top five career moments, Jones left one place clear for the 2023 '
            'World Cup final in France. He has confirmed he will stand down '
            'after that tournament, by which time he will have been the '
            'country’s longest‑serving head coach. Jones insists his priority '
            'is to ensure England are better off than when he was brought in. '
            '“The main thing for me is how I leave England. I want to make '
            'sure I leave England always thinking they should be top three in '
            'the world. That will be a job well done.” When I point out how '
            'that chimes in with the Japanese trait of seeking to leave a '
            'place better off that when you arrived, Jones pauses. “I’ve never '
            'actually thought about it like that. But that’s true.” • Simon '

{'article': 'When the New York Jets needed one yard with two minutes left to '
            'secure a stunning 34-31 upset over the Cincinnati Bengals on '
            'Sunday, the football stayed in Mike White’s hands. It had to. '
            'White’s successful quarterback sneak was the perfect ending to a '
            'game that showcased how nothing in the NFL is certain. Two weeks '
            'ago, very few people outside of the Jets universe had even heard '
            'of White – quite frankly, I kept envisioning the former Raiders '
            'head coach. White erased any confusion over his identity with a '
            'brilliant performance, especially as far as Jets quarterbacks go. '
            'His 405 passing yards were the most by a Jets quarterback in 327 '
            'games. That dates back to the year 2000. His 37 completions (out '
            'of 45 attempts) are an NFL record for a player in his first '
            'start. White also tied Cam Newton as the only player to top 400 '
            'passing yards in his first start. White also magically brought '
            'the Jets back from a 10-point deficit on two separate occasions, '
            'including during the fourth quarter. And executed a Philly '
            'Special two-point conversion to give the Jets the late, decisive '
            'three-point lead.\n'
            'The fairytale of a player like White coming out of nowhere is '
            'why, despite its many troubles, the NFL continues to draw us in. '
            'White was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round of the '
            '2018 draft. He lost a battle for the backup job behind Dak '
            'Prescott and was waived in 2019 when the team decided to carry '
            'just two quarterbacks. Then the Jets swooped in and signed White, '
            'though it’s been a rocky relationship. Since 2019, White has been '
            'cut four times, and signed and waived and re-signed and moved to '
            'the active roster 11 times. White’s performance led to the home '
            'fans at MetLife chanting his name. For now, the 26-year-old '
            'should enjoy the adulation – because the NFL has only a few '
            'examples of quarterbacks emerging from obscurity to sustained '
            'success. Kurt Warner famously quit football and stocked shelves '
            'at a grocery store when he was waived by the Packers before what '
            'would be a Hall of Fame career. But what makes Warner’s story so '
            'compelling is that it is the exception rather than the rule. '
            'Whatever White’s long-term merits turn out to be, the fact that '
            'he beat a team that were competing for the AFC No 1 seed heading '
            'into the weekend raises a serious question. How can the Jets go '
            'back to Zach Wilson, currently sidelined by injury? The Jets, of '
            'course, drafted Wilson as the No 2 overall pick this spring with '
            'the idea that he would be their quarterback of the future (and '
            'the present). While it’s still very early in Wilson’s career, '
            'it’s safe to say no one in Canton is thinking about fitting him '
            'for a gold jacket any time soon: he currently sits 32 out of 33 '
            'eligible quarterbacks in ESPN’s QBR rankings. Jets head coach '
            'Robert Saleh told reporters after the game that White will start '
            'for the Jets against the Colts on Thursday night. More telling, '
            'when asked if White could be the long-term solution at '
            'quarterback, Saleh replied: “Anything is possible.” Perhaps Saleh '
            'was merely caught up in the revelry after a resounding win and '
            'will need to backtrack for the sake of Wilson’s psyche. Or maybe '
            'White really did make the first step to winning the starter’s job '
            'on Sunday. Because, as he showed us, anything is possible in this '
            'league. MVP of the week\n'
            'Matthew Stafford, quarterback, Los Angeles Rams. Stafford '
            'continues to thrive under center on a Rams team overflowing with '
            'weapons and strong coaching. In Sunday’s 38-22 win over the '
            'Texans (which was much more of a blowout than the final score '
            'suggests), Stafford was nearly flawless with 305 yards and three '
            'passing touchdowns (without playing in the fourth quarter). It’s '
            'not just the great system Stafford entered, it’s his command of a '
            'complicated offense and his elite ability to read defenses. '
            'Exhibit A: By the end of the first quarter, Stafford had already '
            'surpassed Jared Goff’s touchdown total for the Rams last season. '
            'Video of the week Best Broncos pass of the season? Peyton '
            'Manning, who was inducted in the Broncos Ring of Honor on Sunday, '
            'showed he still has some life left in that arm after all.\n'
            'Stat of the week This week it was revealed that Dallas Cowboys '
            'receiver CeeDee Lamb has been fined by the NFL a whopping FIVE '
            'times in six games this season. That might lead you to conclude '
            'that Lamb has serious behavioral issues. But Lamb’s egregious '
            'crimes include: Having his jersey untucked ($5,510 v the Eagles; '
            '$15,450 v the Panthers). Failing to have his socks cover his '
            'lower leg ($5,510 v the Bucs in the season opener). Waving after '
            'his game-winning touchdown ($10,300 v the Patriots). Lamb was '
            'also fined for an illegal crackback block which, OK, is a fair '
            'penalty. But everything else? The NFL is loaded with examples of '
            'greed, but none may be more so than its list of fines. The '
            'pettiness of the league’s attempts to strip players of their '
            'individuality has been known for a while but seeing it manifest '
            'in fines like Lamb’s is a reminder of the ickiness. Quote of the '
            'week “I need to step away from football at this time and focus on '
            'my mental wellbeing” – Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin '
            'Ridley. Ridley’s heartfelt explanation of his absence is the '
            'latest in a string of athletes being open about their mental '
            'health struggles. Just before Ridley released this statement, the '
            'NFL on Fox aired a riveting segment with Eagles tackle Lane '
            'Johnson about what it’s like to live with anxiety and depression. '
            'The more we see athletes as humans, the better. Elsewhere around '
            'the league • Trevor Siemian’s Saints beat Tom Brady’s Buccaneers '
            '36-27. Let that simmer for a moment. Siemian hadn’t played since '
            '2019. He beat Brady – Tom Freaking Brady – who has played almost '
            'nonstop for around 472 years. In fairness Siemian, who entered '
            'the game in the second quarter when Jameis Winston was injured, '
            'wasn’t as critical to the Saints’ win as White was for the Jets. '
            'But he played well enough in a tough situation, with 159 passing '
            'yards and a touchdown. It was the Bucs and Brady who shot '
            'themselves in the foot throughout. They committed 11 penalties '
            '(to the Saints’ two) including a taunting call on Devin White on '
            'third-down deep in the final quarter that kept the Saints alive '
            'and led to a go-ahead field goal. For his part, Brady lost a '
            'fumble and threw two interceptions, including a pick six that '
            'sealed the game for New Orleans.\n'
            '• Back to that Winston injury. It sounds like he could be out for '
            'a while. “I cried when I saw him coming in,” said Saints head '
            'coach Sean Payton. “It’s hard.” The injury came after a '
            'horse-collar tackle from former teammate Devin White. “I hate '
            'that this happened to you, man,” White told Winston after the '
            'injury. “Because you’re playing good ball and just praying for '
            'you.” • More backup quarterback heroics in Minnesota. Where '
            'Cooper Rush stepped in for the injured Dak Prescott and led the '
            'Dallas Cowboys to victory over the Vikings. Rush threw for 325 '
            'yards and led an impressive touchdown drive late in the game to '
            'secure a 20-16 victory. The Cowboys are now 6-1 this season and '
            'firmly in control of the NFC East. • Both San Francisco and '
            'Chicago entered Sunday with major questions at quarterback. The '
            '49ers won 33-22, which doesn’t greatly matter since neither of '
            'these teams are shaping up as playoff contenders. But both Jimmy '
            'Garoppolo and Justin Fields gave performances that should please '
            'each fanbase. Garoppolo was efficient, decisive, and accurate. He '
            'ended the day with a very clean 322 passing yards (171 of which '
            'were to Deebo Samuel) and no turnovers. Even in a loss, this game '
            'may have been more monumental for Fields, who finally showed us '
            'his dynamic playmaking skills. Entering Sunday, the Bears had '
            'only designed eight run plays for Fields. Against San Francisco, '
            'Fields was let loose. He rushed for 103 yards and a score (on top '
            'of 175 passing yards). And in what felt like his true welcome to '
            'the NFL moment, Fields showcased his athleticism and instincts on '
            'an incredible touchdown run.\n'
            '• It was another tough day for anyone trying to understand the '
            'roughing the passer rule. Every week, without exception, there '
            'are flags thrown on questionable calls. A defender rolling over a '
            'quarterback to avoid his head. Or giving him a light shove to '
            'avoid deeper contact. Sunday saw some of the inverse, the '
            'non-calls. There was a very late hit on Mac Jones that was '
            'allowed to fly. More egregiously, Steelers kicker Chris Boswell, '
            'who had become a passer on a fake field-goal, was demolished by '
            'Browns DE Jordan Elliott on a clear roughing the passer that went '
            'unpenalized. Boswell had to go to the locker room to be evaluated '
            'for a concussion. Let’s please get some consistency. • Jaguars '
            'head coach (for now) Urban Meyer really said: “I didn’t see that '
            'coming,” after one of the biggest coaching shitshows you’ll ever '
            'see in the NFL. Among the highlights of the Jags’ 31-7 loss to '
            'the Seahawks were consecutive penalties for 12 men of the field. '
            'And when his team finally scored with less than two minutes '
            'remaining, Meyer kicked an extra point that was followed by an '
            'onside kick. Does he want to win or not?',

            'While Joyce and Canavan attempted to minimise the significance of '
            'Australia’s decision, the Australian foreign minister, Marise '
            'Payne, took a step towards repairing the relationship with '
            'France. On Monday Payne met for more than an hour with the French '
            'ambassador, Jean-Pierre Thébault, who returned to Canberra after '
            'being recalled to Paris for consultations at the height of the '
            'diplomatic crisis. When he left Canberra in September, Thébault '
            'told Guardian Australia: “We thought we were mates and we were '
            'stabbed in the back.” Payne said Monday’s in-person meeting was '
            '“constructive” and added that Australia was “focused on moving '
            'forward in our relationship with France”. “This is another '
            'important step in that process, building on discussions between '
            'our countries’ leaders,” Payne said. “Australia looks forward to '
            'regular engagement continuing.” Thébault has yet to comment on '
            'the outcome of the meeting, but he is scheduled to address the '
            'National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday. Labor’s foreign '
            'affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, welcomed the meeting, but said '
            'Payne’s efforts would be “undermined and damaged by what the '
            'prime minister has done and how he is now dealing with it”. “It '
            'is unprecedented to see a world leader so bluntly assert that we '
            'are led by a man whose word he doesn’t trust,” Wong told ABC TV.\n'
            'Wong said France was an important power in the Indo-Pacific and '
            'Macron would take a leadership role in the EU after the '
            'retirement of German chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the '
            'Australian government should have ensured it managed the issue in '
            'a way “that minimises disruption to our relationship with '
            'France”, adding: “On what possible planet is a good idea for us '
            'to have a stoush with them?” The Labor senator Kristina Keneally '
            'told Sky News that Joyce was “not exactly helping here” and '
            'asked: “Are there any adults in this government? I mean, come '
            'on!” The dispute with France dominated Morrison’s trip to Rome '
            'for the G20 summit. Shortly after Morrison arrived in Italy, US '
            'president Joe Biden moved to repair his own damaged personal and '
            'political relationship with Macron by acknowledging that the '
            'Aukus announcement had been a “clumsy” episode handled with a '
            'lack of grace. Biden told Macron with television cameras present '
            'that he was “under the impression that France had been informed” '
            'about Australia’s intention to ditch the contract “long before” '
            'the Aukus partnership was revealed publicly. Morrison denied he '
            'had lied to the French president. He said he had told Macron that '
            'he had formed the view that conventional submarines would not '
            'meet Australia’s strategic interests when the two leaders met in '
            'Paris after a G7 summit in June. He said when the two had dined '
            'together at the Élysée Palace in June, “at that stage we had not '
            'concluded any other arrangements with any other parties”. '
            'Morrison said he understood Macron’s disappointment, but that he '
            'did not resile from the decision to abandon the French contract '
            'and proceed with the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines in '
            'partnership with the US and UK. He said doing otherwise would '
            'have elevated French disappointment above Australia’s national '
            'interests. Macron expressed scepticism to Australian journalists '
            'that the Aukus nuclear submarines would arrive on schedule. He '
            'noted there was an 18-month review of the feasibility of the '
            'arrangement, and quipped: “Good luck.” Macron has told Morrison '
            'that Australia’s decision was about more than the submarine '
            'contract. In a phone call last week, Macron said it was also a '
            '“unilateral decision” to scale back the French-Australian '
            'strategic partnership and “broke the relationship of trust”. '
            'France has urged Australia to propose “tangible actions” to heal '
            'the diplomatic rift. At Senate estimates last week, the secretary '
            'of the defence department, Greg Moriarty, said there had been “a '
            'number of engagements with French officials about our thinking '
            'about capability requirements” but added: “I did not discuss '
            'cancellation of the Attack programme with any French official '
            'prior to the night before [the announcement].” Asked whether '
            'representatives of France’s Naval Group were blindsided, Moriarty '
            'said: “They were surprised and disappointed – understandably.”',

{'article': 'When it comes to the world of mathematical puzzles, Hungary is a '
            'superpower. Not just because of the Rubik’s cube, the iconic toy '
            'invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974, but also because of its long '
            'history of maths outreach. In 1894, Hungary staged the world’s '
            'first maths competition for teenagers, four decades before one '
            'was held anywhere else. 1894 also saw the launch of KöMaL, a '
            'Hungarian maths journal for secondary school pupils full of '
            'problems and tips on how to solve them. Both the competition and '
            'the journal have been running continuously since then, with only '
            'brief hiatuses during the two world wars. This emphasis on '
            'developing young talent means that Hungarians are always coming '
            'up with puzzles designed to stimulate a love of mathematics. (It '
            'also explains why Hungary arguably produces, per capita, more top '
            'mathematicians than any other country.) I asked Béla Bajnok, a '
            'Hungarian who is now director of American Mathematics '
            'Competitions, a series of competitions involving 300,000 students '
            'in the US, whether he knew of any puzzles that originated in '
            'Hungary. The first thing he said that came to mind was the ‘3-D '
            'logic puzzle’, a type of logic puzzle in which you work out the '
            'solution in a three dimensional box, rather than (as is the case '
            'with the standard version) in a two-dimensional grid. He said he '
            'had never seen this type of puzzle outside Hungary. Below are two '
            'examples he created. You could solve these using an extended two '
            'dimensional grid. It’s more in the spirit of the question, '
            'however, to draw a three-dimensional one, like you are looking at '
            'three sides of a Rubik’s Cube. 1. Date night Andy, Bill, Chris, '
            'and Daniel are out tonight with their dates, Emily, Fran, Gina, '
            'and Huong. We have the following information. 1. Andy will go to '
            'the opera 2. Bill will spend the evening with Emily, 3. Chris '
            'would not want to go out with Gina, 4. Fran will see a movie 5. '
            'Gina will attend a workshop. We also know that one couple will '
            'see an art exhibit. Who will go out with whom, and what will they '
            'do? 2. Condo conundrum When Mr and Mrs Verona opened the door to '
            'their condominium at 11am this morning, they saw a terrible '
            'sight: their beautiful home had been burgled. They called the '
            'police, who came over immediately. The upcoming investigation '
            'revealed the following. 1. There are six condominiums in the '
            'building, numbered 1 to 6, the Veronas owned #4. 2. The Veronas '
            'left their home at 6pm last night. 3. The night guard of the '
            'building, Mr. Safe, works from 6pm till 10am. 4. There were six '
            'visitors in the building during last night: Mr A. Bream, Miss F. '
            'Green, Mr R. Hill, Dr T. Smith, Miss T. Taylor, and Mr Z. White. '
            'They all visited one of the six condominiums, each a different '
            'one, some time between 6pm and midnight. Mr. Safe could not '
            'recall, however, who visited which place; but he was sure that '
            'none of them stayed longer than an hour. Furthermore, they all '
            'stayed during different hours; the first one between 6pm and 7pm, '
            'the second between 7pm and 8pm, and so on. 5. Mr Bream was at a '
            'huge party at the country club. He arrived there at 8pm and '
            'stayed till midnight. 6. Miss Green was also at the country club; '
            'she arrived at 9pm and left with Mr Bream. 7. Mr Hill could not '
            'provide any credible alibi for the night before. 8. Miss Taylor '
            'was at her home watering her front yard between 7.45pm and 9pm. '
            'Several of her neighbors saw her. 9. Mr White was at the party at '
            'the country club. He arrived at 7pm and left at 10pm but, '
            'surprisingly, he came back again at 11pm and stayed till after '
            'midnight. 10. No one could enter the condominium without going '
            'through the lobby where Mr. Safe was stationed. 11. None of Dr. '
            'Smith’s, Miss Taylor’s, or Mr White’s fingerprints were found in '
            'condo #5. 12. Dr Smith could not have visited condos #1, #3, or '
            '#6. 13. Miss Green couldn’t have visited condos #3 and #6. 14. Mr '
            'Safe recalled that shortly before 8pm a visitor left either condo '
            '#1 or #4. 15. Nobody entered condos #5 and #6 before 7pm. 16. A '
            'visitor arrived at 8pm, and entered condo #1, #3, or #6. 17. '
            'Nobody visited condos #2, #3, and #6 between 10pm and 11pm. Well, '
            'these were all the clues that the police investigation revealed '
            'during the first day of the investigation. Can they solve this '
            'terrible crime without further information? I’ll be back at 5pm '
            'UK time with the solutions. PLEASE NO SPOILERS Instead discuss '

{'article': 'In October last year, thousands of mainly young Nigerians took to '
            'the streets to protest against police abuses, particularly among '
            'the now-disbanded brutal special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police '
            'unit. – Yet the several protests across the country were brutally '
            'repressed. At least 12 people were killed in the #EndSars '
            'protests, according to Amnesty International, and dozens were '
            'injured, including at Lekki tollgate in Lagos on 20 October, '
            'where witnesses livestreamed soldiers shooting at protesters '
            'draped in or waving Nigerian flags. The army and Nigerian '
            'government continue to deny anybody was killed at Lekki tollgate, '
            'and atrocities at other demonstrations have scarcely been '
            'acknowledged. A year on, four young Nigerians present at the '
            'protests across Nigeria reflect on the brutality they suffered '
            'and witnessed. They describe how it changed them and how they now '
            'feel about their home country.\n'
            'Amaka Obi*, 30, living in the US I didn’t see any of the '
            'shootings [at Lekki tollgate]. But I saw blood everywhere. It was '
            'unreal. And I heard screams, I heard people crying. And the '
            'gunshots. The only people that had guns were the military. After '
            'it happened, it was something that I tried not to think about, '
            'but the images, I just couldn’t get them out of my head for '
            'months. That night, it started off OK. The military was kind of '
            'surrounding us. They had these machine guns. And they were '
            'shouting at us. But I didn’t feel scared at that point. I thought '
            'there’s no way they’re ever going to do anything, there are '
            'hundreds of people around. It wasn’t bright daylight, but it was '
            'light enough for people to see.\n'
            'But then it got dark and the tollgate lights went out. I wasn’t '
            'at the main entrance of the tollgate, I was a little further '
            'away, but I just heard screaming and running. People were '
            'shouting, “they’re killing, they’re killing”. People were being '
            'pushed over and trampled. I was trying to find my friend because '
            'I didn’t know what was happening and I was afraid. For at least a '
            'few days afterwards, I was in shock. I left Lagos immediately and '
            'went to Abuja, even though Abuja wasn’t safe. During the '
            'protests, my mum was calling me every day begging me to leave, '
            'crying, and I didn’t because I didn’t feel unsafe. But that was '
            'the first time I did. I left Nigeria within a week. And then I '
            'felt this guilt. I was privileged enough that I didn’t have to be '
            'there. I have a blue passport [one of Nigeria’s five types of '
            'passport, given to government officials], I could leave at any '
            'point, but my friends and everyone are still there.\n'
            'For a while, I thought maybe it didn’t happen. But then how can '
            'all of us remember the same thing? It did happen, it’s just they '
            '[the government] denied it. That’s the scary thing about the '
            'government. They can just gaslight you and tell you what happened '
            'isn’t what happened. Then you feel crazy. I know I’ll never go to '
            'another protest in Nigeria, because we can’t protect ourselves. '
            'When I went back to Nigeria, it felt different to previous times. '
            'I love to travel a lot, I used to take a bus from Abuja to Lagos, '
            'but no way now. Ogechi Igbani, 32, from Abuja When the agitation '
            'started and conversations happened online, it gave me energy. I '
            'wanted to do something. That day [11 October], I got to Unity '
            'fountain. There were about 200 or 300 of us. The idea was to '
            'march to the police headquarters. We were singing our songs, and '
            'people were greeting us on the road. When we got to an '
            'intersection with two police armoured trucks, 30 or so people '
            'went towards them and knelt down. The police began firing '
            'teargas. Initially, we were standing our ground, but then '
            'gunshots started. We were running and they [the police] were '
            'chasing us. I thought, “wow, I’m going to die”. But at the same '
            'time, in a weird way, I wasn’t afraid. Some people ran into a '
            'bush to hide. I could have joined them but I thought, “why am I '
            'running? I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t commit any '
            'offence”. So I just stopped.\n'
            'There was a police van with seven to 10 policemen. Immediately '
            'they saw me, stopped and said: “Shebi, you’re one of them?” '
            '[Shebi is Yoruba term used for confirmation of a statement: “is '
            'it not that?” or “you agree?”]. The officers that attacked me had '
            'guns and sticks, which were thick branches cut from trees.\n'
            'The first person slapped me across the face. I fell to the '
            'ground. About four or five of them started hitting me with the '
            'sticks. I tried to cover my head. All I was thinking was, “If I '
            'can’t do anything else, let me prevent them from hitting my '
            'head”. And they asked, “Who sent you? How much were you paid? Do '
            'you think you can protest? Who are you?”. I can’t even tell how '
            'long it lasted. Before then, I had not had encountered police '
            'brutality. But now I was seeing it for myself. And it wasn’t '
            'pretty. It wasn’t nice. It’s not something that I would wish for '
            'anybody. It made me start thinking about how, one day, I’m not '
            'going to be here any more. It made me think of things I would do '
            'or should do to make my society better. For me, it was like a '
            'reawakening. Now, I’m part of a group of young people wanting to '
            'change the country for the better. I still believe in Nigeria and '
            'think while I’m here I want to try to make things better. Isaiah '
            'Ekabo, 32, from Lagos I wanted to join the protests immediately '
            'as they began in Ajangbadi [a suburb of Lagos]. I was excited, '
            'the youths were protesting all over Nigeria, even around the '
            'world, outside embassies and everywhere. It was our time. I was '
            'thinking, “yes, finally. Let’s come together. Let’s tell them '
            'that we’ve had enough”. The government, the police, they know '
            'what they put people through every day, so they can’t tell us '
            'they were surprised. Harassment all the time, because your hair '
            'is one colour, or because of piercings, or dreads. Even without '
            'any of those things, they can stop you for any reason. But, '
            'instead of seeing us as citizens demanding our rights, look what '
            'they did?\n'
            'The first day I joined, straight away, they [the police] were '
            'shooting. They didn’t care at all. I know of two people who were '
            'killed. I was running and heard them shooting from behind me. One '
            'person running some distance in front of me suddenly collapsed. '
            'They shot him. I couldn’t stop to check him, I just ran. Fearing '
            'for my life, I ran into a sidestreet. In Nigeria, in a so-called '
            'democracy, I was running from police who were trying to end my '
            'life, because of protests.\n'
            'I don’t really think about the protests now. I don’t give myself '
            'that opportunity. It’s a painful period because our government '
            'showed itself. But this is not new, it’s what we’ve known it to '
            'be. Just to survive in Nigeria, it’s too much. Everything is '
            'working against you. Be it no light, no roads, few jobs, bad '
            'water. Then, on top of that, we have to beg that the police don’t '
            'harass or kill us. I studied architecture at university. I '
            'finished six years ago. Since then, I’ve been working, doing '
            'different jobs that are OK, it’s just not what I was hoping for. '

            'On 20 October, my friend, Olamide Gudo, and I left the protest at '
            'about noon. But when we got to Obalende [a neighbourhood in Lagos '
            'state], we were not able to get a bus home to Ikorodu. We were '
            'stranded. Some youths had taken over the area. So we thought, '
            'let’s go back to Lekki tollgate, because that place is safer. We '
            'had been at the protest there and the atmosphere was very safe, '
            'like nothing I had ever seen before. People were giving speeches, '
            'singing, dancing, protesting. There was food around and drinks. '
            'At about 6.45pm, we heard that Nigerian soldiers were coming to '
            'the Lekki tollgate.\n'
            'The tollgate lights had never gone off before, but when they '
            'turned them all off and we saw people [in uniform] removing the '
            'cameras, we became scared. What happened was the worst memory '
            'that I can never forget. When they [the army] got to the '
            'tollgate, they immediately started shooting. I was so shocked. '
            'Did this government send soldiers to come and kill innocent '
            'youths? It’s our right to protest peacefully. Some of us sat '
            'down. I saw a military man … He shot me [in the chest].\n'
            'I ran away … but I was gradually getting weaker. There were so '
            'many people running, everywhere was dark. I thought if I carried '
            'on in that direction I was going to lose blood until I died, so I '
            'started to run back. And I heard two men say, “this guy has been '
            'shot”. I fell to the ground. These young men took my picture, '
            'then they took me to the general hospital in Marina. The bullet '
            'had gone through my back. In the ambulance they were saying I had '
            'lost so much blood. The nurse was praying, trying to encourage me '
            'to be courageous, saying that I should not lose hope. This was '
            'around 1am. I was the first person from the tollgate admitted to '
            'the ward. By later that morning, there was no more space. To this '
            'day, Lai Mohammed [Nigeria’s information minister], the army, the '
            'government, are telling us that nobody was killed at the Lekki '
            'tollgate. You can see how disgraceful they are. So what we saw '
            'with our eyes is a lie? Are these bullet wounds fake? I’ve posted '
            'videos on my YouTube channel for future reference. *Name changed',

{'article': 'The problem: rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The level of '
            'CO2 has been rising since the Industrial Revolution and is now at '
            'its highest for about 4m years. The rate of the rise is even more '
            'striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we '
            'are in “uncharted territory”.\n'
            'The causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are '
            'sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas '
            'burning. The slight reduction in 2020 due to coronavirus '
            'lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip” in the continuing '
            'buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World '
            'Meteorological Organization.\n'
            'The causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for '
            'timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon '
            'emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of '
            'wildlife on Earth.\n'
            'The causes (III): farming Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas '
            'and emissions are increasing faster now than at any time in 40 '
            'years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as '
            'fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites are responsible.\n'
            'The consequences: global temperature rise The planet’s average '
            'temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has '
            'rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population '
            'has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the '
            'atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more '
            'intense.\n'
            'The consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably '
            'rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels '
            'are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature '
            'rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will '
            'eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to '
            'Shanghai.\n'
            'The consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the '
            'sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s '
            'heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles '
            'in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic '
            'may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia '
            'and North America.\n'
            'The upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops '
            'have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many '
            'places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also '
            'expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still '
            'required to reach the scale needed, and tackle difficult sectors '
            'such as aviation and farming.\n'
            'The upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric '
            'cars and vans is still small compared with those running on '
            'fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are '
            'cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream.\n'
            'The upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, '
            'depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is '
            'vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other '
            'technologies, such as generating green hydrogen, will also be '

{'article': 'In September 2006, shortly before the annual UN climate talks to '
            'be held that year in Nairobi, Kenya, I looked for hope amid the '
            'predictions of ecological collapse and the total failure of '
            'countries to act on emissions. It was hard going. The best I '
            'could manage was to argue that political, social and '
            'technological awareness of the climate crisis was growing and '
            'starting to translate into action. It was now a race between new '
            'ideas and political realities. A personal revolution was taking '
            'place, I wrote. “See how far we have [all] come in a generation … '
            'Have you thought about installing solar panels or bought '
            'renewable energy? Have you chosen not to take a plane or bought a '
            'less powerful car? Have you voted for a political party or an '
            'individual because of their record on the environment? Have you '
            'tried to recycle more? Have you linked heatwaves and hurricanes '
            'with climate change, or wondered what kind of physical world your '
            'children will inhabit?” Yes, it was thin, but then it seemed '
            'unlikely that an oil-addicted, carbon-illiterate world could, or '
            'even wanted to, ditch fossil fuels. Hopelessness was rife. Net '
            'zero was on few agendas. Renewable wind and solar power barely '
            'registered, and disinformation by denier and free-market '
            'thinktanks had paralysed the debate. Even the most cautious '
            'predictions warned of climate change accelerating fast as '
            'populations and wealth grew, with more extreme and unpredictable '
            'weather, sea level rises, water and food shortages, and effects '
            'on biodiversity.\n'
            'I concluded: “Within most of our lifetimes there will be at least '
            '2 billion more people – another China and a half – all being '
            'encouraged to consume as much oil, water, land, minerals, wood '
            'and stone as we in Britain do today. That will mean something '
            'like 1,000 times as many aeroplanes, 10 times as many cars and '
            'half as much food and water again being needed. Forget it. This '
            'will require several new planets.” Worryingly, few people seemed '
            'to understand the scale of the catastrophe-in-waiting. That year, '
            'the Royal Society in London declared there was scientific '
            'consensus of man-made warming, the 692-page Stern review showed '
            'how it could lead to the greatest recession in history, and the '
            'then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, told world leaders that '
            'those who questioned climate change were “out of step, out of '
            'arguments and out of time”.\n'
            'But the media were barely interested enough to even send '
            'reporters to Nairobi, and it would be many years before the '
            'Murdoch empire, the BBC and even Channel 4 TV stopped giving '
            'equal air time to deniers. Even worse, despite climate being on '
            'the international agenda since 1992, the Kyoto protocol – the '
            'only binding global treaty that stipulated cuts in greenhouse gas '
            'emissions – had been in force for a year and then only obliged a '
            'handful of industrialised countries to cut emissions by 5.2% on '
            '1990 figures. Meanwhile, the world’s two largest emitters – China '
            'and the US – were not even signed up. 2006 was possibly the '
            'lowest point in attempts to get the world to reduce emissions. '
            'More than 6,000 diplomats and NGOs went to Cop12 in Nairobi in '
            '2006 and saw the US, Australia and other countries delay and '
            'undermine progress. A modest last-minute consensus was scrabbled '
            'together to take forward a five-year “plan of action” that '
            'allowed the EU, US and other governments to congratulate '
            'themselves. The British environment secretary, David Miliband, '
            'returned from Africa to tell parliament that “good progress” had '
            'been made. But to anyone outside the Cop bubble, progress had '
            'been negligible and ambition minimal. In truth, the talks were '
            'going at snail’s pace and a few rich countries that had helped '
            'create the climate crisis had once more chosen not to act '
            'decisively, nor provide the technology or the finance for others '
            'to help themselves. In the words of Greta Thunberg in 2021, the '
            'climate talks were just “blah, blah, blah”.\n'
            'And most of those gloomy predictions have already become real. '
            'Since 2006, world population has grown 20%, or by more than 1 '
            'billion people. By 2050, it is expected to reach 9.7 billion, a '
            '50% rise in just one generation. There are 500m more vehicles now '
            'than there were then and air passenger numbers have more than '
            'doubled. Instead of 1.2 billion people being affected by water '
            'shortages in 2005, there are now more than 3 billion. In that '
            'short time, too, CO2 emissions have risen nearly 23%, and the '
            'last decade has been the warmest on record. Meanwhile, many '
            'millions of people have died in natural disasters, there have '
            'been catastrophic fires, droughts, floods and heatwaves, and '
            'nature is in clear decline. How Rio changed the world Climate '
            'talks have been strained to breaking point since 1972 when the UN '
            'Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm first put the '
            'issue on the international agenda. By 1992, when diplomats at the '
            'Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro started negotiating a treaty to '
            'cut emissions, the enmity between rich and poor nations was '
            'running deep. Nearly one in two people in heavily indebted '
            'Africa, Asia and Latin America were living in extreme poverty, '
            'while consumerism in the rich world was rampant. The north wanted '
            'to talk about the global atmosphere and the felling of forests in '
            'Brazil and Indonesia, but the rest of the world demanded they '
            'first talk about development and poverty. There was deep '
            'resentment at the inequalities and those gaps between countries '
            'have never fully closed. By the time the then UK prime minister, '
            'John Major, arrived at the Riocentro convention halls in June '
            '1992, weeks after being unexpectedly elected, any hope that cuts '
            'could be negotiated had been dashed. With the favelas in lockdown '
            'and military helicopters thundering up and down Copacabana and '
            'Ipanema beaches, US negotiators were under orders to water down '
            'previously-agreed positions to reduce greenhouse gases, and '
            'flatly refused to sign a treaty to protect biodiversity.\n'
            'It was the shape of things to come. The US – responsible for one '
            'quarter of the world’s emissions – had decided there should be no '
            'binding targets or timetables for cuts, that only a paltry $75m '
            'should be given to the world’s 4 billion poor to help them adapt, '
            'that action to cut emissions should be delayed for at least eight '
            'years and be voluntary. It got its way. Nevertheless, a weak '
            'climate convention was adopted and hailed by the rich world as a '
            'landmark agreement to save the planet. In truth it was almost '
            'meaningless and effectively ensured no action had to be taken for '
            'a decade. But in one respect Rio did change the world. As tens of '
            'thousands of local Cariocas joined western environmentalists, '
            'indigenous peoples, charities, women’s and faith groups, poverty '
            'campaigners and youth, there was a real sense of an impatient '
            'global grassroots climate movement emerging, demanding action and '
            'giving a voice to nature as never before. Two short speeches – '
            'one political, one emotional – captured the Rio mood. The Cuban '
            'president, Fidel Castro, expressed the anger felt by the south at '
            'the rich countries’ abuse of nature. “An important biological '
            'species – humankind – is at risk of disappearing due to the rapid '
            'and progressive elimination of its natural habitat. It must be '
            'said that consumer societies are chiefly responsible … They have '
            'poisoned the seas and the rivers. They have polluted the air. '
            'They have saturated the atmosphere with gases, altering climatic '
            'conditions with the catastrophic effects we are already beginning '
            'to suffer,” he said to thunderous applause at the opening '
            'session, before ending: “Enough of selfishness. Enough of schemes '
            'of domination. Enough of insensitivity, irresponsibility and '
            'deceit. Tomorrow will be too late to do what we should have done '
            'a long time ago.”\n'
            'The second speech came a few days later, from 1992’s equivalent '
            'of Greta Thunberg. The 12-year-old Severn Suzuki, daughter of one '
            'of Canada’s best-known environmentalists, shamed world leaders, '
            'saying: “I am only a child, yet I know if all the money spent on '
            'war was spent on finding environmental answers ending poverty and '
            'in finding treaties, what a wonderful place this Earth would be.” '
            'A third speech is possibly apocryphal, but has been quoted widely '
            'and has came to define the direction of future climate talks. A '
            'combative George HW Bush, leader of the world’s remaining '
            'superpower, flew to Rio on Air Force One for 24 hours and '
            'declared the US to be the world’s leading environmental nation, '
            'reportedly adding that “the American way of life is not up for '
            'negotiation. Period.” It was a reality check for optimists and '
            'from then on, the US was cast as the leading climate villain, a '
            'role it has played in most talks since. Unspectacular progress … '
            'until Paris In the 29 years since Rio, CO2 emissions have risen '
            'nearly 60% and are still rising, leaving some commentators to '
            'argue that the meetings are a circus, and because so few cuts '
            'have been made negotiations should be ditched in favour of '
            'radically different talks outside the UN process. The opposing '
            'argument is that blame for consistent failure should not be put '
            'on the complex, inclusive UN process, so much as the lack of '
            'political will from big emitters to act. Climate change is a '
            'global issue, so everyone must have a say and consensus via the '
            'UN is the last best hope to progress, it is said.\n'
            'Both arguments have merit. The talks have indeed been marked by '
            'mistrust and rancour but also by extraordinary initiatives and '
            'great gatherings of civil society. All meetings since 2001 have '
            'run overtime, many ending at dawn with last-ditch compromises, '
            'brinkmanship and dramatic rescues from abject failure. Angela '
            'Merkel, the then 38-year-old German environment minister who '
            'chaired the first Conference of the parties (Cop1) in Berlin in '
            '1995, is said to have single-handedly pushed through proposals '
            'for what would become the Kyoto protocol, the cornerstone of all '
            'international action on global warming. Two years later, John '
            'Prescott, the British environment secretary, is credited with '
            'taking charge at Kyoto in Japan and banging heads together to '
            'secure an agreement to bind developed countries to cuts of about '
            '5% by 2012. Disaster loomed on the final night of Cop17 in 2011 '
            'in Durban until, in a moment of genius, the South African '
            'presidency employed a traditional African mediation technique '
            'known as an indaba to bring together opposing people in small '
            'huddles.\n'
            'There have been villains, too. Bernarditas Muller, lead '
            'negotiator for China and the developing countries group, was '
            'widely disliked by western negotiators but admired by developing '
            'nations for her refusal to be bullied into watering down legal '
            'commitments. Al Gore, awarded the Nobel prize in 2007 for his '
            'work on climate, was the lead US negotiator in 1997 who demanded '
            'loopholes to allow rich countries to buy their cuts from poor '
            'countries, so evading the moral responsibility to act themselves. '
            'Saudi Arabia, Canada and Australia have all been accused '
            'regularly of trying to wreck, block or dilute commitments. But '
            'despite the dramas, most Cops since Berlin have only managed to '
            'grind out unspectacular progress. Cop6 in The Hague in 2001 '
            'failed to agree anything significant at all; Cop8 in Delhi may be '
            'remembered merely for agreeing to call for technology transfer; '
            'Cop11 in Canada just extended the life of the Kyoto protocol '
            'beyond 2012; Cop16 called for developing countries to be handed '
            '$100bn a year to adapt. The lowest point may have been in 2009 '
            'when Cop15 in Copenhagen descended into chaos and recrimination '
            'as rich countries were found negotiating secret deals. High '
            'points such as Cop21 in Paris in 2015, when a new treaty was '
            'signed binding all nations to make cuts, are very much the '
            'exception. The cause of a generation And yet. Despite the snail’s '
            'pace and the failures, I am far more optimistic now than in 1992 '
            'or 2006. In the early climate talks, the science was a side issue '
            'for many countries and negotiations were a political '
            'battleground, with groups of like-minded countries playing out '
            'ideological agendas to maintain influence or economic domination. '
            'For years, the US, EU and UK splashed foreign aid to keep former '
            'colonies onside and tried to prevent China from growing its '
            'economy. Equally, China could “buy” the support of countries with '
            'promises to invest in their economies. Now all governments have '
            'plans and self-interest today is redefined as rapid '
            'decarbonisation.\n'
            'In just 15 years, too, there has been a renewable power '
            'revolution, led by solar and wind. Green hydrogen is now roughly '
            'where solar was in 1992, and battery storage technologies and '
            'marine power are developing fast. With China no longer funding '
            'foreign coal plants and electric car sales taking off, the end of '
            'fossil fuels is nearly in sight. It will not be enough to hold '
            'temperatures to a rise of 1.5C-2C, but the revolution has '
            'started. There are other reasons to be optimistic. Every country '
            'has now had a taste of climate change. Social media, too, has '
            'sharpened the world spotlight and leaders will not want to return '
            'from Glasgow empty-handed or be branded as climate laggards or '
            'wreckers. Money issues, so long a stumbling block in the talks, '
            'may now be resolved, too. Since Covid, which has already cost '
            'countries trillions of dollars, the $100bn a year pledged but not '
            'provided by rich countries in 2009 to help vulnerable countries '
            'adapt does not look that much. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for '
            'Net Zero alone has brought together hundreds of the world’s '
            'biggest banks and finance groups. To not find the money now would '
            'only make countries look cruel and self-destructive.\n'
            'Above all, that global hunger for action, which I first saw '
            'expressed in Rio 29 years ago, is now insatiable. The fight for '
            'the climate has become the cause of a generation, joined by '
            'worldwide movements of youth, indigenous peoples, faith and '
            'justice groups, businesses and local governments. Climate now '
            'embraces science, human rights, health, environmental justice, '
            'race, gender and equity. The arguments have been won, the science '
            'is certain, the solutions found, and people want progress. '
            'There’s still far to go, but the future is not set in stone as it '
            'appeared to be in 2006 – the old walls of doubt are crumbling, '
            'the momentum is building and there will be no going back from '

{'article': 'In 1964, Germaine Greer arrived in Cambridge from Australia to '
            'study for a PhD in English Literature. The subject of her thesis '
            'was love and marriage in Shakespeare’s early comedies, but in '
            'truth, Petruchio and co were not her only preoccupations. '
            'Cambridge, with its large population of men in what she described '
            'as “the full flower of their potency”, seemed to Greer to be “an '
            'ideal spot for the dedicated practitioner of the arts of love”. '
            'By her own admission, she was elated at what she saw as “the '
            'vastness” of the opportunity for “proselytising”. But, alas, the '
            'male fleshpots of Cambridge – otherwise known, I assume, as pubs '
            '– turned out to be a disappointment: “For six months after I '
            'arrived, the only sex I experienced directly, apart from '
            'endlessly repeated discussions in which I found it necessary to '
            'explain that there had been improvements upon coitus interruptus '
            'as a contraceptive method … was the sight of three grubby, '
            'scrawny men in their 40s, who derived some satisfaction from '
            'exposing to me their genitals, pallid and bluish in the frosty '
            'air.” If she were to “infiltrate the wilds of Bohemia”, she '
            'realised, she would have to travel to London, where the sexual '
            'menu was altogether more “promising” – and where, having chosen '
            'from it freely, she would eventually publish an article in '
            'Richard Neville’s underground magazine, Oz, called In Bed With '
            'the English.\n'
            'It probably goes without saying that Greer was a swashbuckler; '
            'her bravado, which would endure long after the 60s ended, should '
            'always be taken with a pinch of salt. But still, this story of '
            'corduroy trousers, unyielding even in the face of so much '
            'antipodean determination, illustrates rather neatly the '
            'difference between perceptions of the 60s and reality – a yawning '
            'gap that Peter Doggett makes the most of in Growing Up: Sex in '
            'the Sixties, his fascinating but deeply strange new book about '
            'the decade. As he notes, the montages so beloved of TV '
            'documentary-makers – the fuzzy clips of gyrating hippies with '
            'flowers in their hair – don’t tell even half the story. Decades '
            'are not neat. Just as the 60s would not really get going for most '
            'people until some time in 1975 (at least), the 50s hung about '
            'like a bad smell long after 1960. The so-called revolution walked '
            'hand in hand with something altogether more repressive: a '
            'backwards tug that enabled the old double standards so far as men '
            'and women go not just to survive, but to thrive. In the same year '
            'that Greer found herself explaining birth control to bearded men '
            'in polo necks, the designer Rudi Gernreich unveiled his '
            '“monokini”, a swimsuit that left the breasts uncovered. Bare '
            'breasts were, seemingly, all the rage; in the Daily Mirror, '
            'Marjorie Proops informed her readers that – good news! – Carnegie '
            'Models’ topless crepe dress had already been ordered by more than '
            'one London store. But really, who was ever going to wear such '
            'things? As a reader of Tit-Bits (not as naughty as it sounds) put '
            'it: “I wouldn’t show my figure to anyone – not even my husband.” '
            'Swerving the obvious territory of the Chatterley trial and the '
            'Profumo scandal, Doggett sets out to show that in 60s Britain, '
            'most radical concepts were only notional, the revealing of too '
            'much flesh to the world among them.\n'
            'He doesn’t buy, or not wholeheartedly, the liberation that came, '
            'for women, with the pill, legalised abortion and (yes) tights. '
            'The sexual revolution was, he believes, a smokescreen for a more '
            'problematic and enduring change, one that objectified women’s '
            'bodies like never before, establishing underage girls in '
            'particular as legitimate subjects of adult desire (he traces this '
            'back, in part, to Nabokov’s Lolita, Stanley Kubrick’s film of '
            'which was released in 1962). If “filth” of the kind that Mary '
            'Whitehouse made it her mission to outlaw seems quaint now – an '
            'innocent BBC comedy drama called Swizzlewick, set in a fictional '
            'Midlands town, shrivelled and died when she objected to it – life '
            'for many women in the 60s must still have felt, at moments, '
            'pretty unbearable. Doggett’s speciality in Growing Up is to '
            'provide detailed accounts of court cases involving sexual assault '
            'and murder where the male offender inevitably gets off with '
            'little more than rapped knuckles, though, as he also makes clear, '
            'such attitudes were hardly restricted to stodgy judges and '
            'juries. The liberal intelligentsia was just as bad. In films such '
            'as Alfie, A Kind of Loving and Room at the Top, sex inevitably '
            'spells doom – for women at least. The philosophy espoused by '
            'Emmanuel Petrakis, which had it that men are pre-eminent, and '
            'women there to serve them, was particularly prevalent in the 60s '
            'underground. It has to be said that the reader of Growing Up must '
            'plough through some quite peculiar and gratuitous stuff: on our '
            'behalf, he has (making like Kate Millet, only without the theory) '
            'reread John Updike’s 1968 novel Couples, with its lavish '
            'descriptions of “ivory rods”, and even Leslie Thomas’s ghastly '
            'bestseller, The Virgin Soldiers. But I think, in the end, that '
            'I’m prepared to forgive its author these strange interludes. He '
            'understands, better than many, that half of the human race is '
            'still paying the price for the insurgency that started, and then '
            'stalled, in this period. “If it were possible at this moment for '
            'women to take their masochism and radicalise it, there would be '
            'the bloodiest revolution ever,” said Jane Arden, whose play, '
            'Vagina Rex, was staged in London in 1969. In Growing Up, women’s '
            'suffering can be found on almost every page, the new, guilt-free '
            'lives they’ve read about only ever, for them, a chimera. • '

            'assisted a group of jelly-legged midwives, raising money for '
            'their local hospital. (She told them to breathe, which must have '
            'felt ironic.) Some people are here simply because their loved '
            'ones are fond of edgy presents. “This is my dad’s idea of a joke '
            'for my 30th birthday,” admits Jordan, who is going before me. Is '
            'his dad here for the punchline? “Nah.” Despite having two safety '
            'ropes, when you’re told to lean backwards off a ledge at a height '
            'like this, your brain and (very) nervous system can’t help but '
            'protest. I look down. It’s dizzying. I’m wearing a GoPro, rented '
            'for an additional fee, and trying not to swear. “Keep your feet '
            'on the platform and lower yourself until your feet are above '
            'you,” says Jack. I’m a lobster clinging to the lip of a pot, '
            'upside down. I think about asking Jack what his surname is, or '
            'his favourite colour. Establish a connection. Oh, that’s hostage '
            'negotiation. “You need to step off now,” he shouts. Was it like '
            'this for Neil Armstrong, with Buzz Lightyear over the radio '
            'telling him to step off? Aldrin, not Lightyear. Haha! How do I '
            'stop this happening? I can’t. I step off. As far as mankind goes, '
            'it’s a tiny step. People do this all the time. But for one man, '
            'it’s huge, a moment of absolute trust. I surrender to Jack and '
            'Sian, to the air, to life. They hold me. And my God, the view. '
            'London arrayed before me in all directions. The metal fungi of '
            'the city offices, bursting skyward. A halo of unbuilt space '
            'around St Paul’s. The moss-like preponderance of treetops and '
            'greenery. I forget this city was built on rivers. But even more '
            'than the buildings, it’s the tiny people I see. They flow like '
            'water too, over bridges and through streets, carrying their '
            'individual stories. I see the connected stream, the blood of a '
            'living city. I realise a torrent of them are heading towards me. '
            'To my left, London stadium is filling up, ahead of West Ham’s '
            'game against Spurs. Fans swamp the boulevard. Jump by Van Halen '

            'through my hands, speeding my descent. Tom Petty, Free Fallin’, '
            'would be more apt. A family inside the building gaze out at me, '
            'looking sick on my behalf. But I’m fine. It’s incredible how '
            'quickly one can adjust to this. It would actually be a good seat '
            'to watch the match, I think. As I get closer to Earth, the fans '
            'don’t look like ants any more. They’re gawking at me. “How’s it '
            'hanging?” one yells. There’s no point replying. No one has any '

            'I remember gravity, and the harness, as my feet return to Earth. '
            'My testes hurt, I complain to Fran, in so many words, as I touch '
            'down. “I’ll just switch your GoPro off …” she says. Oh yeah. I’ve '

{'article': 'Throughout the 2021 United Nations climate change conference, the '
            'Guardian will be publishing the stories of the people whose lives '
            'have been upended – sometimes devastated – by the climate '
            'breakdown. Sunil Kandar, Ghoramara Island, India I live in the '
            'Hatkhola locality of Ghoramara. I remember how on this island, '
            'during my childhood, I had a very happy and enjoyable life. We '
            'had a big mud-walled house. We also had large farmland of our own '
            'where rice and other vegetables grew. We sold a big part of our '
            'farm produce in the market. Like some other families in the '
            'island we were pretty rich. The farmland owned by our family was '
            'our biggest strength. Our island is located at the mouth of a '
            'river coming from the north. The northern edge of the island '
            'began sinking bit by bit under the river water when I was a '
            'child. Then, 20 or 25 years ago, the sea began eating away land '
            'around the southern edge of the island where we lived. Ghoramara '
            'began going underwater almost from all sides and the island began '
            'shrinking fast. Farmlands and houses of the people are constantly '
            'going underwater. Cyclones are pounding our island more '
            'frequently in recent years. The fragile island is too feeble to '
            'keep away the tidal waves. Often during natural disasters, tidal '
            'waves cause flooding of the island with salty seawater. Whatever '
            'farmlands are left on the island are turning unusable because of '
            'inundation by seawater and increasing salinity of the soil.\n'
            'Once I owned four acres of farmland. In the past 20 years, '
            'three-quarters of it has been lost under the sea. This year I '
            'have been forced to buy rice for us, for the first time in my '
            'life. I am over 50 now. I cannot go out of the island, learn a '
            'new skill and pick up another job. My son knew he cannot earn a '
            'living on this island. So, he left the island and has become a '
            'migrant day-wage labourer in south India and sends money to '
            'support our family. Within a few years, my son, daughters and '
            'their families will have to move out of this island to save their '
            'lives. But my wife and I are already very old. Somehow we will '
            'spend the remaining few years of our lives on this island. '
            'Oceanographers and other experts came to the island and conducted '
            'studies five years ago. They said the water level around the '
            'island is rising and it will perhaps completely vanish underwater '
            'by 2050. But in the past five years, the island has been '
            'shrinking. I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 '
            'or 15 years.',

{'article': 'I’ve been covering climate and the environment for 17 years – '
            'it’s astonishing to me that so many positive things are happening '
            'in response to the crisis. Of course, we should have been '
            'bringing down emissions much sooner, and lots of the things that '
            'should have happened didn’t. In particular, I’d point to energy '
            'efficiency, which we all thought would be a big win early on, and '
            'fossil fuel subsidies, which have not come down as fast as we '
            'would have hoped. But in general we are seeing positive trends. '
            'Coal, gas and other fossil fuels are mostly on the way out, and '
            'clean energy is rising and rising. Renewables are a key part of '
            'the solution to this crisis. We need to shift away from fossil '
            'fuel energy to clean forms of power, and we need to do so '
            'urgently. Thankfully, their use is growing massively around the '
            'world, and the cost of this renewable energy has come down far '
            'faster than anybody had anticipated: now, in most parts of the '
            'world, wind and solar power are as cheap as – or cheaper than – '
            'building coal-fired power plants, which is fantastic news.\n'
            'It means the cost barrier to renewables that existed in the past '
            'has largely gone away, and we can see the cost of renewable '
            'energy, electric vehicle technology, and battery storage falling '
            'further. These will be hugely important at Cop26. I spoke to Alok '
            'Sharma, the president of the summit, earlier this week, and one '
            'thing he is very anxious about is that Cop addresses the real '
            'economy. The messages cannot just be political and high level '
            'about global action, but how this plays out on the ground with '
            'real people. It’s vital that we don’t see this as an abstract '
            'problem, but that it translates into greener business and '
            'personal decisions.\n'
            'It really is essential that we hold businesses to account because '
            'they are holding the purse strings and they are the ones who make '
            'the world go round. We need to be vigilant against greenwashing, '
            'make sure we hold businesses to account on the targets, and '
            'ensure they are not wasting time with off-setting but making '
            'genuine reductions. The more businesses we have on board, the '
            'more successful the outcome is likely to be. What would success '
            'at Cop26 look like? For me, strong ambitions on emissions cuts, '
            'from all national governments, as well as at state and regional '
            'levels. Banks need to put their money where their mouths are too, '
            'in terms of green investments. There is hopefully going to be a '
            'deal on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and forests – we need '
            'to be planting more trees and restoring degraded land as a '
            'priority. The long-term goal of net zero by mid-century is key, '
            'and we need to see countries putting nationally determined '
            'contributions (NDCs) in place, which are stringent 2030 goals. We '
            'may fall a bit short, but narrowing the gap would still be a '
            'positive outcome. After all, the world doesn’t stop after Cop. '
            'But what we really do need is a plan. In my years reporting on '
            'this issue, I’ve seen so many triumphs and disasters. The bottom '
            'line on our struggle against climate catastrophe is this: we '
            'don’t have a choice but to win, and we absolutely can. There was '
            'a time when it seemed impossible to solve the problem of acid '
            'rain, but we did. It’s true that greater challenges lie ahead, '
            'and they will require action from the whole global economy, but '
            'we have the technology and the ingenuity. I have no time for '
            'people who say this is too expensive – if we don’t have a planet '
            'then we don’t have an economy. So solving these problems is a '
            'question of “how”, not “if”.',

            'who has the rental property and they both live in the wife’s '
            'house). Substituting you for Mr S (in the HMRC example) and your '
            'husband for Mrs S, this is how it reads: “Mr and Mrs A, a married '

            'explanation (but you can always look online if you’re interested) '
            'and move on to HMRC’s conclusion that: “The higher rates will not '
            'apply to the joint purchase by Mr and Mrs A of a new main '
            'residence. As they are married and have both lived in the '
            'property owned by Mr A as their main residence Mrs A will be '
            'treated as replacing their main residence. Mr A only owned one '
            'property at the end of the day of the transaction.” If you hadn’t '
            'lived in your husband’s house as your main residence before he '
            'sold it, you would have to pay the higher rate of SDLT as would '
            'an unmarried couple in the same situation as you (which forms the '
            'basis of the next online HMRC example).',

{'article': 'Five months after narrowly surviving a terrorist bomb attack, the '
            'former president of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed will arrive at '
            'the Cop26 summit with a defiant message: no compromise on 1.5C. '
            'That level of global heating is the most ambitious target on the '
            'table at Glasgow. It will require a global mobilisation of '
            'resources at a scale not seen outside wartime and at least a '
            'halving of fossil fuel emissions and tree burning by the end of '
            'this decade. Many oil exporting nations are reluctant to move '
            'this quickly, but Nasheed says small island states cannot accept '
            'anything less because they are already losing land and people to '
            'rising seas. “I think 1.5C must be asked for again and restated '
            'and never left. Anything above 1.5C and the Maldives will not be '
            'there. We cannot sign a suicide pact,” he told the Guardian.\n'
            'Small island states such as the Maldives are often seen as the '
            'conscience of the Cop process because they are most at risk of '
            'climate chaos and push hardest for deep emissions cuts. But '
            'Nasheed said it would be a mistake for people in other parts of '
            'the world to think they were safer. “This is not a distant '
            'problem for little coloured people in the Indian Ocean, it is all '
            'of our problem,” he said. “The whole thing is framed as if it is '
            'just these tiny, sad islands losing land and people. But no, we '
            'are losing people everywhere. Usually you hear about flood deaths '
            'in Asia. Now we are getting the same news in Europe. If you don’t '
            'listen to us, listen to your own people, who are dying in front '
            'of your eyes.” Nasheed was almost killed in very different '
            'circumstances this year. A bomb attack on his home in May left '
            'him critically injured. He needed 16 hours of surgery and was '
            'then transferred to Germany for further treatment. No '
            'organisation has claimed responsibility, but police have arrested '
            'several Islamic State-linked religious extremists. “I was on the '
            'brink of death. I feel there must be a reason why I survived,” he '
            'said. “One of the outcomes will hopefully be that I can work '
            'harder to advocate in favour of measures against climate change. '
            'I must try to work harder and impress the gravity of issue on '
            'everyone else.” Now serving as the speaker of parliament, Nasheed '
            'said he had been shocked at the latest report from the Maldives '
            'environment committee, which said weather disaster alerts had '
            'increased more than fourfold over the past 20 years and more '
            'people were being swept out to sea due to storm surges and rough '
            'weather. In addition, coastlines are being eroded and more acidic '
            'water is destroying coral reef systems and the fisheries that '
            'depend on them.\n'
            'Nasheed said one entire island had been lost in the Baa Atoll, '
            'which is a Unesco biosphere. “We are losing ground. We are losing '
            'people. We are losing our livelihood. We are losing our culture,” '
            'he said. “This is happening now. It is upon us.” Nasheed is among '
            'the most outspoken climate advocates on Earth. He has often '
            'suffered for his belief in democracy and opposition to '
            'destructive modes of development, which are all the more '
            'remarkable in a politically turbulent nation that has often been '
            'ruled by dictators. He has spent six years in jail where he was '
            'tortured and thrown into solitary confinement for months at a '
            'time. He has been similarly brave and outspoken on global '
            'heating. The veteran climate activist Bill McKibben has described '
            'him as one of only a handful of true world leaders in the fight '
            'to save the planet. Whenever he is not in jail, he said, he has '
            'attended Cop conferences. This has convinced him of the need for '
            'structural reform of the UN’s climate change framework. “We '
            'cannot go on and on talking while the planet is burning or we '
            'will lose credibility as politicians and the UN will lose '
            'credibility as an institution. It should be able to deliver '
            'solutions,” he said. “Now, because of the need for unanimity, we '
            'have a situation where if two countries agree on greater ambition '
            'but a third country says no, then the two countries reduce their '
            'targets to those of third country. We end up with the lowest '
            'common denominator.” Top of his wishlist for Cop is for countries '
            'to align their climate plans with 1.5C. That is a long way off. '
            'Current commitments are putting the world on track for a '
            'calamitous 2.7C, according to the United Nations. Nasheed says he '
            'is frustrated by some leaders, such as the Australian prime '
            'minister, Scott Morrison, who describe 1.5C as a very tall order '
            'because of the possible impact on jobs. “Listening to these '
            'people sometimes sounds like madness. For God’s sake, if you want '
            'to protect jobs and a way of life, then you need climate action.” '
            'He is frustrated by the world’s biggest emitter, China. “They '
            'still think it is their right to poison the planet because '
            'Europeans have done it in the past. This is a mad idea, as if '
            'they are saying ‘the west has brought us to the brink and now we '
            'have arrived to push everyone over the edge’. Two wrongs don’t '
            'make a right, especially now there is new technology as an '
            'alternative to fossil fuels.” But he says a younger group of '
            'civil servants in China appear to hold more progressive views '
            'than the old guard. Nasheed hopes rich nations fulfil their '
            'promise of $100bn a year in climate finance starting from 2020, '
            'but said cash should not be a substitute for emissions-cutting '
            'action.\n'
            '“I hope they don’t say we will give you more money if you accept '
            '2C and we can keep rubbishing the planet. You can build a big '
            'wall and sit back and say isn’t this a beautiful thing.” He said '
            'it would be up to the UK, as the host government, to push for an '
            'ambitious agenda that supports the most vulnerable nations. '
            '“Sometimes the UK seems to think that just because they are the '
            'presidency they can’t take a side. But no, they need to take our '
            'side to start the game. This should be about safety and survival. '
            'I think they should open the Cop by saying that.”\n',

            'time to act. This is a marathon, not a sprint. There is no moment '
            'in time when we go from a world that’s fine to a world that’s a '
            'disaster. But every action, by every person, matters. Every bit '
            'of heating you prevent reduces human and planetary suffering, '
            'because that’s really what this will come down to. The good news '
            'is we have the tools, the knowledge and the technology – it’s '
            'just a question of developing it quickly enough that we make it '
            'accessible and affordable to the mass market. For this, political '
            'will is key, and at Cop26 we need to see a strong expression of '
            'political will. What’s important to note is that political will '
            'can be created, and one of the best ways to create it is via '
            'protest, in which people make their desire for change clear. '
            'What’s also increasing political will, unfortunately, is that the '
            'impact of the crisis is becoming more obvious. Green solutions '
            'are often better than the thing they are replacing – they are '
            'frequently cleaner, quieter, and they will be cheaper when '
            'produced at scale. So they will win out. Anyone who has ever '
            'driven an electric carwill know how fantastic they are to drive. '
            'They are also cheaper to run, maintain, and within a few years '
            'they will be cheaper to buy in the first place. Most models can '
            'now do 200 miles without stopping, which is probably ample for '
            'most journeys.\n'
            'Cellular meat is another good example of an exciting green '
            'solution – it’s grown in vats in factories and is much more '
            'efficient because horns, tails etcetera don’t need to be '
            'produced. People often recoil at the thought of lab-grown meat, '
            'but I wonder if they consider how meat is produced today. If it '
            'can be produced in a clean factory without the use of '

            'us who have experienced (or endured) them know that won’t happen. '
            'There are seven stages to every Cop. This one is unlikely to be '
            'much different. 1 The arrival. Here we go again. Teams of '
            'jet-lagged lobbyists, diplomats, journos, bankers and business '
            'folk queue with delegations of indigenous peoples and youth '
            'groups, lawyers, NGOs and economists to enter the parallel '
            'universe that is a UN climate Cop. Within hours, the complaints '
            'will start about the price of coffee, the distance between '
            'meeting rooms, the Glaswegian accents, the rain, the trains, the '
            'traffic, the UN security, the heavy policing and the dearth of '
            'good restaurants. 2 The beauty contest. Prince Charles will '
            'welcome the world to Glasgow with three minutes of top-drawer '
            'blah blah to be followed by more blah blah by 100-plus leaders '
            'about the future of Earth, the plight of the poor, coral reefs, '
            'forests, and the need for compromise, radical ambition, vision '
            'and hope. Polite applause from some. 3 The great confusion. By '
            'day three, none of the 15,000 delegates or the public will have '
            'any idea what is happening, and those who say they do will be '
            'lying. The negotiations will take place behind closed doors and '
            'involve the obsessive drafting and redrafting of papers that '
            'either do reflect a country’s position or are “non-papers”, which '
            'don’t but might. The talks have their own incomprehensible '
            'language, with Bingos and Mrvs, Namas and Napas, BAs and BRs, '
            'Redds and Lulucfs. No one outside the negotiating rooms is '
            'supposed to understand. 4 The squeeze. The game of diplomatic '
            'poker is on. The dice are loaded against poor countries and by '
            'day four the low-lying states and least developed countries will '
            'be complaining loudly and publicly that the US, UK, EU and others '
            'are not putting up the $100bn (£75bn) a year that they pledged, '
            'and are shifting the goalposts of the Paris agreement by calling '
            'for all countries to adopt the same targets. The diplo-mud will '
            'fly. The sticking points will be over money, targets, scale of '
            'ambition, transfer of technology and timescales. The rich will be '
            'accused of being incompetent and negligent and will respond by '
            'saying, “Yah-boo, we’re all in this together now.” The conference '
            'chair, Alok Sharma, scurrying between groups of countries, will '
            'try to bridge the yawning divides that will have opened between '
            'the carbon haves and have-nots.\n'
            '5 The cavalry. At a certain point, usually near the end of week '
            'one, the many charities and the environment, development, climate '
            'and church groups, along with scientists, activists, indigenous '
            'peoples and celebrities, will stage demonstrations and stunts: '
            'gluing themselves to doors and floors, singing, invading press '
            'conferences and hanging off roofs. Most will be chucked out of '
            'the halls and banned from re-entry by UN guards. It is a '
            'bloodletting, and relieves the tensions. The climate villains '
            'will now be named – usually the US for its bullying tactics, the '
            'Saudis for their defence of fossil fuels, Brazil for cutting down '
            'the Amazon, Australia for its coal and the EU for not offering '
            'enough. Britain, now out of Europe, can be expected to be accused '
            'of doublespeak – pretending to side with the poor but actually '
            'working with the rich. 6 The trick. In week two, the negotiators '
            'hand over the proposals drawn up in week one to incoming '
            'ministers and their teams of political advisers. The '
            'horse-trading now begins. The powerful will have already twisted '
            'arms, offered aid, threatened sanctions and squeezed the pips out '
            'of the poor to make them fall in behind. But equally, China, '
            'India and others will use their diplomatic clout to counter-offer '
            'and raise the stakes. Ministers furiously brief their media '
            'friends. It’s now a high-risk crapshoot. The tension will be '
            'unbearable as negotiations narrow down to a few paragraphs, then '
            'falter, stumble and inevitably nearly collapse. Rumours will fly '
            'that delegations are quitting, or that another draft has been '
            'agreed but rejected. Ministers will furiously brief their media '
            'friends. There will be a long and ghastly night as the corridors '
            'fill with exhausted delegates, the restaurants close, the coffee '
            'runs out and the long wait begins. 7 The sting. Cop should finish '
            'on the Friday night of week two, but – as with Cops in the past – '
            'this one is more likely to go to the wire on Saturday. A final '
            'text will be drawn up and a last plenary meeting will be called. '
            'An “awkward”, or “principled”, group of countries will now '
            'grandstand and call on the world for something better. In the end '
            'it may come down to Sharma calling the US, China and the EU, the '
            'world’s great emitters, into a room for a final haggle at 6.30am. '
            'An agreement, weak or strong, will or will not be struck. Sharma '
            'will summon all the diplomatic muscle he can and then invite all '
            'countries to agree. The world will pray. John Vidal is a former '

{'article': 'A holiday at the Cité des Électriciens in northern France may not '
            'sound like a glamorous getaway, but there are some genuine '
            'surprises to be discovered in the unspoiled region by the Belgian '
            'border, a short drive from Calais or Boulogne. The Louvre has '
            'established a satellite museum in Lens, while the lesser-known '
            'city of Béthune boasts fabulous art deco architecture, artisan '
            'breweries and exciting young chefs reinterpreting local recipes. '
            'The sandy beaches and dunes of the wild Côte d’Opale are never '
            'far away, but what really takes my breath away is discovering a '
            'vineyard halfway up a former slag heap, all that is left of the '
            'region’s coalmines. Fittingly, the vigneron has dubbed his crisp '
            'white wine not chardonnay but charbonnay – a pun on the French '
            'for coal, charbon.\n'
            'The Cité des Électriciens is actually all about miners rather '
            'than electricians. The village was purpose-built in the 1850s for '
            'local pit families – Émile Zola’s novel Germinal would later '
            'expose the conditions that miners were forced to endure. It was '
            'one of several model townships across the French and Belgium coal '
            'belt, built by mining barons. Its name dates from the turn of the '
            'century, when the local post office asked for streets to be '
            'named, for easier delivery of mail – hence Rue Edison and Rue '
            'Marconi, among others. The Cité today resembles a miniature toy '
            'town, with neat rows of houses in red bricks rather than Lego. It '
            'was officially reopened in 2019 after a six-year, €15m '
            'restoration, but then the pandemic intervened and only now is it '
            'finally fully open to visitors. The 43 houses that were once home '
            'to mining families have been transformed into an imaginative base '
            'for discovering the surrounding countryside.\n'
            'A tiny cottage is a comfortable B&B (€60 a night), and a row of '
            'houses has been converted into four roomy self-catering gîtes, '
            'with retro furniture and wallpaper. There’s also space for '
            'artists working on community projects, who organise ateliers and '
            'talks for local schools. And, importantly, 10 houses are reserved '
            'for low-income families. Pride of place goes to two permanent '
            'exhibition halls. One is a modern, purpose-built space '
            'illustrating the long history of mining here up to its '
            'recognition as a Unesco world heritage site in 2012. The other '
            'recreates daily life in the Cité, in five original homes through '
            'oral history recordings, photos and numerous reminders that '
            'behind this utopian experiment, the mine owners were operating '
            'what the French call “controlled liberty”. So while there were '
            'opportunities for education, sport, vegetable gardens and modern '
            'housing, the workers were also encouraged not to drink, and to '
            'start families, so as to provide the next generation of miners. '
            'The mineworks and shafts once dominated the adjoining town of '
            'Bruay-La-Buissière, though most have been demolished since their '
            'closure in 1979. But the surrounding countryside is still marked '
            'by volcano-like slag heaps, rising up to 150 metres, albeit now '
            'covered in thick vegetation. However, the terril outside the '
            'hamlet of Haillicourt looks strangely different from the rest, '
            'with neat lines of steep terraces just below the peak, which turn '
            'out to be one of the world’s strangest vineyards.\n'
            '“It is now eight years since the first harvest on our historical '
            'terril,” says Flavien Desette from Haillicourt’s town hall, “and '
            'our chardonnay, which we have christened ‘charbonnay’, is getting '
            'respected reviews and featuring on the wine lists of restaurants '
            'around France, so now numerous other winemakers are looking at '
            'planting vineyards around here.” So far, production is limited to '
            'about 3,000 bottles, and tours of the vineyard and the tiny '
            'vaulted cellar beneath Haillicourt’s 18th-century priory can be '
            'organised through the town hall. Visit during the harvest and you '
            'will see 50 villagers picking grapes by hand, then hand pressing '
            'them. At certain times of year, the terril literally starts '
            'steaming, thanks to the combustible but fertile mix of schist and '
            'soil. It’s a quite unique terroir.\n'
            'The Cité des Électriciens lies between two very contrasting, '
            'historic northern French cities, Lens and Béthune. Both are near '
            'the great battlefields of the first world war, and had been '
            'largely razed to the ground by the time peace was signed. Béthune '
            'was beautifully rebuilt in art deco style, especially the opulent '
            'town square whose medieval belfry miraculously survived, and is '
            'now part of the Unesco world heritage site. The Grand Place is '
            'the life and soul of the city, lined with bistros, brasseries and '
            'traditional estaminet bars. And just off the main square, a '
            'magnificent mansion is being brought back to life by a creative '
            'young chef, Maxime Leplat and his wife, Noémie. The sumptuous '
            'ground floor with soaring ceiling and crystal chandeliers is '
            'split into a casual bistronomie-style dining room – offering a '
            'three-course set lunch for €29 – and a fine dining section where '
            'Maxime is determined to earn his first Michelin star. Adventurous '
            'foodies signing up for the tasting experience are led straight to '
            'the kitchen and a marble table opposite the imposing bearded '
            'figure of Maxime. While his enthusiastic assistants rush around '
            'prepping dishes, the chef conjures up half a dozen unexpected '
            'appetisers, often paired with local craft beers, that include a '
            'delicate macaron of tomato and shrimps, a molecular take on the '
            'traditional mackerel in mustard sauce, a beef carbonnade in a '
            'marshmallow and a mini croque-monsieur with pungent local '
            'Maroilles cheese topped with pickled herring. The biggest '
            'surprise, though, is the bill at €48 a head. During the long '
            'lockdown, Noémie and Maxime renovated four rooms above the '
            'restaurant into fashionable B&B accommodation (doubles €95).\n'
            'Lens did not fare so well during its postwar reconstruction and '
            'is in a messy mix of styles that for a long time left the city '
            'best known for its fanatical football club. That all changed when '
            'an agreement was made with the Louvre to build its first '
            'satellite museum in France here, which opened in 2012. While the '
            'futuristic architecture of Louvre-Lens is breathtaking, what '
            'really surprises the visitor is the contrast, as a viewing '
            'experience, with the Paris musesum. The immense permanent '
            'collection, of which 20% rotates each year, is in a revolutionary '
            'single open area. I have certainly never seen a museum space like '
            'this: in one room you pass from paintings and sculptures dating '
            'from 3500BC to ones created in 1850. Benoît Diéval of the local '

{'article': 'The G20 is failing poor and vulnerable countries by not agreeing '
            'to a climate plan that would ensure their people’s survival, '
            'leading figures at the Cop26 climate talks have said. Leaders '
            'representing more than a billion of the people most at risk from '
            'the climate crisis told the Guardian they were “extremely '
            'concerned” and had hoped for more from the G20 summit in Rome. '
            'They said the prospect of limiting global heating to 1.5C above '
            'pre-industrial levels, a vital threshold that scientists say is a '
            '“planetary boundary”, was slipping away as the UN conference '
            'opened in Glasgow.\n'
            'Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda and '
            'chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which represents 39 '
            'countries, said: “From what I’ve seen it appears we are going to '
            'overshoot 1.5C. We are very concerned about that. This is a '
            'matter of survival for us.” He blamed the influence of powerful '
            'private-sector interests for the G20’s failure to come up with '
            'better plans, and said developed countries would also suffer the '
            'consequences of climate breakdown. “We are here to save the '
            'planet, not to protect profits. There are very powerful '
            'multinational firms and lobbies … who benefit from fossil fuel '
            'subsidies.” The G20 produced what some analysts said was '
            'significant progress in Rome, with a pledge to reach net zero '
            'emissions by around the middle of century and take action this '
            'decade to limit global heating to 1.5C, but poor countries said '
            'the promises were not accompanied by clear plans. They urged the '
            'G20 leaders arriving in Glasgow for two days of talks with more '
            'than 100 other heads of state, which will be followed by nearly '
            'two weeks of talks among senior officials, to come up with more '
            'ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “I’m extremely '
            'worried, but despite the disappointment I’m still hopeful,” said '
            'Browne. Sonam Wangdi, the chair of the Least Developed Countries '
            'group, which represents more than a billion people globally, '
            'said: “The progress is definitely not enough up to now. We are a '
            'long way from a 1.5C pathway. We need them to ramp up ambition. '
            'We have done our share, and we contributed least to the problem.” '
            'At more than 1.5C of heating, many small islands face inundation '
            'from rising sea levels and fiercer storm surges, but Browne said '
            'developed countries were also at risk. “Many of them have coastal '
            'areas too,” he pointed out. Steve Victor, the environment '
            'minister of Palau, said: “The G20 has lagged far behind where it '
            'must be to secure a safe future for the people of small island '
            'developing states. This is not an abstract concept or political '
            'issue for us. The threat of climate change, to us, can’t be '
            'overstated. We are now living it. The G20 makes up 80% of global '
            'emissions, they are the ones most critical for ensuring we can '
            'stay on a path to a 1.5C future.” He said the G20 should agree to '
            'phase out coal, which it has failed to do, though it did agree to '
            'stop financing new coal development overseas. It should also halt '
            'fossil fuel subsidies, he added. Bruce Billimon, the health '
            'minister of the Marshall Islands, said: “We live in a time in '
            'which the decisions we make will have impactful consequences in '
            'the future and coming generations, on our people’s health, '
            'wellbeing, safety and of course security. “Already, at 1.1C, my '
            'country can feel the climate change effects, and beyond 1.5C, '
            'unquestionably, the people of the Marshall Islands and other '
            'vulnerable nations will be in peril. And the impacts will not '
            'only be felt in states like mine, but also, I believe it will be '
            'a ripple effect, thus in years to come all of the countries of '
            'the G20 as well.” The UK said developing countries would have the '
            'opportunity on Monday to put these concerns to G20 leaders at a '
            'face-to-face meeting in Glasgow. Officials from within the G20 '
            'felt that substantial progress had been made in Rome. “There has '
            'been a shift in the zeitgeist, recognising the need to look at '
            'the science and that we need to accelerate action in this crucial '
            'decade,” said one, adding that more progress could be expected at '
            'Cop26 on countries making moves away from coal, the dirtiest '
            'fossil fuel. The G20 – which includes major fossil fuel producers '
            'such as Russia and Saudi Arabia that have long been hostile to '
            'climate action as well as the world’s biggest emitter, China – '
            'agreed to take action this decade on emissions, though they '
            'stopped short of pledging the 45% emissions cuts that scientists '
            'say are needed by 2030 to stick to the 1.5C limit. Browne, '
            'however, said rich countries should aim to reach net zero by 2040 '
            'and developing countries by 2050. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the '
            'green thinktank E3G, gave a positive assessment: “This is a shift '
            'from what they have previously said. The crucial words are on '
            'this decade. Previously they had only talked about 2050, which is '
            'too far away. “This is an expression of a growing sense of '
            'urgency in the G20, driven by both events and science. This is a '
            'political signal that will add momentum to the cop and help in '
            'reaching agreement at cop. We were not expecting this language.” '
            'Victor, however, said more was needed. “The message is simple. '
            'Show us your higher ambition. This decade is, perhaps, the '
            'decisive decade in history. If we fail to halve emissions by '
            '2030, our chance to stay within the 1.5C limit will be lost, and '
            'with it the safe and secure future that the people of vulnerable '
            'countries deserve.”',

{'article': 'Queensland senator Gerard Rennick will withhold his vote from the '
            'Coalition until the government stops supporting vaccine mandates '
            'and provides immediate assistance to people who have suffered '
            'adverse affects from Covid-19 vaccines. According to the '
            'Therapeutic Goods Administration, the protective benefits of '
            'Covid vaccines “far outweigh the potential risks of vaccination”, '
            'and serious side effects are “very rare”. Rennick has been '
            'highlighting cases of adverse effects over the past fortnight and '
            'he wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Sunday '
            'advising he would withhold his vote in the Senate over the issue. '
            'The Liberal senator is calling for the government to scrap '
            'vaccine mandates and indemnities for the states, and improve the '
            'compensation scheme for adverse events. He also says children '
            'should be excluded from any mandates and that the “tyranny” of '
            'domestic travel restrictions should end.\n'
            '“No person in this country should be forced to lose their job '
            'because they don’t want to take a Covid vaccine,” Rennick says in '
            'the letter. He says a “fit and proper” compensation scheme for '
            'victims of adverse effects is needed, calling for the scrapping '
            'of the $5,000 cost threshold and for payments to begin '
            'immediately. “Many victims have been unable to work and are '
            'facing economic as well as health issues as a result of an '
            'adverse event from the vaccine,” he claims. “Victims should not '
            'have to wait until next year to receive compensation and income '
            'support.” He also suggests that people who have had an adverse '
            'event for a first dose have been unable to refuse a second dose, '
            'calling the scenario “completely inhumane”. In the letter, '
            'Rennick says the federal government is indirectly supporting '
            'vaccine mandates imposed by states and private employers by '
            'providing the indemnity scheme. “If as you say that the '
            'commonwealth doesn’t support mandatory vaccinations, then why are '
            'we paying for and indemnifying vaccines being mandated by the '
            'state?” Rennick has previously urged the government to support a '
            'fresh high court challenge against border closures, and told the '
            'Coalition party room last month he was considering withdrawing '
            'his vote.\n'
            'Parliament is scheduled to sit for one more fortnight this year, '
            'with several pieces of legislation still on the Coalition’s '
            'agenda for this term of government. This includes a bill to '
            'establish a federal integrity commission, a promised religious '
            'discrimination act, new cyber security laws, and controversial '
            'voter ID laws. The Coalition holds 36 of 76 Senate positions and '
            'needs three members of the Senate crossbench to pass legislation. '
            'If the government loses the support of Rennick in the Senate, it '
            'will need four of the five crossbench votes to pass legislation '
            'against opposition from Labor and the Greens. Rennick told '
            'Guardian Australia he would be contacting relevant ministers to '
            'argue his position, and said ending the indemnity scheme for '
            'vaccine mandates was among his “non-negotiable” demands.\n'
            '“I want this resolved, and we have got three weeks to sort this '
            'out,” Rennick said. The TGA says vaccination against Covid is '
            '“the most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from '
            'infection”. “Like all medicines, Covid-19 vaccines may have some '
            'side effects (also known as adverse events). The overwhelming '
            'majority of these side effects are mild and resolve within a few '
            'days.” As of 24 October 2021, about 34.3m Covid vaccine doses had '
            'been given in Australia, with 2.2 adverse events reported per '
            '1,000 doses. There have been nine deaths linked to the '
            'AstraZeneca vaccine. Australia has recorded more than 170,000 '
            'Covid cases with 1,734 deaths, and 1,064 people currently '
            'hospitalised.',

{'article': 'One of the enduring mysteries of the last few decades is how Judy '
            'Sheindlin became the highest-paid woman on American television. '
            'Towards the end of Judge Judy’s 25-year run, Sheindlin was '
            'hauling in $47m a year (her estimated net worth is about $440m). '
            'Since the show only required her to work for 52 days a year, that '
            'meant she earned $900,000 just by showing up. And this was Judge '
            'Judy, for crying out loud. It was a televised small-claims court. '
            'It was, by its very nature, mundane and repetitious.\n'
            'And now it is over. Earlier this year, Sheindlin made the '
            'decision to hang up her gavel. You might not have noticed, since '
            'Judge Judy has been airing in reruns since then, and every '
            'episode is absolutely identical to every other episode. But while '
            'you or I might take this downtime as an opportunity to kick back '
            'and enjoy our mountains of unimaginable wealth, Sheindlin has '
            'not. For she already has a new show on IMDb TV. It’s called Judy '
            'Justice. And if you liked Judge Judy then, oh boy, are your '
            'rock-bottom expectations about to be expertly filled. Judy '
            'Justice – very much the Hollywood Hogan of minor arbitration '
            'shows – has been described as a “flashier” version of Judge Judy, '
            'although only the top percentile of Judge Judy acolytes would be '
            'able to spot any difference. Sheindlin isn’t wearing the lace '
            'collar of old, and her robe is now burgundy instead of black, but '
            'this is by no means a reinvented wheel. The format of the new '
            'show remains exactly the same as the old one: a procession of '
            'dirtbags line up to publicly air their petty disputes, and '
            'Sheindlin interrogates them before making a decision.\n'
            'The show is so identical to Judge Judy, in fact, that the first '
            'episode falls into line without any real explanation. We see a '
            'courtroom. We see two bozos who got drunk and had a fight. And '
            'then we see Sheindlin pull a vaguely unamused face. A narrator '
            'announces “This is Judy Justice” and then we’re off to the races. '
            'And since IMDb TV (and, honestly, who knew that was a thing?) is '
            'ad-supported, we even still get the old pre-commercial “coming '
            'up” buffers to gee up our flagging interest. At first glance, '
            'it’s hard to know who – other than Sheindlin’s accountants – Judy '
            'Justice is for. Indeed, it has been reported that her main '
            'competition here is herself; CBS is aggressively broadcasting a '
            'series of reruns (which have traditionally always got high '
            'ratings) during the first volley of Judy Justice episodes, in the '
            'hope that casual viewers would prefer to watch easily accessible '
            'old episodes rather than seek out a new and hellishly obscure '
            'streaming service. And if your viewing tendencies already default '
            'to streaming, then why would you watch Judy Justice at all? You '
            'have every amazing television programme ever made at your '
            'disposal. Why, given the depth and breadth of the major streaming '
            'services, would anyone choose to watch a daily half-hour lowbrow '
            'courtroom show? Even once you’ve taken Sheindlin’s extraordinary '
            'salary demands into account, this is still a filler show that has '
            'to find a home in a media landscape that no longer requires '
            'filler. Having said that, of course, I have to confess to '
            'enjoying Judy Justice a little. It’s an aggressive throwback to '
            'the bad old days when television was full of exploitative little '
            'shows where grubby fools would line up to broadcast their idiocy '
            'on television, knowing full well that they were likely to come '
            'out of it looking terrible. And, remember, this exists at the '
            'classier end of the spectrum. Yes, the first episode is about a '
            'couple who fought so much that they lost their children. And, '
            'yes, the second episode is about a woman who attacked another '
            'woman with a bottle. And, yes, an upcoming episode is entitled '
            'Backyard Fist Fight. But Sheindlin remains a watchable presence; '
            'still sharp, still wry, still outwardly hating every second of '
            'her time onscreen. She’s a compelling character, even after all '
            'these years, and that’s what will draw people back to the show. '
            'Surely nobody on the face of the Earth is going to watch every '
            'new episode of Judy Justice on a daily basis. But to dip in and '
            'out of now and again, it’s going to be just fine. This is enough, '
            'though. If the Roku Channel happens to be planning a reboot of '
            'The Jerry Springer Show any time soon, it might be time to '
            'rethink things.',

{'article': 'Top story: G20 leaves stiff task for Glasgow Morning everyone. '
            'I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Boris '
            'Johnson will warn today that the world is at “one minute to '
            'midnight” in terms of keeping warming below 1.5C as he prepares '
            'to host the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. With the UN '
            'predicting a catastrophic rise of 2.7C on the current trajectory, '
            'almost 200 national representatives, including US president Joe '
            'Biden and India’s Narendra Modi, will gather in Scotland. But the '
            'summit is at serious risk of failure because countries are still '
            'not promising enough to restrict global temperature rises to '
            'below 1.5C, the prime minister has warned. Little was achieved in '
            'two days of preliminary talks at the G20 meeting in Rome, Johnson '
            'conceded, leaving the chances of success in Glasgow as “six out '
            'of 10”. Only 12 of the G20 countries have pledged to reach net '
            'zero emissions by or around 2050. Several key nations – China and '
            'Saudi Arabia – are only formally pledging to meet that goal by '
            '2060. The commitments being made so far were a “drop in the '
            'rapidly warming ocean”, Johnson added. The UK’s only Green party '
            'MP, Caroline Lucas, says the summit is “our last best chance” to '
            'tackle the climate emergency, but warns that Johnson is “uniquely '

            'Britain’s fossil fuel industry so our economics editor Larry '
            'Elliott has been speaking to business and civic leaders in the '

            'actively planning to change employers in the next few months, a '
            'report has claimed, as part of a “great resignation” prompted by '
            'a high number of vacancies and burnout caused by the pandemic. A '

{'article': 'Omid Masoumali – the Iranian refugee who set himself on fire on '
            'Nauru in protest at his indefinite detention – would almost '
            'certainly have survived if he had been better cared for, or '
            'transferred more quickly to an Australian hospital, a coroner has '
            'found. It took nearly 30 hours to bring Masoumali, suffering '
            'burns to 57% of his body, to Australia, after he doused himself '
            'in petrol and self-immolated in protest at his indefinite '
            'detention, telling those watching: “I cannot take it any more.” '
            'Ineffectively treated and monitored at Nauru’s hospital, which '
            'lacked the equipment or specialist doctors to care for him, he '
            'suffered a heart attack before leaving the island and could not '
            'be revived.\n'
            'His coronial inquest heard from a burns specialist there was a '
            '95% chance he would have survived had he been promptly and '
            'effectively treated, and had access to a tertiary hospital. '
            'Queensland coroner Terry Ryan said Masoumali’s initial injuries '
            'were not life-threatening if properly treated. “If Omid received '
            'appropriate monitoring and ventilation before he was transferred '
            '[to Brisbane] … his chances of survival, while not assured, would '
            'have been greatly increased.” Masoumali’s mother, Elham Arouni '
            'Hesari, said her son “loved Australia, but the way Australia '
            'rejected him and took his life will forever torture me”. “My son '
            'had serious burns and then internal bleeding. Why did they '
            'operate on him in a place that did not have adequate medical '
            'facilities to deal with his burns?” In 2014, the Australian '
            'government was told in a report there were “deficiencies” in '
            'Nauru hospital’s ability to care for critically ill patients, '
            'with no blood bank, or working ventilator, or staff trained to '
            'use it. In February 2016, two months before Masoumali’s death, '
            'the Australian Border Force’s chief medical officer, Dr John '
            'Brayley, alongside other doctors, inspected Nauru’s hospital. A '
            'report from the visit stated there was no intensive care unit, '
            'and the high-dependence unit was “ill-equipped”. The Queensland '
            'coroner said that beyond the substandard medical facilities and '
            'treatment, the indefinite nature of detention within Australia’s '
            'offshore processing regime was damaging to refugees’ mental '
            'health. Masoumali had been held on Nauru for more than 950 days '
            'at the time of his death. “I consider that his actions were those '
            'of someone who had given up hope and felt powerless as a result '
            'of his prolonged placement on Nauru.” Arguing indefinite '
            'detention was inherently harmful, the coroner urged the '
            'government to provide certainty to those it detained, and more '
            'rapidly find settlement solutions for them. “I consider that '
            'there is a need to provide more certainty to refugees to ensure '
            'those who are successful in their asylum applications are '
            'resettled in third countries expeditiously and that refugees are '
            'given some assurance that will be achieved.” Omid Masoumali '
            'arrived in Australia by boat in September 2013, and was sent to '
            'Nauru 10 days later. His claim for protection was formally '
            'recognised in 2014: he had a well-founded fear of persecution in '
            'Iran and Australia was legally obliged to protect him. His death '
            'was one of the most traumatic episodes during a period of '
            'catastrophic mental health for many of those held on Nauru. Acts '
            'of self-harm and suicide attempts were common, and children began '
            'to exhibit signs of the rarely seen “resignation syndrome”. Video '
            'of Masoumali’s self-immolation shows him standing in a clearing, '
            'soaked in liquid, and shouting to the people around him. “This is '
            'how tired we are,” Masoumali reportedly shouted. “This action '
            'will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more.” In '
            'the footage Omid then uses a lighter to set himself on fire. '
            'Onlookers scream, tackling him to the ground, smothering the '
            'flames with sheets and removing his burning and melted clothing. '
            'He is conscious. Later vision shows Masoumali at the hospital '
            'pacing up and down screaming with severe burns apparent to his '
            'arms, legs, chest and back. Distressed friends can be seen and '
            'heard pleading for him to be given assistance. His fiancee, who '
            'can not be named for legal reasons, was held on Nauru with '
            'Masoumali. Now living in Australia, she launched legal action '
            'against the Australian government for negligence. She told the '
            'Guardian in 2017: “I will forever miss Omid. “I will miss how he '
            'made me feel safe and looking forward to a better future. I wish '
            'I could feel that way again.” The coronial inquest into '
            'Masoumali’s death heard from Dr Jason Miller, a Royal Brisbane '
            'and Women’s hospital burns specialist, who testified that, based '
            'on Masoumali’s age and the extent of his burns, his injuries '
            'would have a death rate of 5%-10% under his care. “At the stage '
            'of all my discussions, he was stable,” Miller said. “So, '
            'certainly it appeared the burn was very survivable at that point. '
            'But Miller said that surviving severe burns was “fully dependent '
            'on the care that he received in a timely fashion”. “The only '
            'chance he had was to have more effective care in an earlier '
            'timeframe. Unfortunately, that couldn’t be provided.” Miller said '
            'conditions at the Nauru hospital were “wholly unacceptable from a '
            'clinical point of view”. George Newhouse, principal solicitor '
            'with the National Justice Project said Masoumali’s death was '
            'evidence of the systemic failures of Australia’s offshore '
            'processing regime which, he said, left asylum seekers and '
            'refugees languishing for years in indefinite detention. “The '
            'current system is a failure and is intensifying the cruelty, pain '
            'and anguish being suffered by men, women and children left on '
            'Nauru and in PNG and all those who remain in limbo in Australia.” '
            'Graham Thom, refugee adviser for Amnesty International, said '
            'Masoumali’s death was “totally avoidable”, but was the result of '
            'years of neglect by the Australian government and an “appalling '
            'medical response”. Human rights advocate, and former Socceroo, '
            'Craig Foster, said Masoumali’s death “encapsulates the appalling '
            'harm that successive Australian governments have inflicted on '
            'thousands of refugees over the past eight and a half years”. A '
            'spokesperson for the department of home affairs said the '
            'department was considering the coroner’s findings and '
            'recommendations closely. “The Australian government works closely '
            'with the government of Nauru to ensure transferees have access to '
            'health and mental health services,” the spokesperson said. “The '
            'government of Nauru is responsible for the healthcare of '
            'individuals residing in Nauru under regional processing '
            'arrangements.” Australia has provided $54.9m in medical services '
            'upgrades to Nauru, including a surgical facility at Nauru '
            'hospital. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is '

            'install energy efficiency measures resulted in just 15,182 '
            'households on low incomes improving their property’s insulation, '
            'it has emerged. The £1.5bn scheme was designed to improve 600,000 '
            'properties but, according to data uncovered by the Liberal '
            'Democrats, only a small number of homes benefited from funding '
            'for much-needed improvements.\n'
            'In total 41,300 measures were installed, according to the '
            'figures, with low-income households benefiting from around half '
            'of the jobs. Launched in a blaze of publicity last year, the '
            'scheme offered homeowners in England vouchers worth up to £10,000 '
            'to make their homes more energy efficient or to replace old '
            'boilers. While those in work were offered a maximum of £5,000 a '
            'household to cover two-thirds of the work, those on low incomes '
            'and certain benefits could claim the entire cost, up to £10,000. '
            'However, almost immediately the scheme ran into difficulties with '
            'claimants saying it was impossible to find accredited installers '
            'who were either willing or able to do the work. The scheme was '
            'scrapped in March, and in the same month a select committee of '
            'MPs said it had been “botched [in] implementation” and that the '
            'administration had been “nothing short of disastrous”. According '
            'to the figures seen by the Lib Dems, 15,182 home insulation '
            'measures have been installed for low-income households, including '
            '2,063 loft insulations, 4,752 pitched roof insulations and 5,153 '
            'external solid wall insulations. Low-income households also '
            'installed 2,359 heat pumps and 5,257 solar thermal panels. In '
            'total 41,300 measures were installed, according to the data.\n'
            'While applications made before March are still being processed, '
            'the Lib Dems said the scheme’s withdrawal has left home owners no '
            'meaningful government support for insulation. The government’s '
            'recent announcement on green homes included a proposal that '
            'mortgage lenders be set targets to improve the average energy '
            'performance rating of the properties that they lend on. Wera '
            'Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for climate emergency '
            'and energy, said: “We know home insulation is the easiest way to '
            'cut energy bills. But this scheme was a complete disaster, and '
            'now the government appears to be passing the buck on to mortgage '
            'lenders and homeowners. Serious questions need to be asked about '
            'how such an important programme for the environment and household '
            'bills was allowed to fail like this.”',

{'article': 'Before he leaves his house to walk his dog these days, Rick '
            'Barron’s 12-year-old-daughter reminds him that he needs to keep '
            'an eye out because she worries her dad could be the target of an '
            'attack.\n'
            'Barron, 55, is the director of voting and elections in Fulton '
            'county, which includes Atlanta and is the most populous county in '
            'Georgia. For the last year, he’s been subject to a barrage of '
            'voicemails and emails with threats, including some threatening '
            'violence and death, as Donald Trump and his allies have falsely '
            'claimed the election was stolen. “You will be served lead,” '
            'someone said on a voicemail left for Barron in recent months. '
            'It’s an experience being shared by state and local officials '
            'across the United States. For decades, those officials have '
            'largely been invisible, working out of the public spotlight to '
            'ensure the machinery of elections runs smoothly. But as Trump and '
            'allies target that machinery as part of an effort to insist '
            'something was amiss in 2020, those officials have been thrust '
            'into the national spotlight and subject to vicious harassment. '
            'Nearly one in three election officials feel unsafe in their job, '
            'according to an April survey commissioned by the Brennan Center '
            'for Justice.\n'
            '“It’s been a barrage every day,” Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s secretary '
            'of state, told the Guardian. She said the threats have bombarded '
            'virtually every part of her office, including services that have '
            'nothing to do with elections. Hobbs, a Democrat who is running '
            'for governor, testified last week at a Senate hearing on the '
            'threats, telling lawmakers her family had also been threatened, '
            'with calls coming in to her husband’s employer to fire him. Al '
            'Schmidt, a Republican election official in Philadelphia, told '
            'senators the threats were “domestic terrorism” as he read '
            'messages calling for the murder of him and his family. Barron has '
            'overseen elections in Fulton county since 2013 and has been '
            'working on elections for more than two decades. He said he’s '
            'never experienced the kinds of attacks that he’s seen over the '
            'past year. “I’ve done election observations overseas and you see '
            'how in those emerging democracies, former Soviet countries, how '
            'people are afraid to vote certain ways and so they all vote for '
            'the person. You can see now that possibility on the horizon at '
            'some point,” he said. Barron and other election officials said '
            'that partisan websites as well as elected officials who continue '
            'to spread misleading and false information were facilitating the '
            'harassment. Barron described a spike in threats against him '
            'between Christmas and New Year’s last year after Trump played a '
            'video of Barron to supporters at a Georgia rally. They also said '
            'they’re deeply concerned that so many election officials are '
            'choosing to leave the profession, creating openings for people '
            'with little experience or nefarious motives to get into positions '
            'where they could exercise enormous power over how elections are '
            'run. “There are a lot of people leaving the profession. So I '
            'think you’re gonna end up with more inexperienced people running '
            'these offices. You’re going to see people in these types of jobs '
            'for a shorter period of time because the stress, after a while, '
            'it’s hard to ignore it all the time,” Barron said. “I think part '
            'of the purpose of these threats and this ongoing lie is to get '
            'people to quit their jobs,” said Claire Woodall-Vogg, the '
            'executive director of the Milwaukee election commission, who has '
            'also received a wave of threats since the election. “So that then '
            'you have either elections that aren’t as well run and you get '
            'people in who you can control.” In Milwaukee, another place where '
            'Trump has falsely claimed fraud, Woodall-Vogg linked threats she '
            'has received to misleading stories published in the Gateway '
            'Pundit, a far-right news site that frequently published false '
            'information about elections.\n'
            'Last year, she began getting some angry calls after the site ran '
            'a story inaccurately saying she “lost” a USB drive on election '
            'night. She started receiving death threats this summer after the '
            'site published an email from election night in which she jokingly '
            'responded to an elections consultant about the timing of when '
            'Milwaukee released its election results. “I should have not '
            'responded,” she said. Threats began pouring in over email, saying '
            'things like Woodall-Vogg deserved to go before a firing squad and '
            'calling her “treasonous”. She received a letter at home and '
            'threats to her personal Gmail account. Woodall-Vogg wasn’t '
            'persuaded the callers would actually act on the threat, but went '
            'out of state for 10 days last summer as a precaution. She also '
            'got an alarm system and a Ring doorbell for extra security at '
            'home. At work, the office layout is being reconfigured to adjust '
            'the point at which someone coming in first interacts with a staff '
            'member. Workers are also installing security glass that is harder '
            'to break, Woodall-Vogg said. “I always liked that my job was '
            'non-partisan. I really don’t like politics,” said Woodall-Vogg. '
            '“I feel like in the past year, the threats are a direct result of '
            'the same political rhetoric that’s made my job as partisan and as '
            'contentious as it is. It’s all resulting from this facade of '
            'election fraud, that the election was rigged.” As election '
            'officials face threats across the country, Republican lawmakers '
            'have inserted provisions into several new laws that impose steep '
            'penalties for officials who run afoul of election rules. In Iowa, '
            'a new Republican-backed law authorizes a fine of up to $10,000 on '
            'officials who commit “technical infraction”. A new Texas law '
            'similarly authorizes criminal punishment and $1,000 fines on '
            'election officials who fail to follow rules. Law enforcement '
            'across the country has struggled to respond to the threats '
            'against election officials, a Reuters investigation from '
            'September found. The investigation identified 102 threats of '
            'violence or death against election officials in key battleground '
            'states, but could only document four instances in which someone '
            'had been charged, though it’s possible there may have been more '
            'arrests. The justice department launched a taskforce to address '
            'threats against election workers in July. In August, the official '
            'in charge of the taskforce told secretaries of state that “the '
            'response has been inadequate,” according to Reuters. Federal '
            'officials lacked the infrastructure to constantly monitor threats '
            'against election officials nationwide and relied on those who '
            'were aware of them to report them. “A lot of these law '
            'enforcement agencies are relying on us to report. And it’s hard '
            'for us to know what we should be reporting, because we’re not '
            'trained in threat assessment and it’s hard for us to know and to '
            'have the time to sort through,” Hobbs said. “There’s always the '
            'possibility that we’re missing something.”',

{'article': 'When things look especially bleak for humankind, it’s worth '
            'reminding ourselves who we are – what makes us such a special '
            'species. Beyond our machines and our buildings, beyond our fiery '
            'conquests, beyond all of it, we’re exceptional creatures because '
            'we are capable of love. And not just one to one and within our '
            'families, but on a massive scale. This is especially pertinent as '
            'we face the climate crisis. It’s easy to get caught up in the '
            'excitement of our technological transition, which dominates the '
            'climate adaptation narrative. We are the technological ape, and '
            'our technologies will be vital in solving this crisis: windmills '
            'to decarbonise our energy systems, flood defences against rising '
            'seas, and air conditioners to survive brutal heatwaves. We will '
            'need many more technological fixes, and much faster. Just as '
            'essential to our survival, however, are social fixes. Love is '
            'often seen as a charming but irrelevant characteristic in our '
            'species’ story – an evolutionary quirk, relegated to a footnote '
            'for poets and playwrights to ponder. But love is what draws us '
            'together to forge the strong, caring societies that make us so '
            'successful as a species. And it is what will, ultimately, save us '
            'from this crisis. For citizens of rich countries, the climate '
            'crisis is primarily a social crisis – and we have not begun the '
            'social adaptation required. Indeed, we’re not even discussing the '
            'extent of the problem. We face a catastrophic failure of our '
            'social systems to protect the most vulnerable people from the '
            'devastating impacts. The biggest issue will be poverty, and the '
            'solution is not technological but social. Take food. Climate '
            'change will hit crops around the world – heatwaves, droughts and '
            'extreme storms will cause harvests to be lost regularly, '
            'potentially slashing crop production by a third by 2050. We’re '
            'already experiencing problems. Canada’s pea production is down by '
            'about half, and wheat harvests reduced by more than a third '
            'compared with last year’s, for instance, because of extreme '
            'weather. This means food prices will go up around the globe. '
            'Wheat failures will make a range of products more expensive in UK '
            'shops – pasta prices are expected to rise by about 50% in the '
            'next month. Rice and other cereals, fruit, vegetables, oils, '
            'cotton and coffee will all be similarly affected over the coming '
            'decade. Heat and drought also make crops less nutritious, so '
            'families will struggle to afford their weekly shop and get less '
            'benefit from what they do buy. The climate crisis demands '
            'resilient food systems. Logistically, this means large-scale '
            'storage and adapting to new food sources, including insect '
            'proteins and algae. Just as importantly, it means strengthening '
            'social systems so that everyone has access to nutritional foods, '
            'whatever their circumstances. We can’t lurch from crisis to '
            'crisis hoping the charitable sector will provide. When food '
            'prices rise – as they will – food banks will receive fewer '
            'donations at a time when demand is greatest. Food poverty is '
            'already shockingly prevalent, and disproportionately affects '
            'people with disabilities and minority groups. The past year in '
            'Britain has seen a vast rise in the use of food banks. Unless we '
            'manage deep societal adaptation to climate breakdown, the coming '
            'crisis will make hunger worse. That takes planning for adequate '
            'welfare systems for a hotter world with less reliable '
            'agriculture. There is no shame in being poor or hungry; the shame '
            'lies with a government that allows people to struggle with basic '
            'needs while others accumulate obscene wealth. Inequality is a '
            'killer. We’ve seen this through the Covid pandemic; we will see '
            'it to an even greater extent as the climate crisis deepens. '
            'Climate change is a threat-multiplier. Londoners may not die '
            'directly from storm surges that wash away their homes, or '
            'stronger cyclones, as people in equatorial regions will. But they '
            'may well die from a social system that cannot adapt to '
            'accommodate regular flood damage, higher food prices and '
            'incapacitating heatwaves, and people are already weakened by poor '
            'healthcare and underfunded services. Today, a lack of regulation '
            'means we’re continuing to build poor housing stock without '
            'adequate insulation and buildings unable to generate their own '
            'energy through heat pumps or solar installations, which are '
            'highly vulnerable to extreme weather. This means that the poorest '
            'families risk being stuck in uninsurable, unsaleable houses. As '
            'flood-prone areas depopulate and businesses move away, the '
            'poorest people will be left behind – needing to travel further '
            'for schools, for work and for every other amenity. Safer places '
            'outside flooding zones will experience climate gentrification, in '
            'which richer people move in and push up the property prices, or '
            'pay huge sums to shore up their properties. When people in the '
            'hardest-hit tropical regions of the world are forced to flee '
            'their climate crisis – and not in their hundreds but in their '
            'hundreds of thousands – that will become our climate crisis too. '
            'We need to plan today for the influx of large numbers of '
            'traumatised people, with preparations for adequate housing and '
            'healthcare, so they do not overwhelm our ability to take them in. '
            'Managed well, climate migration could help revive depopulated '
            'towns and boost our economies. Done poorly, it could end up '
            'swelling the population of desperate and homeless people on our '
            'streets. A resilient society is one in which people have their '
            'basic needs met, including universal access to healthcare, '
            'shelter and nutrition, so they can cope with the climate '
            'challenges we know are coming. We must create societies that are '
            'confident and flourishing so they are not threatened by disaster '
            'and migration, but are resilient and welcoming. That means '
            'ensuring people don’t feel disenfranchised, but included.\n'
            'Love is itself an evolved human survival adaptation. We see '
            'evidence of compassion in our ancestors, dating back hundreds of '
            'thousands of years, including in their care for disabled people. '
            'Love and empathy are what enable us to cooperate with complete '
            'strangers and create the social networks on which we all depend. '
            'These intergenerational systems, through which we also transmit '
            'our technological knowledge, are the scaffolding around which we '
            'weave our system of care and support for each other. The solution '
            'to our climate crisis lies in deploying this power. Dealing with '
            'the challenges of the climate emergency requires a strong '
            'society. None of us could survive alone. Social resilience '
            'involves creating stronger communities that care for one another '
            'in times of disaster. The acute crisis of the Covid pandemic '
            'showed us how communities could band together to protect the '
            'vulnerable. But this is no substitute for responsible governance. '
            'We must love ourselves enough to demand more of our leaders. This '
            'climate challenge demands a strong, responsive societal '
            'adaptation, which needs leadership and vision to build. As '
            'humanity faces its biggest challenge, we need to adapt our '

            'city of stranded assets. The Granite city became Scotland’s boom '
            'town almost by accident. It was Dundee down the coast that was '
            'originally identified as a probable hub for offshore production '
            'when exploratory work established large reserves of oil and gas '
            'under the continental shelf. Aberdeen has never looked back. '
            'Kirsty Blackman, the MP for Aberdeen North and the Scottish '
            'National party’s Westminster spokesperson on the economy, says '
            'there are more cars with personalised number plates on the city’s '
            'streets than anywhere else in the UK bar central London. Aberdeen '
            'is the one city where taxi drivers can quote the spot price for a '
            'barrel of crude oil. “Everybody knows people who go offshore,” '
            'Blackman says.\n'
            'Yet the UK government’s decision to target net carbon zero '
            'emissions by 2050, a deadline the Scottish government has '
            'advanced by five years, has forced a change of direction. As '
            'delegates descend on Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit, '
            'Aberdeen is looking to a future without fossil fuels. Sir Ian '
            'Wood, who became one of the country’s wealthiest men through the '
            'oil and gas activities of his Wood Group, notes that crude '
            'production is barely one-third of the 4.5m barrels a day (B/D) at '
            'its peak, and will be down to just 400,000 B/D by 2050. He says '
            'the Wood Group is already diversifying out of oil and gas, which '
            'now account for just 25% of its activities. “The aim is to turn '
            'Aberdeen from the oil and gas region of Europe to the all-energy '
            'region of Europe,” he says. Wood wants the city and the wider '
            'Grampian region to diversify into renewable energy life sciences, '
            'food and drink, the digital economy and tourism. A proposed '
            'energy transition zone – sited next to the city’s new south '
            'harbour development – is expected to create 2,500 green sector '
            'jobs by 2030 in high-skills areas such as hydrogen manufacturing '
            'and refuelling facilities.\n'
            'Some say it has taken a long time for the penny to drop in '
            'Aberdeen. “They should have been thinking about this ages ago,” '
            'says Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities '
            'thinktank. “I never got the impression they were fully committed '
            'or serious about it.” But Carter says Aberdeen is better placed '
            'to weather structural change to its local economy than other '
            'cities. “Our data shows a pretty dynamic economy. Business '
            'startups are good. There is a fair-size stock of activities going '
            'on and more than 50% of people have a degree or higher. It is '
            'better placed than some one-industry towns, such as Sunderland '
            'were Nissan to leave.”\n'
            'Fraser Milne is the engineering and products director of the '
            'Balmoral Group, which was set up in 1980 when the oil boom was at '
            'its height. He says the company is now pivoting its subsea '
            'products business towards the renewables sector. At the moment 7% '
            'of Balmoral’s £100m turnover is from the offshore wind sector, '
            'but Milne says: “We expect growth to be 30% in the next three '
            'years – possibly higher.” Oil and gas account for at least '
            'one-third of the local economy once all the knock-on activities '
            'are taken into account. There was a time “when every time the oil '
            'price went up the cowboy hats went back on again”, says Russell '
            'Borthwick, the chief executive of the Aberdeen and Grampian '
            'chamber of commerce. The aim now is not just be a net zero city '
            'but to help other cities achieve net zero as well, he says. Ever '
            'since the first barrel of crude was brought ashore in 1975, oil '
            'has been a political issue, with a long-running dispute over '
            'whether the proceeds should go to Scotland or the UK. The '
            'argument now is over whether the 10bn-20bn barrels of crude that '
            'could be pumped should be left in the ground.\n'
            'The Scottish Green party, which is in coalition with the SNP at '
            'Holyrood, wants the transition away from fossil fuels '
            'accelerated, with no further licences for North Sea oil '
            'production. The Greens say two-thirds of Scots back their plan to '
            'start winding down extraction, adding that the way ahead is to '
            'provide alternative futures for communities that rely on fossil '
            'fuels and not leave them “waiting until we’ve extracted every '
            'last bit of oil”.\n'
            'The oil industry says the transition cannot be rushed without '
            'causing damage to jobs and increasing dependency on imported '
            'fossil fuels. Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of the trade '
            'body Oil & Gas UK, says steps are being taken to decarbonise the '
            'supply of oil and gas from the North Sea through carbon capture '
            'and storage, and hydrogen as a power source. “I don’t want to see '
            'us stop overnight because we have been there with the mining '
            'industry. We want it to be a glide path,” she says. The Unite '
            'union has 9,000 members working offshore, and its regional '
            'organiser John Boland worries that few of them will find jobs '
            'servicing giant wind turbines. “We find ourselves in uneasy '
            'agreement with the industry,” he says. “There has to be a '
            'transition but it has to be smooth and there have to be jobs at '
            'the end of it. There’s a lot of talk about it but I am tempted to '
            'ask: what are the green jobs?”\n'
            'Where there is agreement is that investment in renewables needs '
            'to accelerated and transition needs to be planned. Phil Kirk, the '
            'chief executive Europe for Harbour Energy, the largest UK-listed '
            'independent oil and gas company, says the government must '
            'encourage the next generation of North Sea development – '
            'everything from hydrocarbon production and carbon capture and '
            'storage to floating wind turbines and green and blue hydrogen. '
            '“It is, I expect, a huge political regret that we missed out on a '
            'manufacturing windfall from wind. We have massively invested in '
            'wind but we don’t make a lot of the kit here,” Kirk says. '
            '“Transition won’t happen overnight unless we want to turn off the '
            'lights and shut down our industry and the hospitals. We are going '
            'to have plan carefully and understand the consequences of any '
            'hasty decisions – for the UK and not just for Aberdeen.”',

{'article': 'How will this age be remembered? After the stone age, the bronze '
            'age, the steam age and the information age, what material or '
            'innovation will most define the current era? According to a new '
            'exhibition at the Design Museum, the most ubiquitous hallmark of '
            'the Anthropocene is not a gamechanging material, nor the mastery '
            'of technology. It’s trash. “We are arguably living in the waste '
            'age,” says Justin McGuirk, the London museum’s chief curator, who '
            'has spent the last three years rifling through rubbish with '
            'co-curator Gemma Curtin to put together this timely show. “The '
            'production of waste is absolutely central to our way of life, a '
            'fundamental part of how the global economy operates. We wanted to '
            'show how design is deeply complicit in the waste problem – and '
            'also best placed to address it.” Opening on the eve of the Cop26 '
            'climate summit, Waste Age is a powerful wake-up call, not so much '
            'to consumers, but to the manufacturers, retailers and, most '
            'crucially, government regulators. It is not intended to be a slap '
            'around the face for buying that takeaway coffee on your way to '
            'the museum, or forgetting your cotton tote bag yet again, but an '
            'eye-opening look at the sheer scale of the issue, and the people '
            'working on ingenious solutions. The exhibition begins with a '
            'useful reminder that we didn’t get here by accident. Humans are '
            'not inherently wasteful creatures. Throwaway culture was '
            'something we had to learn – indeed, it was a lifestyle choice, '
            'marketed from the mid-20th century onwards as a decadent release, '
            'following the austerity of wartime. It was the intentional '
            'opposite of “make do and mend”. One advert from the 1960s extolls '
            'the wonders of the new-fangled polystyrene cup: “New and very in! '
            'The party ‘glass’ you just enjoy … and throw away.” It hangs next '
            'to a plastic carrier bag from the 1980s, printed with '
            'descriptions of its many advantages over paper. Little did we '
            'know that, four decades later, the world would be consuming more '
            'than a million plastic bags a minute.\n'
            'Generating waste, the curators argue, has long been a primary '
            'engine of the economy. The history of the lightbulb is an '
            'illuminating case in point. In the 1920s, bulbs were so '
            'long-lasting that they were deemed commercially unviable. General '
            'Electric, Philips and others formed the Phoebus cartel in 1924 to '
            'standardise the life expectancy of lightbulbs at 1,000 hours – '
            'down from the previous 2,500 hours. And so the culture of planned '
            'obsolescence was born. Almost a century later, similar practices '
            'continue: last year Apple agreed to pay up to $500m, after it was '
            'accused of deliberately slowing down older phone models to '
            'encourage consumers to buy the latest handsets.\n'
            'A striking installation by Ibrahim Mahama brings home the reality '
            'of where such defunct electronics end up. He has erected a giant '
            'wall of old TV monitors that play clips from Agbogbloshie in '
            'Ghana, for many years the world’s largest e-waste dump, where '
            'informal workers burn electrical cables to harvest the copper '
            'wire and other precious metals. Mahama has commissioned them to '
            'cast the salvaged metal in the form of TV screen surrounds, which '
            'frame footage showing this toxic process. The scenes are '
            'desperate, but the message is clear: waste is precious. About 7% '
            'of the world’s gold supplies are trapped inside existing '
            'electronic devices, meaning that, according to some estimates, by '
            '2080 the largest metal reserves will not be underground but in '
            'circulation as existing products. What’s more, one tonne of '
            'extracted gold ore yields 3g of gold, whereas recycling one tonne '
            'of mobile phones yields 300g. So waste dumps and landfill sites '
            'are the new resource-rich mines. “In many ways ‘waste’ is a '
            'category error,” says McGuirk. “It’s often perfectly good '
            'material that’s simply undervalued.” The exhibition includes '
            'designers who are already working on what a future of '
            '“above-ground mining” might look like, exploring how objects and '
            'buildings can be dismantled and their parts reused. There is the '
            'work of pioneering Belgian group Rotor, a team of architects who '
            'set up a demolition company to carefully remove materials and '
            'components from buildings slated for the wrecking ball.\n'
            'Their Brussels warehouse brims with everything from marble slabs '
            'to vintage lamps, the spoils of what they call “forestry in the '
            'city”. It is shown alongside the refurbishment projects of French '
            'architects Lacaton & Vassal, for whom demolition is “a waste of '
            'energy, a waste of material, a waste of history [and] an act of '
            'violence”. At a time when global construction waste is set to '
            'double to 2.2bn tonnes a year by 2025, their joint calls to '
            're-use what we already have couldn’t be more urgent. In the '
            'consumer goods sphere, the re-use cause is championed by the '
            'likes of iFixit, an online global repair platform that publishes '
            'free repair guides and sells spare parts and tools, like a '
            'screwdriver to disassemble the iPhone. It has been lobbying '
            'governments for repairability legislation since 2003, with some '
            'success. France is the first country in Europe to implement a '
            'Repairability Index, adopted in January, which requires '
            'manufacturers to provide clear information on the repairability '
            'of smartphones, laptops, washing machines, televisions and '
            'lawnmowers, and award their products scores out of 10. The iPhone '
            '11 may include some recycled rare earth elements, but it got a '
            'repairability score of 4.5 out of 10.\n'
            'The final section of the exhibition moves beyond fixing and '
            'recycling to imagine a “post-waste” world, where materials are '
            'grown rather than extracted. Design exhibition regulars might be '
            'familiar with the wonders of hempcrete or mycelium insulation, '
            'but this show includes a dazzling range of innovations, from '
            'water-soluble electronic circuit boards made of natural fibres, '
            'to “sea stone”, a concrete-like material made from crushed '
            'seashells. Also featured are Sony’s packaging made from bamboo '
            'and sugarcane (embossed rather than printed, to save ink waste), '
            'Notpla’s seaweed-based sachets for liquids and condiments, a '
            'polystyrene substitute made from sunflowers, and a new kind of '
            'leather made from coconut water – alongside things made from '
            'algae, corn husks and organic pulps of all kinds. Such '
            'biodegradable solutions come with their own pitfalls: how many '
            'times have you thrown a plastic container in the recycling bin, '
            'before realising it was actually compostable Vegware? And should '
            'it go in the compost bin or landfill? Behaviour and expectations '
            'will have to adjust to meet the brave new bio-future. “Our '
            'aesthetic sensibilities may have to adapt,” McGuirk writes in the '
            'exhibition catalogue. “After nearly a century of appreciating the '
            'hard-smooth-shiny perfection of plastics, we may begin to embrace '
            'irregularity, imperfection, decay and decomposition.” Your future '
            'organo-laptop might not overheat, slow down, or need its battery '
            'constantly replaced. But it might start to go mouldy instead. '

{'article': 'Sometimes one kind of pain can bring to light another. Stuck in '
            'hospital for a month, Petra Wenham resolved to confront an unease '
            'she had carried throughout her whole life. She was 68 and had '
            'lost 30kg as a result of severe colitis. “My family were very '
            'worried. I was evaluating my life.” Between morphine injections, '
            'Wenham, a retired cybersecurity consultant, had time to wander '
            'online, where she found a blog whose author had decided to '
            'transition after treading on a shard of glass. Something about '
            'the way the pain, vulnerability and sense of mortality galvanised '
            'the blogger spoke to Wenham.\n'
            '“I realised that your past … you look at it and realise all of '
            'the pain. You’ve had all this pain and you really need to do '
            'something about it and at least get a bit more out of life,” she '
            'says. In 2015, Wenham was discharged to await bowel surgery. “I '
            'came out and my first thing to do was to sit down with my wife, '
            'Loraine. She knew that I did cross-dressing from before we were '
            'married. At the time we put it down to transvestite traits. We '
            'had no other knowledge. That odd bit of cross-dressing brings '
            'sufficient mental relief that you can carry on. But in the end it '
            'doesn’t. You have to do something about it. I said to Loraine, '
            '‘Look, I believe I’m transgender. This is what it means.’” Wenham '
            'believes Loraine probably understood the truth before Wenham '
            'herself did. This year they celebrated their 48th wedding '
            'anniversary, having married six months after their first date (a '
            'dinner at the Institution of Electrical Engineers). Wenham was '
            'only a little nervous proposing. “We were soulmates.” And now? '
            '“The personality of the person doesn’t change,” Wenham says. “I '
            'subscribe to the view that all of us love and love knows no '
            'gender or sex.”\n'
            'Together they joined a local support group. By the time Wenham '
            'referred herself to the London transgender clinic in October '
            '2017, she was already living as a woman, though not fully out to '
            'all family and friends. Her children – two sons in their 40s – '
            'and grandchildren, still call her Dad and Grandad. “There is no '
            'point in confusing the kids. It might confuse the world, but '
            'that’s fine,” Wenham says. As a child, Wenham was shy. “You '
            'become a loner. As you go through school the society norm for '
            'gender starts kicking in and the girls start moving away from you '
            'because you are seen as a boy. Nevertheless, you are not part of '
            'the boy set.” Now Wenham has found her voice. In July, she was '
            'the first transgender woman to grace the cover of WI Life, the '
            'Women’s Institute magazine (as a member of the Cake and '
            'Revolution group in Suffolk). She has delivered many talks to '
            'other WI groups and local organisations, including NHS trusts, on '
            'her experience as a trans woman, and joined Pride marches. “I '
            'don’t particularly feel like an activist, although I’ve sort of '
            'fallen into that role,” she says. “What I’m doing is trying to '
            'educate. I want to help people to get a better understanding of '
            'the transgender condition.” Does she ever regret how long it took '
            'her to transition? “If the internet had been there when I was in '
            'my late teens, early 20s, would I have done it? The chances are '
            'yes, I probably would. But then again, I would have missed out on '
            'Loraine, the family, the grandchildren. It’s a difficult call.” '
            'Wenham never did need that bowel surgery. After she took '
            'probiotics, the colitis began to vanish. She and Loraine believe '
            'she was suffering from stress caused by decades of unacknowledged '
            'pain. “Because they never found a cause for my colitis. They were '
            'looking for some sort of infection. There wasn’t one.” Now, more '
            'than ever, she says, “I’m very, very comfortable in my skin.”',

{'article': 'If Caroline Lucas has always seemed an optimistic sort of '
            'politician, that outlook is being pushed to breaking point. '
            'Sitting through the budget last week was, says Lucas, “an '
            'unbelievable experience. It was like being in some weird parallel '
            'universe where there wasn’t a climate emergency, and we weren’t '
            'about to host the world’s nations at this big climate summit.” It '
            'should have been a moment when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, “was '
            'turbocharging the funding for the net zero programme”, says the '
            'Green party MP, ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, '
            'which opened on Sunday. “It should have been the point where he '
            'reversed that unforgivable cut in aid, where we demonstrated some '
            'strong climate policies. Instead, the headlines were about '
            'cutting the cost of short-haul flights.” Her voice rises. “It’s '
            'almost as if he was thinking: ‘What can I do to send the worst '
            'signal ahead of this Cop?’ If I were Alok Sharma [the president '
            'of Cop26 and Conservative MP], I would be extremely angry because '
            'it feels as if he is being undermined by his own government.” She '
            'pauses, and gives a brittle laugh. “So objectively, it’s quite '
            'hard, looking at the evidence, to feel optimistic.” I had asked '
            'if Lucas felt positive about the summit, and she had given a long '
            'list of reasons why she didn’t – including the government’s slack '
            'approach to diplomacy, as host. She says Covid-19 has made it '
            'harder, but our efforts to get countries such as China on board '
            'still pale compared to what French politicians were doing ahead '
            'of the 2015 Paris conference. “We know that if you add up all of '
            'the different so-called nationally determined contributions – the '
            'individual countries’ assessment of how much they are going to '
            'cut their emissions by – that ought to be a minimum 45% cut by '
            '2030. And if you add up what we’ve got so far, it’s leading to a '
            '16% increase. “So on the emissions reductions, we’re not there. '
            'On the finance, we’re not there. Since 2009, we’ve said we will '
            'be providing $100bn to the developing countries by 2020, and '
            'we’ve still not got to that amount either.” On top of that, Lucas '
            'says, “The richer countries have not provided the [Covid] '
            'vaccines that they promised to poorer countries. I think the '
            'developing countries are going to arrive in Glasgow feeling '
            'incredibly let down.” Still, she says, smiling as she speaks via '
            'Zoom from her home in Brighton, there are glimmers of hope. “The '
            'public pressure and movements are gathering like never before. We '
            'know the public want leadership on this – they want the '
            'government to go further, they are absolutely up for bolder and '
            'more ambitious action. I take some hope from that, but on the '
            'evidence right now, I think it’s not too late, but it’s going to '
            'be tough.” Lucas has called Cop26 “our last best chance”. What '
            'will happen if it’s not successful? “This is the moment where it '
            'feels like public pressure and awareness is at its greatest. We '
            'know that this decade is going to be just about the most '
            'consequential in human history if we are serious about the '
            'existential threat that the climate crisis poses to humanity. But '
            'I’m also aware that if we don’t get a good result, it doesn’t '
            'mean we should all pack up, go home and give up. Every single '
            'fraction of a degree makes a difference in terms of climate '
            'impact, every single tonne of carbon emitted makes a difference. '
            'So we still have to keep fighting for the next best moment.”\n'
            'Lucas also knows we are running out of “moments”. Her biggest '
            'fear is, “That we don’t act fast enough. That we exceed 1.5 '
            'degrees, that we get towards two degrees of warming and more of '
            'the extreme events that scientists have been warning are linked '
            'to the climate emergency really accelerate.” One of her favourite '
            'films is Franny Armstrong’s docudrama The Age of Stupid, set in '
            '2055 – with its cities under floods or on fire, it looks more '
            'familiar this year than it did when it came out in 2009 – and she '
            'says a line from it still makes the hairs stand up on the back of '
            'her neck: “‘Why is it, knowing what we knew then, we didn’t act '
            'when there was still time?’ And frankly that is the question I go '
            'to bed thinking about, and wake up thinking about.” Lucas was '
            'elected as the MP for Brighton Pavilion in 2010, and is still the '
            'country’s first and only Green MP. She grew up in Malvern, where '
            'her father ran a small business – her parents were “most '
            'definitely Conservatives” and politics wasn’t part of her '
            'childhood. “I came late to it,” she says. As a bookish child, she '
            'was most interested in poetry and novels; she went on to do a PhD '
            'in 16th-century literary romance. In the early 80s, at university '
            'in Exeter, Lucas got involved with the anti-nuclear movement and '
            'the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). “That’s what got me '
            'into politics more broadly,” she says. Although she never stayed '
            'at Greenham Common, visiting the protest “was my kind of '
            'introduction to the broader political world”. When she worked in '
            'the CND bookshop in Exeter, Lucas read Jonathon Porritt’s book '
            'Seeing Green, “which put together concerns around the '
            'anti-nuclear movement with concerns around the women’s movement '
            'and poverty and environmental policies. For the first time in my '
            'life, I saw some of the connections. It was a sort of a lightbulb '
            'moment, coming across that book and realising there was actually '
            'a political party that linked to these different symptoms of a '
            'wider problem, which is basically an economic model that puts '
            'profit and growth above people and planet.” One of the problems '
            'environmental campaigners face, apart from terrifying us, is how '
            'to sell the big changes we all – or at least those with affluent '
            'lifestyles – need to make. This is one of Lucas’s strengths, I '
            'think, because she is both clever and practical, and always seems '
            'pretty cheerful despite her dire warnings. On rampant '
            'consumerism, she says: “People are still going to need – and want '
            '– to consume things but there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that '
            'people get very frustrated, for example, when products have '
            'built-in obsolescence. A very popular policy that comes up again '
            'and again is a proper right to repair.” It would be great to have '
            'repair cafes everywhere, she says, where you can get your broken '
            'toaster mended “while you’re having a coffee, chatting with '
            'friends”. Not upgrading your phone every other year, she says, '
            '“is not seriously going to undermine people’s quality of life, '
            'but will give us a better chance of a life that’s liveable for '
            'everybody into the future”.\n'
            'There are always ways to design fair policies “that people buy '
            'into”, she says. Take flying, for example. “The citizens’ '
            'assemblies came out really strongly for a frequent flyer levy. '
            'That means if you were to take one flight a year, it will be much '
            'the same price as it is now. But as soon as you start taking the '
            'second, third, fourth, fifth, the price ratchets up steeply – '
            'that reflects the fact that 70% of flights are taken by just 15% '
            'of the population. It’s a small number, relatively speaking, '
            'taking a hell of a lot of flights that is driving the biggest '
            'rise in emissions.” What is frustrating, she says, is how so many '
            'of the policies that would also “get us off our current collision '
            'course with catastrophe” wouldn’t be about giving things up, but '
            'about improving life. “What is not to like about the vast '
            'majority of this agenda? Yet still we have governments who aren’t '
            'moving in the right direction.” The recently announced heat and '
            'buildings strategy – the one that said we should all have heat '
            'pumps – made Lucas furious, she says. Not only were the subsidies '
            'insufficient, but: “They put almost nothing into home insulation. '
            'It’s utterly inefficient and wasteful, and doesn’t work. If we '
            'had a comprehensive street-by-street, local authority-led home '
            'insulation programme, that would get people’s fuel bills down, '
            'improve people’s health, get climate emissions down, create '
            'millions of jobs all around the country. There are so many '
            'win-wins.” It was the same with other green initiatives. “It '
            'feels like you cannot underestimate this government’s ability to '
            'balls up good ideas,” says Lucas. About Boris Johnson, she is '
            'scathing. “He’s an absolute disaster as a prime minister. He '
            'doesn’t do what is right, he does what he thinks is popular.” On '
            'the Covid-19 crisis, “It has been so apparent that he waits until '
            'the last moment to act. He is utterly indecisive, doesn’t want to '
            'be unpopular and doesn’t want to take leadership. And, as a '
            'result, Britain has had one of the worst total death rates in the '
            'western world.” It also makes Johnson, Lucas believes, “uniquely '
            'ill-equipped to deal with a crisis like climate change, where you '
            'need public trust. At a time of crisis, whether that’s Covid or '
            'climate, you need leaders who have integrity, consistency and '
            'courage. And those are three words I would not associate with '
            'Boris Johnson.” As for the conference speech made by the Labour '
            'leader, Keir Starmer, “You had to wait over an hour to get '
            'anything on climate and it felt like it was one issue among many '
            'that needed to be addressed. It wasn’t the context within which '
            'all of those other announcements and decisions were being '
            'situated.”\n'
            'The government’s messaging is all over the place, says Lucas. In '
            'the summer, the Cop26 spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, was mocked '
            'for saying people should take small steps to combat climate '
            'change (she acknowledged it was not the whole answer) such as not '
            'rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Lucas '
            'laughs, incredulous. “It insulted people’s intelligence – people '
            'know that the actions we need have to be commensurate to the '
            'scale of the crisis. You cannot say that this is the greatest '
            'threat to humanity, and then [advise] not rinsing dishes before '
            'you put them in the dishwasher. It’s the inconsistency that is so '
            'debilitating.” When Lucas boards the train to Glasgow this week, '
            'she says it will cost her four times more than if she were to '
            'take a cheap flight. “Lots of people aren’t in the privileged '
            'position I’m in to be able to say, ‘OK, in spite of that, I’ll go '
            'for that option.’ So let’s make it easier for people to do the '
            'right thing.” Does she think there will be a Green government in '
            'her lifetime? She smiles. “Yes, I do. Because if there isn’t, '
            'then unless there’s a Damascene conversion of the other parties, '
            'the future is looking pretty grim. I’m not saying that the Green '
            'party is the only party that has the answers, but we’ve been '
            'asking the right questions for a hell of a lot longer.” The party '
            'is hampered by the voting system: “Clearly, a change in the '
            'voting system is what is necessary before Greens can take the '
            'position I would say we should rightfully have, if you look at '
            'the level of support for the party.” But it’s also a party with '
            'divisions over issues such as gender, as well as its frequent '
            'leadership changes – Lucas, who was leader between 2008 and 2012, '
            'is still probably its only recognisable face – and complicated '
            'internal democracy. It had record local election results this '
            'year, but the Green party still looks far from a meaningful '
            'power.\n'
            'What does she think of Insulate Britain’s tactics? Last week, the '
            'protest group, which is campaigning to insulate all British homes '
            'by 2030, blocked roads on to the M25. “I think the tactics have '
            'become the story, so actually, we spend much less time talking '
            'about the need to insulate Britain and more time about whether or '
            'not it’s legitimate to take the actions they are doing,” says '
            'Lucas. “Although I’m absolutely a supporter of peaceful direct '
            'action, and have been arrested and acquitted myself for doing the '
            'same thing [in 2013 during a protest against fracking], I would '
            'feel more comfortable protesting on the issue of insulation '
            'outside the Treasury where they’ve got the money to be putting '
            'into those programmes, rather than on the M25 where motorists '
            'don’t have a lot of say over what policies get rolled out.” One '
            'of the biggest lessons from her decades of environmental '
            'activism, she says, “is that change can sometimes happen very '
            'suddenly and in unpredictable ways”. Sometimes, change is almost '
            'overnight. One recent example was the government’s U-turn over '
            'sewage spills last week, placing a legal duty on water companies '
            'to reduce sewage discharges into rivers and the sea from storm '
            'overflows. “We were told it was absolutely impossible to change, '
            'that it will cost far too much and, in any case, the government’s '
            'policy was just fine. Then, within a matter of days, that '
            'changed. The thing that keeps you going is the idea that things '
            'can happen fast and sometimes you don’t know what will bring '
            'about that breakthrough.” Change, says Lucas, doesn’t have to be '
            'slow. Which is just as well.',

{'article': 'The UK automotive industry is privately lobbying against the '
            'proposed 2040 introduction of a ban on sales of new diesel '
            'trucks, amid a split between manufacturers over when heavy goods '
            'vehicles should abandon fossil fuels. In July the government '
            'revealed plans to ban internal combustion engines in new lorries '
            'after 2040, following a ban on petrol and diesel cars after 2035 '
            'to help tackle the climate crisis. It is now consulting on the '
            'measure. The automotive lobby group, the Society for Motor '
            'Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), says publicly that the proposed '
            'ban is a “bold commitment” that would require financial support '
            'from the government. However, it has told MPs privately that a '
            'ban should be delayed, according to responses to the official '
            'consultation. The responses were obtained through a formal '
            'request by InfluenceMap, a thinktank that tracks climate '
            'lobbying, which shared them with the Guardian. The Road Haulage '
            'Association (RHA), which represents trucking companies, said the '
            'ban should be delayed until 2045 for lorries over 32 tonnes in '
            'weight. It supported earlier bans for smaller lorries. Some '
            'individual truckmakers do support bans on fossil fuel internal '
            'combustion engines in heavy goods vehicles in 2040 or earlier, '
            'the responses show. They include Volvo Trucks and Renault, both '
            'owned by Volvo Group, the world’s second biggest truckmaker, as '
            'well as DAF Trucks and Tesla. Car sales are already moving '
            'rapidly to electric power, but heavy goods vehicles are much '
            'harder to electrify because of the heavy loads they carry over '
            'long distances, making batteries much less effective. Lorries '
            'were responsible for 19m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019, 16% of '
            'UK emissions from transport, according to government figures. Ben '
            'Youriev, a transport analyst at InfluenceMap, said: “Cutting '
            'emissions from road transport will be critically important for '
            'the UK achieving its net zero targets, yet the UK’s automotive '
            'industry group is lobbying to make that task harder. The SMMT is '
            'siding with its most regressive members to oppose a 2040 UK '
            'phase-out date for heavy-duty vehicles, despite the '
            'recommendations of the UK’s Climate Change Committee.” The SMMT '
            'consultation response said: “Without clarity on the viable future '
            'solutions required for zero-emission HGVs, we do not support '
            'setting an end-of-sale date.” It said the industry was committed '
            'to zero-emission HGVs “where technology options are viable and '
            'the business case for investment allows”, but that “some specific '
            'use cases are likely to be more challenging”.\n'
            'Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said in a statement: '
            '“SMMT and its members do not oppose setting an end-of-sale date, '
            'but we need plans before bans. The HGV sector is committed to be '
            'fossil fuel free by 2040 and in some use cases it will be '
            'possible to switch to zero-emission trucks before this date – but '
            'at present there is no clear alternative technology available for '
            'every single HGV operation.” Rod McKenzie, the managing director '
            'of policy at the RHA, said more time was needed for the largest '
            'lorries only because the technology to power them was not yet '
            'available. He said that would mean small delivery companies were '
            'faced with financial risks when buying new vehicles. “It’s not '
            'that we’re against cleaner air or phasing out diesel lorries,” he '
            'said. “The question has always been the timescale.” Tesla, the '
            'world’s most valuable automotive company, was a notable advocate '
            'in its response for the earliest ban possible, arguing for 2035. '
            'Controlled by Elon Musk, whose stake has made him the richest man '
            'in history, Tesla is aiming to produce the Semi, a heavy goods '
            'vehicle powered by batteries. However, the Semi is still “in '
            'development” despite Musk in 2017 saying it would start '
            'production in 2019. • This article was amended on 1 November '
            '2021. A reference to truckmakers supporting bans on “internal '
            'combustion engines” in heavy goods vehicles in 2040 or earlier, '
            'should instead have referred specifically to fossil fuel internal '
            'combustion engines.',

{'article': 'The short-term forecast is for a storm – or maybe a squally '
            'shower – of Cop26-inspired Tempests. On 7 November, BBC Radio 3 '
            'is fielding a soft-spoken Ian McDiarmid as Prospero in '
            'Shakespeare’s island reverie and here in Glasgow, as the climate '
            'delegates assemble, director Andy Arnold has put together an '
            '11-strong, all-female Tempest, led by Nicole Cooper. Neither '
            'production overstates the eco connections, each preferring the '
            'story does its own work. This is a play about a man-made weather '
            'event leading to a bunch of Europeans taking over a foreign '
            'territory, exploiting it, then getting out again. The latter idea '
            'is picked up by Arnold, who leaves Itxaso Moreno’s athletic Ariel '
            'and Liz Kettle’s proud Caliban forlorn and abandoned at the end '
            'of the 90-minute show. They have been used and discarded, the '
            'dream-like visions of their visitors a lingering nightmare for '
            'them. The set by Jenny Booth, which gets an environmental tick '
            'for recycling prop-store furniture, places Cooper, dramatically, '
            'on the sill beneath one of the exposed stained-glass windows on '
            'the theatre’s back wall. This is Prospero’s high-level library, a '
            'vantage point to cast his spells over the supernatural '
            'inhabitants, the shipwrecked sailors and Titana Muthui’s Miranda, '
            'a surly, eye-rolling teenager rather than the sweet-natured '
            'ingenue of tradition. There is something of the sociopath in '
            'Cooper’s portrayal. This is a Prospero who is all charm and '
            'charisma when things are going his way, but step out of line and '
            'he turns vicious. Blaming Ariel for the sprite’s own misfortunes '
            'feels like gaslighting. Abusing Caliban is the colonial mindset '
            'at its most arrogant. There are more reasons than adolescent '
            'hormones to make Miranda sceptical about her dad, a man who '
            'combines suave assurance and callous control. With Benny '
            'Goodman’s lighting splashing fiery reds and stark whites from the '
            'wings, it is a dreamy, fluid production, but one that skates over '
            'some of the key moments. Where is the wonder when Miranda sets '
            'eyes on her first eligible man, or the shock when the sailors '
            'encounter Caliban? But if such transitions are underplayed, a '
            'show that boldly questions the means of production is also '
            'thoughtful and imaginative. The Tempest is at Tron theatre, '
            'Glasgow, until 13 November.',

{'article': 'Children in affluent areas of England are twice as likely to have '
            'access to youth clubs and other out-of-school activities as those '
            'in poorer locations, the first national snapshot of youth '
            'services in more than a decade has revealed. The gulf emerged in '
            'a survey by the National Youth Agency (NYA) of close to 8,500 '
            'organisations providing youth services including national groups '
            'such as the Boys’ Brigade, the Woodcraft Folk, YMCA and the '
            'Marine Society & Sea Cadets, as well as councils. The majority of '
            'provision was offered by Scouts and Girlguiding.\n'
            'The survey also found youth buildings are more than twice as '
            'likely to be purpose-built for or aimed towards young people in '
            'affluent areas than in deprived areas, where facilities are more '
            'likely to be shared. The survey, funded by the Youth Futures '
            'Foundation, comes after official figures last week showed that '
            'close to 13,000 children in England were identified by social '
            'services in 2020/21 as being at risk of criminal exploitation by '
            'gangs, which Anne Longfield, chair of the Commission on Young '
            'Lives described as “extremely troubling”. In the top 10% most '
            'affluent postcode areas there were twice as many youth groups '
            'compared as in the 10% most deprived, it found. The largest '
            'clusters of the most deprived areas in England are in Greater '
            'Manchester, the West Midlands, the north-east, Yorkshire and '
            'parts of London. The most affluent postcodes, often suburban and '
            'rural, include ares in counties such as Berkshire, Cheshire and '
            'Devon. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week announced a '
            'settlement for youth services, badged as delivering “up to 300 '
            'youth facilities” but which youth leaders now fear could result '
            'in an overall reduction in funding previously pledged. The £560m '
            'offered over three years appears to include a £500m youth '
            'investment fund announced in 2019 and funding for the National '
            'Citizen Service, which offers residential trips to 16- and '
            '17-year-olds. The NYA estimates £1bn less is being spent on youth '
            'services annually than a decade ago. The YMCA has previously '
            'calculated that youth services in England have experienced a 73% '
            'real-terms funding cut from local authorities since 2010. “There '
            'needs to be equal access to youth provision and it shouldn’t '
            'depend on postcode or [whether you live in] an affluent area,” '
            'said Leigh Middleton, the chief executive of the NYA, who '
            'described the figures as “very stark”. “The priority should be '
            'set by where the need is greatest and supporting all young people '
            'to have equal access to youth provision.” The survey was '
            'dominated by responses from uniformed groups – 45% were from '
            'Girlguiding and 41% from Scouts – but the NYA said while this may '
            'overstate their role in youth services, they are likely to '
            'account for a majority of provision. In total, 16% of the '
            'organisations that responded were local authority youth services, '
            'faith groups and smaller community organisations. The snapshot '
            'also revealed how demand for youth services that address mental '
            'health are being swamped by demand. Two-thirds of organisations '
            'supporting mental health, wellbeing and related issues had '
            'waiting lists, rising to three-quarters in the most deprived '
            'areas. By contrast, half of those offering physical health and '
            'sport had waiting lists. Waiting lists were longer for providers '
            'of almost all kinds of services in deprived areas, with almost '
            'half of organisations addressing youth employment having a '
            'waiting list in the poorest areas, compared with just over a '
            'quarter in the wealthiest ones. A DCMS spokesperson said: “Last '
            'week we announced plans to invest £560m to make sure youth '
            'services get the support they need, and this includes funding the '
            'construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in '
            'the most deprived areas of the country. “We also confirmed a '
            '£500m extension of our schemes to help young people find new '
            'opportunities and better paid work, over £200m to continue the '
            'holiday activities and food programme, and a further £1.8bn to '
            'support schools’ recovery from the pandemic and help the most '
            'disadvantaged pupils – which takes overall funding dedicated '

{'article': 'The International Handball Federation has responded to widespread '
            'accusations of sexism by changing its rules around women’s '
            'uniforms to allow bike shorts and tank tops instead of bikini '
            'bottoms and crop tops. The sport’s global governing body has been '
            'the subject of international pressure since July, when the '
            'European Handball Federation made headlines for imposing a €1,500 '
            'fine on the Norwegian women’s beach handball team for wearing '
            'shorts like their male counterparts during the Euro 21 tournament '
            'in Bulgaria. At the time, the EHF described the shorts as '
            '“improper clothing”.\n'
            'At some point over the past month the IHF has quietly altered its '
            'regulations for beach handball, which now stipulate that “female '
            'athletes must wear short tight pants with a close fit”. Male '
            'athletes can still wear regular shorts as long as 10cm above the '
            'knee “if not too baggy”. It follows a campaign by Norway-based '
            'Australian activist Talitha Stone, whose petition – supported by '
            'gender equality organisation Collective Shout – attracted 61,000 '
            'signatures. “I hope this is the beginning of the end of sexism '
            'and objectification of women and girls in sport,” said Stone, who '
            'led Collective Shout’s 2012 campaign against the Lingerie '
            'Football League. “And that in future all women and girls will be '
            'free to participate in sport without fear of wardrobe '
            'malfunctions and sexual harassment.”\n'
            'In July, US pop star Pink threw her support behind the Norwegian '
            'team, tweeting her pride in them “protesting the very sexist '
            'rules” and offering to pay their fines. The country’s minister '
            'for culture and sport, Abid Raja, described the ruling as being '
            '“completely ridiculous” and women’s sports associations across '
            'Europe also called for the resignation of the presidents of both '
            'the IHF and the EHF. Last month, the sports ministers from five '
            'European countries – Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and '
            'Finland – wrote a joint letter to the IHF urging them to update '
            'archaic dress regulations “not only to accommodate current female '
            'athletes, but also to support and encourage all athletes '
            'regardless of their gender or background to remain in sport”. At '
            'the time, the IHF rules stated that female players playing beach '
            'handball must wear “tops and bikini bottoms and eventual '
            'accessories”, while male players wear “tank tops and shorts and '
            'eventual accessories”.\n'
            'Even now, there are differences in terms of requirements for '
            'women to wear uniforms that are “body fit” and “tight” when there '
            'is no corresponding rule for men. Female athletes have spoken out '
            'against uniform double standards numerous times. Women are '
            'required to wear more revealing outfits in several sports, '
            'including track and field, beach volleyball and tennis. In 2011, '
            'the Badminton World Federation decreed that women must wear '
            'skirts or dresses to play at the elite level in order to help '
            'revive flagging interest in women’s badminton. A decade later, in '

            'general, Mark Dreyfus, that the former attorney general’s failure '
            'to declare the ultimate source of funds breached disclosure '
            'rules. The committee also confirmed to Dreyfus it is considering '
            'the complaint.\n'
            'Both moves suggest that despite the Morrison government using its '
            'House of Representatives majority to defeat a motion to refer the '
            'issue, the member for Pearce’s declaration is nevertheless being '
            'scrutinised. On Monday a spokesperson for Porter told Guardian '
            'Australia: “The member will respond to any correspondence '
            'received from the committee in due course.” In September, Porter '
            'disclosed that the “Legal Services Trust” had part-paid fees '
            'arising from the private defamation case he instigated against '
            'the ABC. The former attorney general said that as a “potential '
            'beneficiary” of what he described as a blind trust he had no '
            'access to information about the source of the funds. The Dreyfus '
            'complaint, sent on 18 October, noted that the register requires '
            'gifts worth more than $750 to be declared and that, despite '
            'Porter’s disclosure, the House has no idea who or what the '
            'ultimate sources of funds were. In parliamentary debate, Labor’s '
            'Tony Burke labelled the trust a “brown paper bag stitched '
            'together by lawyers”. Burke noted Porter’s public assurances that '
            'no “foreign donors” or people on the lobbyist register had '
            'donated to the trust. “So he has made clear that he can find out '
            'whose money is in this trust, from which he has personally '
            'benefited for a personal bill,” Burke said. Dreyfus’s letter '
            'similarly argued that Porter’s reasons for not disclosing are not '
            'valid, and queried whether he had “acted contrary to House '
            'resolutions on the registration of members’ interests”. Porter '
            'maintains he has properly disclosed his interests in accordance '
            'with both the rules and the ministerial standards, but resigned '
            'as a minister in September on the basis the issue had become an '
            '“unhelpful distraction” for the government. On the day he '
            'resigned, Porter said in a statement he was “not willing to put '
            'pressure on the trust to provide me with any further information '
            '… to which I am not entitled”. Porter said he did not want to '
            'expose people who donated to the trust to “become targets of the '
            'social media mob”.\n'
            'The leader of the House, Peter Dutton, has asked the privileges '
            'committee to consider clarifying the rules around disclosure of '
            'donations for legal cases, a request that could encompass '
            'consideration of how members are interpreting the rules, but did '
            'not ask for a ruling on Porter’s declaration. Because Dreyfus’s '
            'complaint accused Porter of breaching the rules, the committee '
            'resolved, in line with standard procedure, to offer him a right '
            'of reply. The committee also received a written complaint from '
            'the Greens senator Larissa Waters. The committee has not ruled '
            'out making findings against individual MPs. In considering '
            'whether to allow debate on the motion to refer Porter, the former '
            'speaker Tony Smith found there was a “prima facie case” to '
            'investigate Porter for an alleged breach, but added that “does '
            'not imply a conclusion that a breach of privilege or contempt has '
            'occurred”. In October Scott Morrison sought to manage fallout '
            'from the government blocking the attempted referral of Porter, by '
            'insisting the broader consideration of clarifying rules around '
            'disclosure when members are faced with defamation proceedings '
            'would look into the controversy. “The suggestion that somehow '
            'things are not being looked into, that things have not been '
            'referred to [the committee], is not the case,” Morrison told the '
            'House in question time. “We’ve referred these matters directly to '
            'the chair of the privileges committee to consider these issues.”',

{'article': 'When Senait Lara, a 28-year-old video producer in Los Angeles, '
            'was confronted by her friends about her lack of communication in '
            'their group chat, the accusations were as follows: she only '
            'caught up every few days; when she did, it was barely an '
            'interaction – Lara spent time “hearting” messages instead of '
            'responding with words; and sometimes she would never respond at '
            'all. Lara did not deny it. She knew she sometimes preferred to '
            'throw her phone in a corner and completely avoid it rather than '
            'deal with the onslaught of requests.\n'
            'It wasn’t until Lara addressed her behaviour in therapy that she '
            'realized she felt anxious from texting because of her tendency to '
            'please those around her. As her therapist described, '
            'people-pleasers are less likely to have boundaries around '
            'communication, which smartphones barely provide. “I never '
            'understood why I would be so difficult to communicate with, but '
            'then I realized it was all online,” she said. In person, Lara '
            'felt comfortable talking with people, but when communication came '
            'down to a text message, an email, or a direct message, she wanted '
            'to tap out. While social media and messaging apps claim to keep '
            'us more connected to each other, many younger users are finding '
            'themselves exhausted from receiving constant notifications, '
            'balancing numerous exchanges at once, and carrying conversations '
            'that can last all day – and sometimes over the course of a week. '
            'The after-effect? Delayed responses, forgetting to get back to '
            'someone entirely, and a need for frequent phone breaks. In fact, '
            'a 2020 study exploring the effects of information overload and '
            'online conversation dynamics found that “over-exposure to '
            'information can suppress the likelihood of response by '
            'overloading users, contrary to analogies to biologically-inspired '
            'viral spread”. It makes sense that millennials are feeling '
            'extremely overloaded. While social media use has increased among '
            'older adults, they are less likely to use multiple social media '
            'platforms, or to highly engage in them, making them less '
            'susceptible to technological burnout. Instead, studies show that '
            'older generations use social media platformsto keep up with '
            'family and to compensate for missed in-person interactions, '
            'rather than branding themselves or seeking opportunities, which '
            'results in less time and less engagement. Some avoid social media '
            'platforms completely because of technological disadvantages or '
            'fear of security breaches. Millennials, on the other hand – '
            'people born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s – have been '
            'described as the burnout generation. It’s a generation that has '
            'matured in a technological world that allows for work, '
            'information, and communication to follow them everywhere. Throw '
            'in the increase we have seen in ways to communicate since the '
            'pandemic and you have gridlock. People are overwhelmed. From Zoom '
            'meetings and FaceTime dates to Slack blurring the lines between '
            'work and casual chat, connecting online has grown rapidly since '
            '2019. There was a 61% increase in social media engagement during '
            'the first wave of the pandemic, and that wasn’t just for the love '
            'of it: 73% of users expressed a negative sentiment towards social '
            'media in the past year. With vaccination rollouts and pandemic '
            'precautions easing, there is some relief on the horizon, but '
            'people are feeling burned out from spending much of 2020 online. '
            'The average American has 47 unread text messages and 1,602 '
            'unopened emails. And yet, the average phone screen time for '
            'American adults is 4.2 hours per day – more than ever before. '
            'This suggests people are spending more time on their phones, and '
            'still have less time to complete conversations. Now people are '
            'faced with social media apps like Instagram, Twitter, and '
            'Facebook which encourage interaction through likes and shares; '
            'instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Messenger, '
            'which encourage long threads of conversation and group chats; and '
            'the traditional forms of communication like email and text '
            'messaging. The resulting number of conversations is almost '
            'unbelievable: the average person checks their phone 262 times a '
            'day, a major increase from the 80 times a day average in 2016. '
            'The frequent digital contact leaves people feeling overwhelmed '
            'and unable to participate at all. Like ghosting a date – common '
            'on dating apps, where it’s the norm to have many conversations '
            'going at once – people stop responding to acquaintances, loved '
            'ones and friends. Emily Balcetis, an associate professor of '
            'psychology at New York University, recommends creating '
            'communication boundaries to manage the onslaught. This might '
            'include investing in an old-school alarm clock to have by your '
            'bedside so you can leave your phone charging in another room, or '
            'having cut-off times for email communication. Switching off '
            'around bedtime hours, she says, means “you can give your brain a '
            'break before you fall asleep and have a gentler start to the '
            'day.” On email, people increasingly feel obliged to be constantly '
            'responsive, especially when all sorts of assumptions are made '
            'based on your email etiquette – like how much of a “competitive '
            'edge” one has. Balcetis suggests deciding on a reasonable window '
            'of time to check on and respond to emails, and using email '
            'signatures to flag in-office hours and days you don’t check '
            'emails. Smartphones have quickly transformed into handheld '
            'storage units for our conversations, thoughts,music and '
            'everything else. That shift to feeling constantly attached to our '
            'phones as if they were a limb, relates to the burnout, says '
            'Balcetis. Now there’s an app for everything, and with most apps '
            'come push notifications and ways to connect with other users, '
            'even when communication isn’t the leading purpose of the app.\n'
            'Take Glow for example, a period and fertility tracker app. The '
            'app, which functions as a calendar, also encourages users to join '
            'group chats to compare experiences with its community of over 15 '
            'million women. Everything from fitness apps like Strava to recipe '
            'apps like BigOven encourage people to do the same. We could all '
            'just opt out of push notifications, but an unspoken obligation '
            'remains: to always be available as long as your phone is within '
            'reach. Ultimately, it boils down to belonging, which Balcetis '
            'says is an inherent need for humans. People have a sense of fomo '
            '– a fear of missing out – when they are not engaged. The term was '
            'originally popularized to reference anxiety about missing social '
            'events, but with smartphones acting as our society’s primary mode '
            'of communication, this has extended to being online. It speaks to '
            'why Lara’s friends felt rejected by her lacklustre responses: '
            'they sent a distorted message to her friends, that she was not '
            'invested in their relationships. According to Balcetis, the '
            'negativity dominance effect – our brain’s natural tendency to '
            'intensify perceived negativity or threats – results in this '
            'assumption. “Any sort of negative feedback, which can take the '
            'form of just non-responsiveness; people not putting a heart on '
            'something; or somebody not responding quickly enough, is going to '
            'loom large in our mind’s eye and have a disproportionate impact '
            'on our wellbeing,” Balcetis explained. Once Lara was able to '
            'accept her uncomfortable relationship with her phone, she started '
            'to tell her friends that she steps away from it at times, which '
            'has led to some friendships weakening – but others fared better. '
            'As smartphones have become essential devices, adaptions are '
            'constantly made to help users connect faster, and more '
            'frequently. In 2016, Apple launched Tapbacks, or emoji reactions '
            'for messages. Instead of responding with a written text, people '
            'can now place a heart, a thumbs up, a thumbs down, a ‘“haha!”, a '
            'double exclamation point, or a question mark on a text message. '
            'Similarly, Instagram this year implemented sticker reactions to '
            'Stories. The update allows users to react to a story with '
            'laughing, surprised, heart eyes, teary-eyed, clap, fire, '
            'celebration or the 100 emoji. These features allow users to '
            'respond to someone’s post or message in less than a second. It '
            'also means opening communication with people we wouldn’t hold '
            'conversations with in person, blurring the lines between who is a '
            'friend and who is just an acquaintance. Kirsten Chen, a '
            '24-year-old creative editor in New York, describes the outreach '
            'from people she isn’t close to, mostly frivolous connections on '
            'social media, as annoying and entitled. “All of these people are '
            'asking me for so many things and think that they know me on this '
            'level where they get access to me,” she says. The constant '
            'communication also makes her feel guilty: “I would like to help '
            'as many people as I can, and be a good friend or acquaintance, '
            'but I don’t have the bandwidth to deal with all y’all,” she '
            'explains. Chen’s response rate is reflective of who is most '
            'relevant to her. If the message isn’t urgent, but comes from '
            'someone she talks to frequently, she might respond in six to 10 '
            'hours. And if the message is from someone she isn’t interested in '
            'or is about something she doesn’t care about, it could be a few '
            'days or a week before she offers a response. Even with this '
            'method, she’s recently racked up 12,460 unopened emails, 182 '
            'unread texts, and an unmeasurable number of Instagram DMs.\n'
            'To some people, the sight of multiple unread notifications can '
            'trigger feelings of anxiety. Kevin Schoenblum, a 25-year-old UR '
            'designer in Washington, mass deletes emails and text messages '
            'once a week to avoid the red unread bubble on their phone screen. '
            'Sometimes it results in missing messages. “The idea that I owe a '
            'response to someone or that someone’s waiting to hear back from '
            'me creates this cycle of guilt and shame and stress,” they said. '
            'Fortunately, those who are close to Schoenblum are aware of their '
            'communication habits and don’t expect immediacy in response time '
            'unless it’s urgent. Recently diagnosed with ADHD, Schoenblum says '
            'the diagnosis gave them more understanding as to why '
            'notifications do not hold their attention as much as seeing '
            'someone’s face and hearing their voice. As the pressure to be '
            'online and always available continues to grow in our society, '
            'in-person interactions provide far more authentic communication '
            'than digital ones. From body language and tone of voice to eye '
            'contact and all the other social cues that exist in real life '
            'that aren’t available in a text message, it’s far easier to be '
            'present when you’re face-to-face. As Balcetis notes: “At the end '
            'of the day, I think what we’re looking for is not more ways to '
            'stay connected, but higher quality ways to be connected.”',

{'article': 'A suspect has been arrested for attempted murder after 17 people '
            'were injured in a knife and fire attack on a train in Tokyo that '
            'was carried out by a man wearing a Joker costume. Witnesses told '
            'public broadcaster NHK how petrified passengers had fled to '
            'adjoining carriages and jumped out of windows during the attack, '
            'which occurred on Sunday, when the Japanese capital was full of '
            'Halloween revellers, many in costume. The suspect, who has been '
            'named as 24-year-old Kyota Hattori, told police he “adores” the '
            'Joker character from the Batman films, according to the Kyodo '
            'news agency. He was quoted by police as saying he had wanted to '
            'kill multiple people and receive the death penalty, it added. '
            'Photos and videos posted on social media showed a man wearing a '
            'green shirt and purple suit. He allegedly attacked passengers on '
            'the Keio Line train with a knife and started a fire inside the '
            'carriage using lighter fluid. Kyodo said a male passenger in his '
            '70s was in critical condition after being stabbed in the chest. '
            'Sixteen other people suffered minor injuries, including smoke '
            'inhalation. Top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno described '
            'the incident as “atrocious and brutal” on Monday. A video clip '
            'published by NHK showed panicked passengers running down the '
            'train as smoke filled the carriage, with flames also visible. '
            'Another video posted on Twitter showed people climbing through '
            'windows to escape the train at a station. The line operator said '
            'services had been partially suspended after “an incident '
            'involving injuries” took place just before 8pm near Kokuryō in '
            'the city’s western suburbs. The express train had been bound for '
            'Shinjuku, the world’s busiest railway station. “At first I '
            'thought it was something like a Halloween event. But I rushed '
            'away as a man carrying a long knife came in. I was very fortunate '
            'not to be injured,” a man who was on the train told NHK. The '
            'perpetrator showed no emotion during the attack, a female '
            'passenger said. “He held a knife and started spreading liquid,” '
            'she said. “He was committing this act without showing any '
            'emotion, just mechanically. I think that brought fear to '
            'everyone.”\n'
            'Dozens of firefighters and police officers were seen working '
            'outside the station. Violent crime is rare in Japan, but in '
            'August nine people were wounded, one of them seriously, in a '
            'stabbing on a commuter train in Tokyo, with the suspect fleeing '
            'the scene and later handing himself in. In a separate attack in '
            'August, two people suffered burns in an acid attack at a Tokyo '
            'subway station. Japan has strict gun laws, but there are '
            'occasional violent crimes involving other weapons. In 2019, a man '
            'killed two people, including a schoolgirl, and wounded more than '
            'a dozen in a rampage that targeted children as they waited for a '
            'bus. And in 2018, a man was arrested in central Japan after '
            'stabbing one person to death and injuring two others on a bullet '
            'train.',

            '“accounting tricks” to create a target for greenhouse gas '
            'emissions cuts that looks far more ambitious than it really is. '
            'On Sunday the country pledged to halve its emissions by 2030 '
            'aspart of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5C. '
            'The announcement was made on the eve of the United Nations Cop26 '

            'increase of all industrialised countries. Earlier this year, data '
            'showed New Zealand’s emissions had increased by 2% in 2018-19. '
            'The Climate Action Tracker has given the country a “highly '
            'insufficient” rating, pointing out that despite net-zero '
            'emissions by 2050 being enshrined in law, the government’s '
            'policies focus too heavily on offsetting carbon overseas and '
            'through forestry, rather than addressing the root causes such as '
            'agriculture. Bill Hare, from Climate Analytics, a partner '
            'organisation to Climate Action Tracker said New Zealand’s latest '
            'announcement employs “various accounting tricks”.\n'
            '“The headline target that the government has put forward as a 50% '
            'reduction from 2005 levels of emissions is what the general '
            'public hears, however the government has taken a number of '
            'unusual accounting approaches that, when analysed, indicate that '
            'the real emission reductions achieved compared to 2005 levels of '
            'net emissions is only 22-23%,” he said. “The allowed net '
            'emissions in 2030 are calculated as a percentage of gross '
            'emissions in 2005, essentially comparing apples and oranges. '
            'Gross emissions in 2005 was significantly higher than 2005 '
            'emissions.” Global industry campaign manager at Oil Change '
            'International, David Tong, said it was similar to the difference '
            'between looking at gross income, and pay after tax. “What’s been '
            'compared is a total emissions in 2005, to our total emissions, if '
            'we achieve this target, in 2030, less the sequestration from '
            'forestry and other carbon sequestration within New Zealand. So '
            'those are two different data sets.” Part of the problem, is that '
            'the government is using Kyoto Protocol accounting rules, which '
            'have become less common, rather than the International Panel on '
            'Climate Change data method. “If you want to compare our targets '
            'to what is necessary for 1.5C, as both the prime minister and '
            'minister James Shaw have done, then it’s really important that '
            'you use the same numbers as the world’s top scientists,” he said. '
            'Professor Bronwyn Hayward, from the University of Canterbury and '
            'an author for the IPCC report, said Climate Action Tracker has '
            'long argued that if New Zealand’s commitments are to be '
            'consistent with limiting warming to 1.5˚C, the country should set '
            'a 2030 target to reduce gross emissions by at least 44%. “What we '
            'have done instead is to set an estimated net target of 41%. There '
            'will now be political debate about whether this meets the 1.5 '
            'target.” Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Inc spokesperson, James '
            'Every-Palmer QC, said that while the target sounded good and is a '
            'significant improvement on the current NDC, it is not as good as '
            'it sounds. “The climate does not care about our clever accounting '
            'choices, it cares about the level of net emissions. And our '
            'failure to walk-the-talk will be apparent to our trading partners '
            'in our United Nations framework convention on climate change '
            'reporting.” The climate minister James Shaw said while the first '
            'priority was to reduce emissions domestically, the country will '
            'also boost its emissions reductions through buying overseas '
            'carbon credits. “We will then add to this by working to reduce '
            'emissions in other parts of the world. The priority here will be '
            'to support developing countries in the Asia-Pacific to meet their '
            'sustainable development goals. But Professor Ralph Sims, from '
            'Massey University said: “forest sinks only buy us time, and '
            'buying international credits is yet to be agreed under Paris COP '
            'rules and remains questionable with double-counting a risk”. '
            'Forest and Bird’s chief executive Kevin Hague said the government '
            'was relying too heavily on other countries to do the work. '
            '“Unless the government delivers a much better plan to cut '
            'emissions that what we have seen so far this target will be '
            'mostly met by buying carbon credits from other countries. That’s '
            'a government subsidy to polluters like the dairy industry.” With '
            'the target set, and the country’s emissions reduction plan due in '
            'May 2022, the most important thing now was for action to back up '
            'the ambitions, Hayward said. “It’s meeting them that is the big '
            'challenge as we work to make these cuts to our emissions real in '
            'all sectors of the economy, and to dramatically increase our '
            'efforts to protect people and businesses from increasingly '
            'chaotic climate futures.”',

{'article': 'If you grew up in an Indigenous community, you would have heard '
            'someone say, “they’re out today, aren’t they?” And you would ask, '
            'who? And they would reply, “the cops.” You would have this '

            'system at a higher rate than non-Indigenous people? Does policing '
            'Indigenous communities work?\n'
            'The New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research '
            '(2016) tells us that between 2001 and 2015, the number of '
            'Indigenous people in NSW prisons doubled. The rise was a result '
            'of higher rates of arrest resulting in conviction, a greater '
            'likelihood of being sent to prison given the conviction, and a '
            'higher rate of being refused bail, the research found. If all '
            'these people are being arrested and sent to prison, why are our '
            'communities still over-policed, and why has nothing in our '
            'communities changed? Why are crimes still being committed? It’s '
            'simple: police patrols do not reduce crime. Controlled trials in '
            'the US have found that while police patrols are effective at '
            'improving the image of the local police force, they are not '
            'effective at reducing crime. Moreover, hotspot policing has been '
            'shown to have adverse effects on communities. When an area is '
            'over-policed, it becomes stigmatised and associated with '
            'delinquency. We do not need to be told that our people are '
            'committing crimes in our community – we live there, we know who '
            'are committing these crimes. They are our sons, daughters, '
            'cousins, uncles, aunties, and we still love them. Police officers '
            'may arrest the ones we love, but it does not solve the underlying '
            'cause of why crime is committed, which is poverty. Wherever there '
            'is poverty, there are high property and petty crime rates. These '
            'crimes are committed out of necessity, not malice intent. For '
            '60,000 years, we had our own set of laws and punishments. Still, '
            'in the last 200 years, we have had a legal system imposed on to '
            'us from the other side of the world. The results have been '
            'catastrophic. Indigenous adults are 12.5 times more likely to be '
            'incarcerated, Indigenous children are 26 times more likely to be '
            'incarcerated, Indigenous women are becoming the fastest-growing '
            'prison population in Australia, and more than 470 Aboriginal and '
            'Torres Strait Islander peoples have died in custody. What is the '
            'answer? Indigenous communities are aware of the complexity '
            'associated with crime. The perspective of our people should be '
            'considered when our Mob are sent to stand before the judge. Our '
            'communities must also be permitted to identify critical issues '
            'and implement culturally informed solutions that will keep '
            'Indigenous people out of jail and be a part of our community '
            'without the stigmatisation of having been sent to prison.\n'
            'So does deploying police officers in our communities work? The '
            'answer is no. It does not combat poverty; it just results in '
            'overrepresentation, incarceration and death. There is so much to '
            'be proud of in our communities, such as kinship, culture, being '
            'able to pop around to anyone’s house for a cuppa tea. But this '

            'I’ve had white friends tell me they’re not allowed to travel to '
            '“that” part of town because that’s where all the crime happens. '
            'This is just blatantly false and racist. Crime can and does '
            'happen in every community, from North Sydney to Moree. Still, it '

            'to get a “private phone” and use the Chinese instant messaging '
            'app WeChat in the days after he was first summonsed to appear '
            'before the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog because, he '
            'told her “they can read texts”. But Berejiklian denied that the '
            'request made her suspect Maguire may have been involved in any '
            'corrupt conduct, telling the Independent Commission Against '
            'Corruption that it was “normal human nature” not to want “your '
            'private conversations being listened to”. On the final day of '
            'Icac’s public hearings into her conduct, Berejiklian was grilled '
            'by counsel assisting the commission, Scott Robertson, on her '
            'actions in the days after Maguire first revealed to her that the '
            'watchdog had called him to appear as a witness in a separate '
            'investigation.\n'
            'Icac previously heard that on 5 July 2018 Maguire told '
            'Berejiklian he had been summonsed to appear before Icac during a '
            '52-minute conversation. During the conversation, played before '
            'Icac on Friday, Berejiklian asked repeated questions about the '
            'nature of Maguire’s involvement in the probe, and described some '
            'developers involved in that separate investigation as “dodgy”. '
            'When Maguire raised the prospect that their phone calls might be '
            'tapped, she asked: “is that going to be a problem?” A key plank '
            'of Icac’s investigation is whether Berejiklian breached the '
            'state’s Icac Act by failing to report conduct by Maguire she had '
            'reason to suspect on “reasonable grounds” may have been corrupt. '
            'She has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and on Friday told Icac '
            'the phone call did not raise suspicions because “he told me he’d '
            'done nothing wrong and I believed him”. On Monday, Robertson took '
            'Berejiklian to the days between the 5 July phone call and '
            'Maguire’s appearance before Icac eight days later. He revealed '
            'that four days later, on 9 July, Maguire sent a text to '
            'Berejiklian instructing her to download the Chinese messaging app '
            'WeChat, telling her: “you need to get a private phone”. “They can '
            'read texts but not the little green man, leaves no trace,” he '
            'wrote, in an apparent reference to the green WeChat icon. In '
            'another message, Maguire told the then premier that he had “got '
            'more info and data than them”, using an emoji that Robertson '
            'described as a “beaming face with smiling eyes”. Berejiklian '
            'again denied that the text messages raised concerns with her, '
            'saying it was common for MPs to have “two phones” and that she '
            'believed Maguire was concerned about “privacy”. She said she had '
            'not acted on his suggestion to get a private phone. Questioned on '
            'whether she thought it was “curious” that in the days after '
            'telling her he had been summonsed to appear before Icac, Maguire '
            'wanted her to get a private phone, Berejiklian said that was '
            '“certainly not my recollection”. “I wouldn’t have taken it as any '
            'more than privacy issues,” she told Robertson. “I was very '
            'confident that he didn’t do anything wrong. And I was certainly '
            'confident that I hadn’t done anything wrong.” After Maguire '
            'appeared before Icac on 13 July 2018, he was forced to move to '
            'the crossbench, eventually resigning after the watchdog revealed '
            'he had discussed the possibility of earning commissions on the '
            'sale of development sites which he wanted to help broker. Icac '
            'made no corruption findings in relation to Maguire but '
            'recommended he face charges for allegedly giving false evidence.\n'
            'Following his evidence, Berejiklian released a statement saying '
            'the MP had “let down” his constituents and urging him to consider '
            'stepping down from the parliament. She told Icac that she was '
            '“mortified” after he gave evidence, saying the “shock of what '
            'happened made me question everything” including whether Maguire '
            'might have lied to her. But under questioning from Robertson, '
            'Berejiklian again denied his evidence meant that she suspected he '
            'may have engaged in corrupt conduct, saying only that there was a '
            '“cloud” around him and that she did not “join the dots” with '
            'information he had previously given her about hoping to make '
            '$1.5m from a Badgerys Creek land deal. “The question I asked '
            'myself was did I know anything [and] the answer very strongly in '
            'my mind is that I didn’t know anything about what this commission '
            'was looking at,” she said. Pressed on why she did not at least '
            'report the 5 July phone call she said: “I had nothing to report. '
            'There was nothing that I knew, nothing that I remembered, nothing '
            'that I thought was of any relevance.” Monday marked the final day '
            'of Icac’s public hearings into Berejiklian’s conduct, which has '
            'been centred on her role in the awarding of two grants which '
            'Maguire had lobbied for as an MP: $5.5m for a shooting range and '
            'conference centre in 2017, and $30m for a conservatorium of '
            'music, both in his seat of Wagga Wagga. ICAC is investigating '
            'whether she “breached the public trust” by failing to declare her '
            'relationship with Maguire. She has denied any wrongdoing.” Icac '
            'has previously heard evidence Maguire and Berejiklian remained in '
            'contact following his resignation in July, including a phone call '
            'in which she told him that she would “throw money” at his seat '
            'during the by-election prompted by his resignation. In a series '
            'of recordings taken from tapped phone conversations between the '
            'couple, Berejiklian told Maguire that funding for one of two '
            'grants at the centre of the probe was a “done deal” after he '
            'complained about “roadblocks” on his “money projects”. “I know '
            'but you’re still getting everything. We ticked off your '
            'conservatorium the other day, that’s a done deal now,” '
            'Berejiklian told Maguire about a grant to fund the relocation of '

            'decision to give $20m to fund the second stage of the project '
            'despite some within her office and the public service not '
            'supporting it. Berejiklian told Icac it was a “high-level, '
            'strategic” decision to fund the project, based on her belief that '
            'it enjoyed a lot of community support. “It’s not uncommon during '

            'my role in public life,” she said. “I don’t want to say too much '
            'more than that at this stage, just to say, obviously, what’s '
            'occurred to me is a difficult situation but I know many people do '
            'it tough in the community. “And now I intend to get on with my '

{'article': 'Japan’s ruling conservative party defied expectations in Sunday’s '
            'general election, with a comfortable victory that will boost the '
            'prime minister, Fumio Kishida, as he attempts to steer the '
            'economy out of the coronavirus pandemic. Kishida’s Liberal '
            'Democratic party secured 261 seats in the 465-member lower house '
            '– the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber Diet – slightly down '
            'on its pre-election 276 seats. The party and its junior coalition '
            'partner, Komeito, together won 293 seats, more than the 261 '
            'required for an “absolute stable majority” that gives them '
            'command of parliamentary committees, making it easier to pass '
            'bills.\n'
            'Japan’s Nikkei share index rose 2.3% on Monday to a one-month '
            'high.\n'
            'Kishida said his administration would attempt to compile an extra '
            'budget this year that would support for people hit by the '
            'pandemic, including those who lost their jobs and students '
            'struggling to pay tuition fees. “The lower house election is '
            'about choosing a leadership,” Kishida told public broadcaster '
            'NHK. “With the ruling coalition certain to keep its majority, I '
            'believe we received a mandate from the voters.” The '
            'Constitutional Democratic party of Japan, the biggest opposition '
            'group, lost more than a dozen seats. But the rightwing populist '
            'Japan Innovation party, whose base is in the western city of '
            'Osaka, quadrupled its presence to 41 seats to become the '
            'third-biggest party in the chamber. Some exit polls had predicted '
            'an uncomfortably close night for Kishida and the LDP, which has '
            'governed Japan almost without interruption since the mid-1950s '
            'and last lost a lower house election in 2009.\n'
            'Kishida, who became prime minister last month after his '
            'predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, decided not to run in the LDP '
            'leadership race, said he would prepare Japan’s health service for '
            'a possible wave of winter Covid-19 cases and tackle income '
            'inequality as he attempts to revive the pandemic-hit economy with '
            'a multi-trillion yen stimulus package. “The overall trend is in '
            'favour of stability. The LDP cleared the hurdles it absolutely '
            'had to,” said Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for '
            'American Progress. “We’ll see a lot of stimulus.” Kishida, 64, '
            'had hoped that his focus on a vaguely defined “new capitalism” '
            'that would redistribute wealth to Japan’s struggling middle '
            'classes would help his party retain its healthy majority in '
            'parliament. He had also promised a more responsive leadership '
            'amid criticism that Shinzo Abe, who stepped down last year, and '
            'his short-lived successor, Suga, had lost touch with voters, '
            'particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Voter apathy was '
            'reflected in the turnout, which at just under 56% was the third '
            'lowest since the end of the war.\n'
            'Unusually for an incoming leader, Kishida did not enjoy a '
            'political honeymoon, with approval ratings about 50%, the lowest '
            'in two decades for a new administration in Japan. Several '
            'opposition parties had attempted to capitalise on unusually close '
            'cooperation, with five of them, including the communists, '
            'agreeing before the campaign not to compete against each other in '
            'marginal constituencies in an attempt to consolidate the anti-LDP '
            'vote. They called for more help for low-income families, as well '
            'as to allow married couples to use separate surnames and for the '
            'legalisation of same-sex marriage – two changes Kishida has said '
            'he opposes. “I focused on the candidates’ policies on same-sex '
            'marriage and LGBT issues. I have many friends in gay or lesbian '
            'couples. I hope public understanding on these issues will '
            'deepen,” said Eko Nagasaki, an 18-year-old woman who voted for '
            'the first time. Several polls had indicated that Kishida, a '
            'softly spoke centrist whose rise had been met with indifference '
            'by many voters, lacked the profile to lead the LDP to a '
            'convincing victory. Last month he defeated three rivals to become '
            'party president – effectively securing him the premiership – '
            'including Taro Kono, a reformist whose popularity among voters '
            'was not shared by many party MPs. Kishida, who had delayed a '
            'decision on his attendance at Cop26 summit until the election '
            'results were in, will now come under pressure to offer more '
            'details of his plans for the world’s third-biggest economy, as '
            'well as ensure that Japan’s medical infrastructure is better able '
            'to cope with a possible rise in Covid-19 cases. On the foreign '
            'policy front, he backs party plans to dramatically raise defence '
            'spending in response to an increasingly uncertain security '
            'environment in north-east Asia. The LDP included in its election '
            'platform a pledge to double defence spending to 2% of GDP, citing '
            'rising tensions between China and Taiwan and North Korea’s '
            'resumption of ballistic missile tests. Japan, whose postwar '
            '“pacifist” constitution forbids it from using force to settle '
            'international disputes, has traditionally kept spending on '
            'defence to within 1% of GDP. Any attempt to break through that '
            'symbolic barrier could encounter resistance at home and spark '
            'protests from China. Yoshihiko Suzuki, who voted for opposition '
            'candidates, said he hoped Kishida’s win would bring an end to the '
            '“arrogance and complacency” that had characterised his '
            'predecessors’ administrations. “I hope this election comes as a '
            'wakeup call for them,” the retired 68-year-old said. “If it does, '
            'the LDP will become a better party, considering the number of '
            'talented lawmakers they’ve got.”',

{'article': 'After much Sturm und Drang, Australia’s prime minister Scott '
            'Morrison has finally jetted off to attend the global climate '
            'talks in Glasgow with a vague and hastily assembled commitment to '
            'net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The growing international '
            'pressure and voter concerns over the devastating climate impacts '
            'Australia has endured in recent years appear to have finally '
            'dragged the government kicking and screaming to this position, '
            'despite a rearguard action by the government’s Coalition '
            'partners, the National party, against any such commitment. '
            'However, last week Morrison triumphantly waved a pamphlet '
            'proclaiming his government’s commitment to net zero under the '
            'banner of the “Australian Way”.\n'
            'Long on promises and short on details, the government’s '
            'commitment relies upon the viability of dubious future '
            'technologies, most notably carbon capture at massive scale, '
            'rather than any mandated reduction in emissions, let alone a '
            'price or tax on emitted carbon. As Morrison said: “Our plan works '
            'with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it '
            'doesn’t legislate them, it doesn’t mandate them.” While business '
            'groups, including those representing the country’s coal industry '
            'like the Minerals Council of Australia, praised the announcement '
            'as providing certainty, overseas observers have noted this '
            'commitment is the weakest among developed nations attending the '
            'Glasgow talks, and lacks any change to the government’s existing '
            'emissions reductions targets of 26% to 28% by 2030 (half what '
            'other industrialised nations such as the US, the UK and the '
            'European Union have committed to). Indeed, recent analysis '
            'suggests Australia is at the back of the pack among developed '
            'nations in terms of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions and '
            'transitioning away from fossil fuels. While this commitment, even '
            'if reluctant, to net zero emissions by 2050 is to be welcomed, in '
            'reality it needs to be seen within the broader context of the '
            'Australian government’s continued coddling of the fossil fuel '
            'industry. Australia is among the world’s largest fossil fuel '
            'exporters (ranking just behind Russia and Saudi Arabia) and the '
            'largest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and '
            'Development, making up 7% of global fossil fuel exports. After '
            'decades of government-sponsored expansion, Australia’s coal and '
            'gas industries make the country the fifth-largest miner of fossil '
            'fuel carbon in absolute terms (larger than India, Indonesia, '
            'Canada, Iraq and Iran). Added to that, domestic emissions are '
            'significant, ranking 14th globally, and on a per capita basis the '
            'highest in the OECD.\n'
            'This fossil fuel addiction stems from the close support by '
            'government of the industry over decades, with considerable '
            'assistance from the Murdoch media empire, who have presented '
            'fossil fuel extraction and use as inherent to Australia’s '
            'national identity and economic wellbeing. While growing concerns '
            'over climate change have prompted attempts at policy reform (most '
            'notably the former Gillard Labor government’s introduction of '
            'carbon pricing legislation a decade ago), these moves have been '
            'strenuously opposed by the Coalition and the mining industry.\n'
            'However, as outright denial of climate change becomes untenable '
            'in the face of record-breaking droughts, fires, and floods, '
            'industry and its abettors in government and the conservative '
            'media have engaged in what one of us has termed the new climate '
            'war. This war on climate action involves an array of tactics that '
            'fall short of outright denial, but are nonetheless aimed at '
            'blocking, or at least slowing, the transition of fossil fuels. In '
            'Australia, a chief tactic of the forces of climate inaction has '
            'been to call for a “measured response” which in no way constrains '
            'fossil fuel expansion. If Australia were to limit its coal '
            'exports, the inactivists argue, buyers would source coal from '
            'elsewhere (a variation of the “drug-dealer’s defence”). Or they '
            'assert that Australian coal helps bring developing nations out of '
            '“energy poverty” (a tagline developed by US coal giant Peabody '
            'Energy and promoted by climate inactivists). Coal is “good for '
            'humanity” they insist. Indeed, Morrison in a previous incarnation '
            'as the country’s treasurer in the hot summer of 2017 famously '
            'waved a lump of coal at opposition politicians on the floor of '
            'parliament, declaring: “This is coal … don’t be afraid!” Well, we '
            'should have been afraid. Very afraid. After all, look who is now '
            'prime minister.\n'
            'Given the Coalition’s history of defending the dominance of '
            'fossil energy in Australia, what are we to make of their belated '
            'acceptance of the net zero agenda? Overall, it appears the song '
            'remains the same! The failure to commit to increased emissions '
            'reduction targets, as well as the recent disclosures that the '
            'Australian government has sought to water down a UN '
            'recommendation to phase out coal- and gas-fired power stations, '
            'and rejected a call to join a US and European-led pledge to cut '
            'methane emissions, and that the country’s energy minister will be '
            'spruiking the benefits of Australian gas investment at the '
            'Glasgow talks, all seem par for the course. While Morrison has '
            'swapped the lump of coal for a flashy pamphlet, there appears '
            'little substance to the government’s purported commitment to '
            'climate action. Like other nations and companies committed to a '
            'continuation of business-as-usual fossil fuel extraction and use, '
            'it appears the name of the game is delay and inaction. '
            'Unfortunately, the time for delay is well past and the window to '
            'avoid catastrophic climate disruption is rapidly closing. We '
            'can’t afford further inaction and obfuscation by the current '

{'article': 'It wasn’t clear that Emmanuel Macron would stop when encircled by '
            'a small party of Australian journalists after he had finished his '
            'press conference at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Rome. His '
            'minders clearly wanted their waylaid boss to keep on walking. But '
            'the French president chose to stop and entertain questions. '
            'Having been invited politely to reflect on the nuclear submarine '
            'fracas, Macron took aim at Scott Morrison, and he did not miss.\n'
            'Morrison has been shadowed by the Aukus controversy ever since '
            'his departure from Australia last Thursday. Macron’s opening '
            'submarine sortie came in a phone call just before the prime '
            'minister boarded his plane for the G20. Diplomatic relations '
            'between Canberra and Paris have been in the deep freeze since '
            'Morrison dumped the $90bn contract with the French Naval Group, '
            'and whipped Aukus out of his back pocket. Facing the prospect of '
            'having to front two international summits with Macron, where any '
            'obvious snub would grab headlines, Morrison attempted to repair '
            'the relationship by reaching out to the Élysée Palace. Macron '
            'consented to a phone call. During the call last Thursday, Macron '
            'told Morrison that ditching the submarine contract had broken '
            '“the relationship of trust”. Canberra needed to propose “tangible '
            'actions” to heal the rift. Macron also hoped Morrison had packed '
            'lashings of ambition before arriving at the G20 and the Cop26 in '
            'Glasgow. Australia, he said, needed “to cease production and '
            'consumption of coal at the national level and abroad”. We know '
            'all this because Macron got his official record of the '
            'conversation out first. In the time-honoured diplomatic game of '
            'duelling readouts, first movers always establish the terms of any '
            'ensuing narrative.\n'
            'Macron’s version was splashed prominently across Australian news '
            'outlets while Morrison was winging his way slowly north. '
            'Journalists travelling on the plane with Morrison were not given '
            'a heads-up. We found out when the news of the call broke. The '
            'tenor of the call established that any rapprochement between '
            'Paris and Canberra would be gritted teeth at best. By the time '
            'Morrison touched down in Rome, the “optics” got worse. On the '
            'evening before the G20, Joe Biden (another one of the Aukus '
            'traitors) embarked on his own performative rapprochement with '
            'Macron. During a tête-à-tête at France’s Vatican embassy in Rome, '
            'Biden acknowledged the handling of the submarine fracas had been '
            '“clumsy”. Biden wasn’t done. He told his French counterpart he’d '
            'been “under the impression” that France had been informed long '
            'before Aukus (surprise!) day that the contract was going to be '
            'terminated. It was possible Biden was rebuking his own senior '
            'staff. Morrison insists the Biden administration was kept '
            'informed of all the twists and turns in Australia’s long '
            'conversation with France about the troubled Naval Group contract '
            'while the secret Aukus planning was under way. The Canberra '
            'version of this story is senior White House aides failed to '
            'manage up. But it was also possible Biden had just landed a very '
            'public blow on Morrison. With Angela Merkel, the political titan '
            'of Europe, bowing out of public life, Macron is very important to '
            'Biden. If Macron wanted a scalp to restore dented French national '
            'pride perhaps it better be that “fellow from down under”. Thank '
            'you very much pal. Being berated in Rome wasn’t on Morrison’s G20 '
            'plan. The plan was to raise the alarm about people being nasty on '
            'Facebook, and block any inconvenient language presaging a '
            'phase-out of coal in the final communique. But instead of Roman '
            'Holiday, Morrison found himself on the receiving end of a Malachi '
            'Crunch from Biden and Macron. Things got even worse on Sunday '
            'night when Macron accused Morrison of lying during his impromptu '
            'chat with Australian journalists – an extraordinary charge in '
            'diplomatic terms. The obvious question to ask – is Macron’s lying '
            'charge fair? Morrison was ropable when he learned of the '
            'accusation. He says he didn’t lie. Morrison says he gave Macron a '
            'significant hint in June that the contract was in strife. The '
            'prime minister says he wasn’t in a position to be any more candid '
            'because the Aukus pact needed to be secret squirrel right up '
            'until the time Biden, Boris Johnson and Morrison decided to fess '
            'up. This rings true. There aren’t many countries in the world '
            'that would dare pre-empt an American national security '
            'announcement if the US expressly forbade its disclosure. Morrison '
            'was in a difficult position. But it’s fair to say Morrison put '
            'himself in a difficult position by choosing to pursue US '
            'nuclear-powered submarines while still contracted to a French '
            'alternative. Aukus wasn’t foisted on him. He wasn’t a victim. '
            'This was an opportunity Morrison hunted down for Australia. '
            'Another question to ask, apart from what on earth Morrison can do '
            'to make things right, is how this fracas reads domestically. '
            'Morrison is very obviously trying to insulate himself from '
            'reputational damage by declaring he has prioritised Australia’s '
            'national security ahead of French national pride. If France must '
            'be humiliated in the process of keeping Australians safe – then '
            'bring on the humiliation. Who is that uppity Macron to poke an '
            'Australian prime minister in the chest? Nationalist parables like '
            'this one write themselves. Morrison clearly believes he has a '
            'viable means of discounting Macron’s very undiplomatic attack on '
            'his character and integrity, and perhaps that will work. But the '
            'risk for Morrison is Macron’s precision demolition plays right '
            'into pre-existing voter unease that Australia’s prime minister '
            'doesn’t always play it straight, and very rarely cops it sweet.',

            'of the passengers who were onboard the first flights from '
            'Singapore and Los Angeles walked into the arrivals terminal '
            'shortly after 6am on Monday morning to be greeted by emotional '
            'family members and loved ones.\n'
            'Returning Australians were handed Tim Tams and hakea pincushion '
            'flowers as they made their way through a crowd of reporters. '
            '“I’ve got to get to my daughter, I’ve got to hold her,” one woman '
            'said as she pushed through the throng to embrace her daughter. '
            'Carlie Boyd was one of the first Australians to push a trolley of '
            'suitcases into the arrivals hall – clearing the heavily '
            'sterilised customs area at 6.28am and breathing in the crisp '
            'Sydney morning air for the first time in more than three years. '
            'Boyd’s brother Ryan Boyd and sister Clare Lyons had arrived at '
            'the airport before 6am with a balloon and sign to welcome her, '
            'and raced to hug her. “It’s been pretty stressful, so just to be '
            'able to come home without having to go quarantine is huge,” Boyd '
            'said.\n'
            'She had been living in New York, and after being unable to secure '
            'a flight home during the months of quarantine arrival caps, '
            'bought her Qantas ticket to Sydney three days ago. She and her '
            'siblings planned to surprise their parents at their Blue '
            'Mountains family home. “There were a lot of people on that flight '
            'who have loved ones who are about to die or had people who died '
            'this week, so for them to be able to get off the plane and go and '
            'see them straight away is pretty amazing,” Boyd said.\n'
            'Other passengers Guardian Australia spoke to said there were only '
            'about 70 people on the first Qantas flight, and that many were '
            'visiting dying loved ones. When Ethan Carter walked into the '
            'arrivals hall and on to Australian soil for the first time in two '
            'years, he had only one thing on his mind. His mother, Joy. “I’m '
            'anxious and excited and can’t wait to see her.”\n'
            'Carter, who lives in Chicago, said he was desperate to see his '
            'mother, who has fallen ill and been moved into permanent care. '
            '“She’s in WA, so I don’t want to talk about their laws … I might '
            'not ever be let in,” he said. “I’m really scared and emotional '
            'because I really want to see my mum.” He choked up as he added: '
            '“The doctor said that she hasn’t got long.” He then approached '
            'border officials to discuss how he could fly to Perth to '
            'quarantine before visiting his mother. He also issued a plea to '
            'the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan: “Mark, think of the '
            'people that are suffering mentally to see their family, that’s '
            'also a health issue … You’ve got to bring families together '
            'again, you have to – everybody needs to be together, it’s so '
            'important. “We respect that you’re trying to be safe, but '
            'everyone needs to be together, please.” Elsewhere in the arrivals '
            'halls, some were meeting new family members for the first time. '
            'Moments after her son Robert walked out of the customs hall with '
            'his partner, Ivan, and daughter, Pia, Deb d’Apice picked up her '
            'two-year-old granddaughter, held her up to her face, and stared '

            'that also came into effect on Monday. After hearing that '

            'sites. “It’s fucking exciting,” Forrest said. “It’s going to be a '
            'spiritual experience.” Olive said she was most excited to sample '
            'the food in Mexico.\n'

            'moving to for a job that Miad organised more than a year ago but '
            'for which they had been unable to secure exit approvals. “To be '
            'honest, we’re sad to be leaving Australia, but after the lockdown '
            'it’s very exciting to start anew,” Miad said. The Pagewood couple '
            'have family overseas, and hope to be able to visit them more '

            'again.”\n'
            'The experience of dropping someone off at departures felt strange '

            'England as the NHS aims to increase vaccine uptake before what is '
            'expected to be a challenging winter. From Monday, anyone in an '
            'eligible group who had their second dose of a coronavirus vaccine '
            'at least six months ago can turn up at one of hundreds of sites '
            'to get their top-up without making an appointment. The walk-in '
            'centres are also offering vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds. '
            'The move follows criticism of the booster campaign, with only '
            'about half of the 12 million people in England eligible so far '
            'for a third vaccine dose having received one. The vaccine rollout '
            'to teenagers has lagged behind that of countries including '
            'France, Italy and Spain. People entitled to a booster jab are: '
            'those aged 50 and over, people who live and work in care homes; '
            'frontline health and social care workers; people aged 16 and over '
            'with a health condition that puts them at high risk of getting '
            'seriously ill from Covid-19; those aged 16 and over who are a '
            'main carer for someone at high risk from the virus, and; people '
            'aged 16 and over who live with someone who is more likely to get '
            'infections. Nikki Kanani, a GP and the deputy lead for the NHS '
            'Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: “NHS staff are making it as '
            'easy as possible for people to get their top-up vaccination, and '
            'from today people can now go online, find their nearest site and '
            'go and get their booster without delay. “The booster is not just '
            'nice to have. It is really important protection ahead of what we '
            'know will be a challenging winter.” People are advised to use the '
            'NHS online walk-in finder to check where their nearest centre is '
            'and whether it is offering boosters, and vaccines for 12- to '
            '15-year-olds. NHS England said almost everyone registered with a '
            'GP practice lives within 10 miles of a fixed vaccination site. On '
            'Friday clinical guidelines were amended to allow care home '
            'residents and some vulnerable people to get their Covid booster '
            'vaccine a month early, in an effort to boost immunity during the '
            'winter. The booster campaign is a central part of the '
            'government’s strategy for limiting hospital admissions because '
            'immunity from the initial two doses wanes over time, particularly '
            'in older adults and at-risk groups. Protection against '
            'symptomatic illness falls from 65% up to three months after the '
            'second dose to 45% six months after the second dose for the '
            'Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and from 90% to 65% for the '
            'Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to the latest evidence from '
            'the government’s scientific advisers. Protection against '
            'hospitalisation is estimated to fall from 95% to 75% for '
            'Oxford/AstraZeneca and from 99% to 90% for Pfizer/BioNTech. On '
            'Sunday a further 38,009 people were reported as testing positive '

{'article': 'It has been criticised for trotting out cliches about France and '
            'the French and mocked for its idealised portrayal of Paris. But '
            'now the Netflix show Emily in Paris will focus on diversity and '

            'Collins. The actor, who stars as Emily and is also a producer on '

            'which first hit our screens last year, and efforts had been made '
            'to address them.\n'
            'In an interview with Elle UK, for its December issue, Collins '
            'said: “For me as Emily, but also as a producer on [the show], '
            'after season one, hearing people’s thoughts, concerns, questions, '
            'likes, dislikes, just feelings about it, there were certain '
            'things that spoke to the time that we’re living in and what is '
            'right, and moral and correct and should be done. “And I really '
            'wanted diversity and inclusion in front of and behind the camera '
            'to be something that we really put our focus on, in a lot of '
            'ways. Hiring new people in front of the camera, also giving new '
            'storylines to different characters, which was really important.” '
            'Created by Darren Star, who is best known for Sex and the City, '
            'Emily in Paris tells the story of Emily Cooper, played by '
            'Collins, an ambitious American marketing executive who lands her '
            'dream job in the French capital. And while the series has been a '
            'hit for Netflix, it did not find favour among the French when it '
            'premiered in October last year. The French news outlet 20 Minutes '
            'opined: “The berets. The croissants. The baguettes. The hostile '
            'waiters. The irascible concierges. The inveterate philanderers. '
            'The lovers and the mistresses. Name a cliche about France and the '
            'French, you’ll find it in Emily in Paris.” Charles Martin, critic '
            'for Première, was equally irritated. “Frankly, watching Emily in '
            'Paris there’s plenty to feel insulted about,” he wrote. “When '
            'they decided to caricature us, the authors didn’t hold back.” RTL '
            'radio added that in between “the berets, the cocktail dresses and '
            'the invariably spotless streets, Parisians will not find it easy '
            'to recognise their daily lives”. Filming for the second series, '
            'which took place during the pandemic, meant the French capital '
            'was “very empty”, said Collins, who is the daughter of '
            'singer-songwriter Phil Collins. “There weren’t any Americans '
            'around because they weren’t allowed,” she said. “So that felt '
            'even more strange, because the only accents you would hear were '
            'French – which was also really lovely.” Discussing her father, '
            'Collins, 32, added: “Starting out, when I was younger, I had lots '
            'of things taken out of context in interviews. “I couldn’t be a '
            'more proud daughter, a more loving daughter. I love him and I am '
            'in awe and I respect him and I’m inspired by him. “But as an '
            'individual, I’ve always wanted to be me, and to have my own path '
            'and my own journey and my own failures and successes and all '
            'those things, like any individual wants.” The second series of '

{'article': 'The prime minister should no longer be the only person who can '
            'give permission for ethics investigations into his own conduct '

            'the ministerial code of conduct, which is overseen by the prime '

            'after Boris Johnson’s previous adviser on ministers’ interests, '
            'Sir Alex Allan, resigned after a report into the conduct of Priti '

            'the PM had full confidence in her and considered the matter '
            '“closed”. Since then, Johnson has appointed a new adviser, '

            'task was investigating the controversial Downing Street '
            'refurbishment that involved Johnson borrowing money from a Tory '
            'donor via the Conservative party. Lord Geidt concluded that '
            'Johnson had acted in an “unwise” manner without having breached '
            'the rules. At the moment, the PM is the only person with the '
            'power to order investigations into the conduct of ministers, '
            'including himself, and is the one to appoint the independent '
            'adviser who carries out investigations. However, the committee on '
            'standards in public life said the independent adviser on '
            'ministerial interests should instead be appointed by a panel made '
            'up predominantly of independent members. It also recommended that '
            'the adviser should be able to initiate their own investigations, '
            'have the authority to determine breaches of the code and see '
            'their report published within eight weeks of submission to the '
            'PM. On the ministerial code itself, the report said it needed to '
            'have a constitutional footing laid down in law, with any '
            'revisions subject to advice from the independent adviser, and '
            'possible sanctions for breaches should be set out including '
            'apologies, fines and asking for a minister’s resignation. The '
            'committee also recommended a strengthening of the advisory '
            'committee on business appointments (Acoba), which governs the '
            'revolving door between government and the private sector by '
            'advising on lobbying and jobs taken on by former ministers and '
            'officials. It said the current ban on officials and ministers '
            'lobbying for two years after leaving their post should be able to '
            'be extended to up to five years, and any work for a lobbying firm '
            'should be included in the ban, rather than just a prohibition on '
            'direct lobbying. “The lack of any meaningful sanctions for a '
            'breach of the rules is no longer sustainable,” the report said, '
            'suggesting injunctions against lobbying work could be sought or '
            'means of recouping severance or pension payments. Thirdly, it '
            'said there needed to be further reforms to the powers of the '
            'commissioner for public appointments, which oversees jobs for top '
            'civil servants and at public bodies, to make sure appointment '
            'panels are independent. Evans, a former director general of MI5, '
            'said the committee had concluded that the “current system of '
            'standards regulation is overly dependent on convention”. The '
            'recommendations were necessary to “restore public confidence in '
            'the regulation of ethical standards in government”, he added. In '
            'response, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union for '
            'senior civil servants, said the recommendation that the '
            'independent adviser should be able to initiate investigations was '
            '“essential if the code is to have a meaningful independent '
            'function”. “There can be no hiding from the fact that the current '
            'prime minister has undermined confidence in the ministerial code '
            'as a meaningful regulator of ministerial conduct,” Penman said. '
            'The recommendations were endorsed by Sir John Major, the former '
            'Tory prime minister who first set up the committee. In a '
            'foreword, Major said the committee “makes many important '
            'recommendations that I hope will be approved by the government – '
            'and, where necessary, parliament – and then implemented”. Angela '
            'Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said her party welcomed the '
            'report, and many of its recommendations had previously been '
            'called for by Labour. “Boris Johnson and his Conservative '
            'colleagues’ actions have repeatedly undermined standards in our '
            'public life,” she said. “The system that is supposed to uphold '
            'the ministerial code, lobbying rules, business appointments, '
            'public appointments and transparency is clearly unfit for '
            'purpose. “Ministers have disregarded the rules and it is about '
            'time for a radical overhaul of the system.”',

{'article': 'Relations between the EU and the UK risk further deterioration '
            'after the Brexit minister accused Brussels of behaving “without '
            'regard to the huge political, economic and identity '
            'sensitivities” in Northern Ireland. David Frost said the bloc had '
            '“destroyed cross-community consent” with an “overly strict” '
            'enforcement of the arrangements hammered out in the withdrawal '
            'agreement of January 2020.\n'
            'His comments, in a foreword to a new paper for the Policy '
            'Exchange thinktank, were published days after a second week of '
            'talks between both sides ended in deadlock. He also articulated, '
            'in the plainest terms yet, a view held in Downing Street that the '
            'protocol’s terms were foisted upon Britain owing to the weakness '
            'of Theresa May in the first phase of negotiations in 2017. Lord '
            'Frost said the EU-UK joint report, which set the terms for the '
            'article 50 process of divorce from the EU, was a result of the UK '
            'failing to make “the necessary mental shift from being a member '
            'of the EU to negotiating exit from the EU”. The joint report was '
            'a landmark moment in the history of Brexit, marked by the '
            'humiliation of May by Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist '
            'party in December 2017 just as she was about to co-sign it with '
            'the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The '
            'then-DUP leader Arlene Foster, who was propping up May’s '
            'government, told her she would not support clauses which meant '
            'Northern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the '
            'republic if the border problem could not be solved in second '
            'phase of negotiations. Days later the section of the joint report '
            'was changed to accommodate the DUP but the sequencing of Brexit '
            'was set in stone, putting the Irish border solutions into the '
            'legally binding withdrawal agreement – Dublin’s point of maximum '
            'leverage – rather than future trade relations. The faultlines '
            'generated by the sequencing appear to be driving Frost’s demands '
            'for fundamental changes to the protocol. He says he considered '
            'resigning from his role as foreign affairs special adviser to '
            'Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, after reading the terms of '
            'the joint report and realising “a crucial pass had been sold”. '
            'Frost said the protocol agreed that December was a result of the '
            '“extreme weakness” of the UK government after the June 2017 '
            'election. “We must return to the protocol and deliver a more '
            'robust, and more balanced, outcome than we could in 2019.” The '
            'Policy Exchange paper – The Northern Ireland Protocol: the '
            'origins of the current crisis, by Roderick Crawford – provides a '
            'chronology of Brexit negotiations and what went wrong in 2017. It '
            'argues that commitments, particularly on the Irish border, in the '
            'joint report were “a diplomatic triumph for Ireland and the '
            'Commission” but that “failing to secure adequate reciprocal '
            'concessions was a staggering failure for the UK”.',

            'there is the added anxiety that vital ingredients could be scarce '

            'brussels sprouts, stuffing balls and potatoes, with a gravy and '
            'cranberry sauce. Heinz will produce only 500 cans of its '
            'Christmas Dinner Big Soup this year, but has hinted it could roll '
            'out greater numbers next year if it proves a hit with shoppers. '
            'The cans, which cost £1.50 plus post and packaging, are available '
            'online from Monday. Anke von Hanstein, the brand manager for '
            'Heinz Soups, said: “It is made for those with a big love for '
            'hearty festive flavours and tastes just perfect with a slice of '
            'warm crusty bread. Any soup that includes pigs in blankets and '
            'roasties is a winner in our eyes.” A survey of 2,027 UK adults '

            'expected to spend between £30 and £60 a head, while 8% were '
            'willing to splash out between £70 and £100 a head. Experts have '

{'article': 'Almost a quarter of workers are actively planning to change '
            'employers in the next few months, a report has claimed, as part '
            'of a “great resignation” prompted by a high number of vacancies '
            'and burnout caused by the pandemic. A survey of 6,000 workers by '
            'the recruitment firm Randstad UK found that 69% of them were '
            'feeling confident about moving to a new role in the next few '
            'months, with 24% planning a change within three to six months.\n'
            'The company said it would normally expect up to 11% of workers to '
            'move jobs every year. It has warned that such a move will have '
            'considerable cost implications for employers – as much as £25,000 '
            'for each worker – and said it has been advising clients to start '
            'looking at whether they needed to improve pay and other '
            'conditions to help them retain their best staff. Victoria Short, '
            'CEO at Randstad UK, said some of those looking for new jobs were '
            'workers who during the pandemic had stayed in roles they were '
            'unhappy with. She said: “Another factor is burnout. Some teams '
            'have been running too hot for too long. The pandemic has changed '
            'how some people think about life, work, and what they want out of '
            'both. It’s made people step back and rethink their lives. Covid '
            'has reminded them that life is too short.” The research found '
            'that only 16% of workers described themselves as worried about '
            'trying to get a new job. Workers currently employed in '
            'construction, tech and logistics were all confident they would '
            'find new opportunities, with workers in manufacturing being the '
            'most confident. Randstad warned the mass resignations will come '
            'at considerable cost to the UK’s private sector. Research carried '
            'out by Oxford Economics found that it takes recently hired '
            'professional workers 28 weeks to reach optimum productivity – '
            'which has an attached cost of £25,200 per employee, it said. '
            'Short added: “The Great Resignation is going to be tricky for '
            'those industries that can move workers around. It is going to be '
            'very difficult indeed for industries where employees are trying '
            'to get out altogether. A shortage of workers in some industries '
            'has led companies to offer signing on bonuses of up to £10,000 to '
            'attract recruits, although some surveys have suggested many do '
            'not plan to increase wages. The latest Lloyds Bank Business '
            'Barometer, published on Monday, found that 48% of businesses said '
            'it had become easier to hire people with the right skills or '
            'experience since the end of the furlough scheme. When asked about '
            'wage growth, 43% of firms said they were expecting a 2% increase '
            'in average pay over the next 12 months, while 25% anticipated a '
            '3% rise.\n'
            'Overall, Lloyds said business confidence in October was at its '
            'second highest level since March 2020, and that staff shortages '
            'suffered in some sectors may be starting to ease. Hann-Ju Ho, a '
            'senior commercial banking economist at Lloyds Bank, said '
            'businesses are feeling relatively buoyant and overall business '
            'confidence is above the long-term average. “With 60% of firms '
            'saying that they expect to bring all their furloughed staff back '
            'to work, and a further 30% intending to bring back more than '
            'half, it should bode well for the labour market as we head into '

            'forward flick that rookie Elijah Molden snatched out of the air '
            'and scored on a two-yard return to break a 24-24 tie. It was '
            'Tennessee’s first interception return for a score in 38 games. '
            'Jacksonville Jaguars 7–31 Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith ran for one '
            'score and threw a pair of touchdown passes to DK Metcalf, and the '
            'Seattle Seahawks snapped their three-game losing skid by thumping '
            'the Jacksonville Jaguars. In what may be his final start while '
            'Russell Wilson recovers from finger surgery, Smith was terrific '
            'picking apart the Jaguars defense for one of the best '
            'performances of his career. Smith completed his first 14 passes '
            'the longest streak to start a game in the NFL this season. He '
            'finished 20 of 24 for 195 yards, and his 83.3% completion '
            'percentage was a career best with at least 20 pass attempts. '
            'Miami Dolphins 11–26 Buffalo Bills Josh Allen tossed a go-ahead '
            'touchdown pass to Gabriel Davis to lift the host Buffalo Bills '
            'over the Miami Dolphins. Davis’ score was the first touchdown of '
            'the game for Buffalo (5-2). Allen added a fourth-quarter '
            'touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs, and the Bills’ ferocious defense '
            'held on for the win. Miami (1-7) lost their seventh straight game '
            'overall and seventh consecutive contest in the series against '
            'Buffalo. San Francisco 49ers 33–22 Chicago Bears Jimmy Garoppolo '
            'passed for 322 yards and ran for two touchdowns and Elijah '
            'Mitchell rushed for a career-best 137 yards and a score to help '
            'the visiting San Francisco 49ers defeat the Chicago Bears to snap '
            'a four-game losing streak. San Francisco (3-4) used an 18-point '
            'fourth quarter to surge ahead of Chicago (3-5), who have lost '
            'three straight. The 49ers scored on seven successive possessions '
            'before a series of kneel-downs to close the game. Philadelphia '
            'Eagles 44–6 Detroit Lions Boston Scott and Jordan Howard each had '
            'two touchdowns on the ground, helping the Philadelphia Eagles run '
            'over the Detroit Lions. The Eagles (3-5) ended a two-game losing '
            'streak against a team that was very accommodating. The Lions '
            '(0-8) go into their bye week as the NFL’s only winless team. The '
            'break gives first-year coach Dan Campbell extra time to figure '
            'out how to avoid leading the league’s first 0-17 team after being '
            'a tight end on the first 0-16 team in Detroit 13 years ago. '
            'Washington 10–17 Denver Broncos Justin Simmons and Denver’s '
            'defense held firm after a fumble gave Washington the ball back, '
            'and the Broncos blocked two field goals on their way to a 17-10 '
            'win that stopped a four-game slide. Melvin Gordon III caught a '
            'touchdown pass and ran for the go-ahead score from 7 yards out '
            'with 4:31 remaining. He also fumbled with 21 seconds to go, '
            'giving Washington the ball at the Denver 24-yard line. The '
            'defense forced Taylor Heinicke to throw the ball out of the back '
            'of the end zone on the last play of the game. Carolina Panthers '
            '13-19 Atlanta Falcons Zane Gonzalez kicked four field goals and '
            'Chuba Hubbard scored on a six-yard run to seal Carolina’s 19-13 '
            'win over the Atlanta Falcons, snapping a four-game skid for the '
            'Panthers. Carolina’s defense stuffed Matt Ryan and the Falcons, '
            'who managed just 213 yards total offense. Ryan had one of the '
            'worst games of his career, throwing for just 146 yards with two '

{'article': 'Joe Biden has given a pledge that if the US returns to the Iran '
            'nuclear agreement, it will only subsequently leave if Tehran '
            'clearly breaks the terms of the deal. The US president made the '
            'commitment, which addresses one of Iran’s key negotiating '
            'demands, in a joint statement issued with Germany, France and the '
            'UK. The statement followed a meeting on the margins of the G20 in '
            'Rome attended by Biden, Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s '
            'Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Boris Johnson. The key paragraph of '
            'a lengthy statement read: “We welcome President Biden’s clearly '
            'demonstrated commitment to return the US to full compliance with '
            'the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action] and to stay in '
            'full compliance, so long as Iran does the same.” The pledge was '
            'welcomed by Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian ambassador to '
            'multilateral bodies in Vienna, where talks on the future of the '
            'Iran nuclear deal have been on pause since June. Throughout the '
            'talks Iran has been seeking an undertaking, ideally legally '
            'underpinned, that if Iran returns to the deal, future US '
            'administrations will not repeat the walkout of the previous '
            'president, Donald Trump, which was accompanied by the imposition '
            'of tighter economic sanctions on Iran’s financial institutions '
            'and political bodies. Biden is hamstrung in the value of the '
            'guarantees he can give to Iran because the nuclear deal is not a '
            'signed treaty endorsed by the US Senate, and he cannot bind the '
            'hands of future US administrations. However, the Biden pledge, '
            'underwritten by the main three European powers, may be a sign '
            'that the US wants to create a more positive atmosphere before the '
            'resumption of the Vienna talks that Iran has – after much '
            'pressure and delay – promised will happen at some point in '
            'November. There have already been six rounds of talks, but they '
            'broke off in June to allow the new Iranian government, led by the '
            'president, Ebrahim Raisi, to review its negotiating strategy. '
            'During a speech to the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday, Biden said '
            'the US will respond to Iranian attacks on US interests in '
            'countries such as Syria, but implied that America preferred using '
            'economic leverage rather than military force if Iran refused to '
            'return to the negotiating table in Vienna to discuss the future '
            'of the 2015 nuclear deal. He added the US was still paying the '
            'price of bad choices made by the Trump administration, including '
            'the decision to quit the nuclear deal in 2018. But he insisted he '
            'and European leaders at the summit had agreed diplomacy was the '
            'best way forward in handling Iran over the future of the nuclear '
            'deal. He said: “We came together to reiterate our shared belief '
            'that diplomacy is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a '
            'nuclear weapon and discussed how best to encourage Iran to resume '
            'serious good faith negotiations”. It is not clear if his remarks '
            'means the US would disapprove if Israel launched military strikes '
            'against Iran if Israel believed Iran was close to being able to '
            'assemble the material needed to make a nuclear weapon. The US '
            'secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Sunday that the '
            'United States was “absolutely in lock step” with Britain, Germany '
            'and France on getting Iran back into a nuclear deal, but added it '
            'was unclear if Tehran was willing to rejoin the talks in a '
            '“meaningful way”. “It really depends on whether Iran is serious '
            'about doing that,” Blinken said of rejoining the nuclear talks. '
            '“All of our countries, working by the way with Russia and China, '
            'believe strongly that that would be the best path forward,” he '
            'added. “But we do not yet know whether Iran is willing to come '
            'back to engage in a meaningful way,” Blinken said. “But if it '
            'isn’t, if it won’t, then we are looking together at all of the '
            'options necessary to deal with this problem.” The shift in the US '
            'tone comes a week after a cyber-attack disabled Iran’s petrol '
            'stations, an attack attributed on Sunday by Brig Gen Gholamreza '
            'Jalali, the head of Iran’s civil defence organisation, to Israel '
            'and the US. The west has become increasingly concerned that '
            'Iran’s delay is a subterfuge, and that Tehran has been using the '
            'pause to strengthen its stockpile of uranium, weaken the UN '
            'nuclear inspections process and become more familiar with the use '
            'of advanced centrifuges that can produce highly enriched uranium. '
            'The US is concerned that Iran’s “breakout” time for developing a '
            'nuclear weapon is reducing and that the value of returning to the '
            'deal is fast diminishing. It has been looking at alternative '
            'options if it decides that diplomacy will not work. In a bid to '
            'entrench a revived deal further, Iran is also seeking pledges '
            'from the EU about its response if the US was to walk out of the '
            'deal a second time. It wants firm pledges that the EU would put '
            'more money into Instex, the trading device that the EU set up to '
            'ensure Iran and the EU could evade US sanctions. It also wants '
            'the EU to allow China and Russia to join the scheme. Instex has '
            'largely been inoperable ever since it was set up by the EU with '
            'fanfare more than four years ago. The US E3 joint statement '
            'issued in Rome at the margins of the G20 summit also contained no '
            'demand that Iran, as part of any agreement, commit to follow-on '
            'negotiations about what the west regards as its destabilising '
            'behaviour in the region. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein '
            'Amir-Abdollahian, said in an interview published at the weekend '
            'that there was no need for the negotiation and the simplest '
            'solution was for Biden to issue an executive order saying he was '
            'returning to the nuclear deal and lifting sanctions. '
            'Amir-Abdollahian said his administration was embracing a balanced '
            'foreign policy, a phrase implying that Iran is going to '
            'deprioritise relations with the west, including the main European '
            'powers.',

{'article': 'In a year when talk over the virtual garden fence has focused on '
            'whether you have been jabbed, jagged or had both doses yet, and '
            'whether it was Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Moderna you were injected '
            'with, Oxford Languages has chosen vax as its word of the year. '
            'After deciding last year that it was impossible to sum up 2020 in '
            'one word, the company that produces the Oxford English Dictionary '
            'said the shorthand for vaccine had “injected itself into the '
            'bloodstream of the English language” this year during the Covid '
            'pandemic. In September usage of the word “vax” was up more than '
            '72 times from its level last year, the firm said. The word, and '
            'others related to vaccination, had also been broadened into a '
            'wider range of contexts including “fully vaxxed” and “vax cards”. '
            'Oxford Languages also tracked the rise and fall of vaccine '
            'vocabulary, from the usage of “vaccine distribution” in December '
            '2020 to “vaccine rollout” and “vaccine passport” becoming common '
            'parlance by mid-March this year. Jab, which started off in US '
            'English, is now seen far more commonly in Britain, according to '
            'Oxford Language’s analysis. In Scotland, jag has proven to be a '
            'frequently used alternative. Vax has also been used in words to '
            'describe those against the jab, such as anti-vax or anti-vaxxers. '
            'The company said the trend had been seen in other languages, with '
            'the use of “vacina” being heard 10 times more in Portugal than it '
            'was a decade ago, and the French “vaccin” now almost exclusively '
            'referring to the Covid inoculation, according to the report. '
            'Casper Grathwohl, the president of Oxford Languages, said: “When '
            'reviewing the language evidence, vax stood out as an obvious '
            'choice. The word’s dramatic spike in usage caught our attention '
            'first. Then we ran the analysis and a story started to emerge, '
            'revealing how vax sat at the centre of our preoccupations this '
            'year. “The evidence was everywhere, from dating apps (vax 4 vax) '
            'and pent-up frustrations (hot vax summer) to academic calendars '
            '(vaxx to school) and bureaucratic operations (vax pass). In '
            'monopolising our discourse, it’s clear the language of vaccines '
            'is changing how we talk – and think – about public health, '
            'community and ourselves.” The notion of vaccines have been in the '
            'English language since the late 1790s, around the time Edward '
            'Jenner found that cowpox could be used as a vaccine against the '
            'deadly smallpox virus. The dictionary publisher assessed the '
            'frequency in use of the word by looking at news content from '
            'around the world. Dr Mercedes Durham, a reader in '
            'sociolinguistics at Cardiff University, said the choice of “vax” '
            'made sense because of its adaptability. “The word itself, to me '
            'it almost has a meme quality. With a meme you take the picture '
            'and add things, words, on to it. In some ways you take ‘vax’ and '
            'add ‘passport’ or ‘anti’ or ‘double’ and because it’s such a '
            'short word you can add different things on to it,” she said. '
            '“It’s not that surprising it’s something related to vaccination '
            'because these things try to get a spirit of the times, and people '
            'have spent more time thinking about vaccines than they ever have '
            'before.” She added that social media were likely to have an '
            'impact, meaning words devised by younger generations now had more '
            'of a reach. “Everyone within their own family and their own '
            'circle comes up with new words, and most of the time they stay '
            'within that circle. What social media can do, with something like '
            'vaccinations, is if you see someone tweeting about being ‘double '
            'vaxxed’, and then somebody else tweeting about ‘double vaxxed’, '
            'then you pick it up – and things that may have been in different '
            'small groups becomes much more widespread.” The report said: “For '
            'lexicographers, it is rare to observe a single topic impact '
            'language so dramatically, and in such a short period of time '
            'become a critical part of our everyday communication. As reports '
            'of medical breakthroughs and rollouts (or strollouts) of vaccines '
            'emerged throughout the year, Oxford Languages’ monitor corpus of '
            'English tracked a worldwide surge in vaccine-related vocabulary.”',

{'article': 'In a huge upset to New Zealand birds, but a win for one of the '
            'country’s only native land mammals, a bat has swooped in “by a '
            'long way” to take out the annual bird of the year competition. '
            'Forest and Bird, which runs the election, threw the bat among the '
            'pigeons as a surprise entry this year. The pekapeka-tou-roa, or '
            'long tailed bat, is one of two bats in the country and one of the '
            'rarest mammals in the world. It is as small as a thumb, and the '
            'size of a bumblebee when it is born. The voting closed on Sunday '
            'night, which appropriately was Halloween. Forest and Bird’s Lissy '
            'Fehnker-Heather announced the win to RNZ’s Morning Report on '
            'Monday. The pekapeka-tou-roa flew ahead of the avian flock by '
            '3,000 votes, she said, adding that this year’s competition drew '
            'the highest number of total votes in the competition’s 17 year '
            'history.\n'
            '“We had about 58,000 votes and they came from all around the '
            'world,” she said.\n'
            'On being asked whether the bat’s entry was a stunt, '
            'Fehnker-Heather said: “No, bats are New Zealand’s only native '
            'land mammals, and they are classed as nationally critical. They '
            'face a lot of the same threats that our native birds do, so this '
            'year, we thought we’ll try and get more people aware of that.” '
            'Rats, possums, stoats and cats are all a major threat to the '
            'species, and responsible for its population declining by roughly '
            '5% a year, she said.\n'
            'The bat may have been helped in the polls by powerful backers: '
            'New Zealand’s ministry of environment announced it was endorsing '
            'the pekapeka campaign. In second place, was the world’s only the '
            'only nocturnal and flightless parrot and last year’s champion, '
            'the kākāpō. In third was the tītipounamu, or rifleman, considered '
            'by Māori to be the messenger to the gods. In fourth, was the '
            'cheeky Kea, the world’s only alpine parrot, known for destroying '
            'cars and being exceptionally clever. In fifth place was the '
            'Antipodean Albatross, one of New Zealand’s largest seabirds.\n'
            'The annual competition is no stranger to controversy. In 2019, '
            'the arrival of hundreds of votes from Russia sparked claims of '
            'election meddling. The votes were ultimately judged legitimate, '
            'and a Forest and Bird spokesperson said at the time that interest '
            'from Russian ornithologists may be responsible. The year before, '
            'Forest and Bird alleged that 300 fraudulent votes were cast in '
            'the online ballot by Australians attempting to rig the contest in '
            'favour of the shag. Fehnker-Heather demured on whether further '
            'threatened flying species such as bees would be included future '

{'article': 'Another Sunday night, another big drama taking itself very '
            'seriously. This time, it’s Showtrial (BBC One), which follows a '
            'high-stakes murder case taking place under the spotlight of '
            'intense public attention and media scrutiny. Early on, it is '
            'called “the trial that has gripped the nation”, and the idea is '
            'to explore whether the truth matters or not: will the verdict be '
            'based on what actually happened, or on what the jury makes of the '
            'defendant? It is a strong premise, and one that speaks to our '
            'image-obsessed, issue-led times. And boy, do these characters '
            'have issues to navigate. Showtrial should eventually become a '
            'courtroom drama, but the opening episode instead treads familiar '
            'cop-show territory. After a student ball in Bristol, second-year '
            'English and philosophy student Hannah Ellis (Abra Thompson) is '
            'reported missing by her mother. Enter police officers who all '
            'have bantering nicknames such as “Cueball” (bald) and “Butch '
            'Cassidy” (er, short hair, surname Cassidy), to crack the case. '
            'Thanks to the scene that opens proceedings – we see who is in the '
            'dock in the first few moments – we already know that Hannah is '
            'not about to be found at a friend’s house nursing a hangover. The '
            'slow, steady reveal of what we do know, however, is devastating '
            'and done with care. The phone call Hannah’s mother makes to the '
            'police, insisting that she knows deep down that something is '
            'wrong, is surely every viewer’s worst nightmare. This is the show '
            'at its most sober and reserved. Hannah’s phone shows that she was '
            'in receipt of some nasty texts from Talitha Campbell (Céline '
            'Buckens), the wealthy, plummy daughter of a 90s “It girl” and an '
            'unscrupulous property developer (or, as DI Cassidy – who has the '
            'pleasure of questioning Talitha – describes her, “a rude, '
            'entitled little cow”). Hannah was the first person in her family '
            'to go to university, while Talitha was expelled from a fancy '
            'private girls’ school and can barely speak to another human being '
            'without treating them like a member of staff. Hannah was working '
            'at the ball on the night she disappeared; Talitha was partying '
            'there. They may have been friends once, but the '
            'upstairs/downstairs dynamic does Talitha no favours. It’s not '
            'just class that causes tension. Talitha tells the police that she '
            'and Hannah fell out over Talitha’s sex work, and that Hannah '
            'accused her of “enabling predators” and covering up sexual abuse '
            'on campus. Much like Vigil, made by the same production company, '
            'it ladles on idea after idea. There is class, murder and sex, so '
            'why not chuck in the political establishment, too? Talitha’s '
            'housemate and friend Dillon – who is pretending to know a lot '
            'less about Hannah than he clearly does – is the son of the shadow '
            'environment secretary. According to Talitha, her own father, the '
            'weaselly Sir Damian Campbell, is well known for bulldozing an '
            'orphanage with children still inside it to build a luxury hotel, '
            'but now he is being welcomed on to a government taskforce. It is '
            'fair to say that there is a lot going on. It’s odd, then, that '
            'this feels like such a slow burn. Talitha is arrested, at first, '
            'on suspicion of sending malicious communications to Hannah, and '
            'as she stews in her cell in a padded jacket, tapping her neon '
            'green nails, she decides to go full Veruca Salt. She preens, she '
            'yawns, she giggles inappropriately. She is condescending and rude '
            'to police officers and her own lawyer, the lucky duty solicitor '
            'who is inevitably brilliant and ends up on the case. Cleo (Tracy '
            'Ifeachor) wastes no time whipping her client into shape – and '
            'stressing just how serious things could get. There are so many '
            'evil property developers, tough northern detectives and shady '
            'establishment figures covering up for their kids in crime dramas '
            'these days that they are all starting to blur into the same show: '
            'is it Bloodlands, or Marcella, or indeed Vigil? For all its '
            'promise of something different, Showtrial initially plays the '
            'same tune, teasing out 50 minutes or so of steady plot, before '
            'walloping the audience over the head with a showy twist or a '
            'development that makes next week’s episode a must-see. For a show '
            'that is so interested in entitlement, it does feel oddly entitled '
            'to viewers’ attention. Still, it knows what it is doing, and it '
            'is solid enough that I now need to know how it gets from A to B. '
            'As for whether it will be the show that grips the nation, the '
            'jury is still out.',

{'article': 'Defensive drills will loom large in Tonga’s workload this week '
            'after they conceded 10 tries in their 60-14 defeat by Scotland on '
            'Saturday. The tourists were due to welcome eight additional '
            'players to their squad yesterday as they began preparations for '
            'their match against England on Saturday but, with little time to '
            'integrate the newcomers, they will surely face similar problems '
            'at Twickenham.\n'
            'As individuals the Tongans presented a fierce physical challenge '
            'to the home team. As a collective they lacked the solid structure '
            'needed to keep a well-drilled home attack at bay. Kyle Steyn in '
            'particular exploited that shortcoming ruthlessly, becoming the '
            'first Scot since Gavin Hastings in 1995 to score four tries in a '
            'Test. Rufus McLean touched down twice, Pierre Schoeman, George '
            'Turner, Nick Haining and Oli Kebble also scored tries, and Blair '
            'Kinghorn and Ross Thompson added three and two conversions, '
            'respectively. David Lolohea claimed the Tongans’ solitary try, to '
            'which James Faiva added three penalties. “Clearly we had some '
            'challenges, especially in the first half, around our defensive '
            'organisation and connection,” Tonga’s acting head coach, Grant '
            'Doorey, said. “Scotland scored a couple of set-piece tries, so '
            'that will be a focus area. “But we will also be working hard to '
            'look at the positives. There was a lot of good energy. At times '
            'we looked really good with ball in hand; we were able to put '
            'pressure on Scotland in different parts of the field. “But we '
            'didn’t manage position and territory, so those position and '
            'territory aspects will be absolutely fundamental against England. '
            'Clearly we’ll have to work hard on our defensive side of the game '
            'to prepare for England.”\n'
            'By contrast Gregor Townsend could hardly have hoped for a more '
            'reassuring start to his team’s Autumn Nations Series, although a '
            'high penalty count and some defensive lapses will be a concern '
            'for the Scotland coach, who said he had been impressed by some of '
            'the visitors’ play. “We were aware Tonga didn’t have their full '
            'squad available but I thought they played some good rugby,” he '
            'said. “They showed they should be a growing team over the next '
            'few years.” In common with his Tongan counterparts, Townsend will '
            'welcome a number of new players to his squad as they prepare for '
            'Sunday’s match against Australia. Captain Stuart Hogg and the '
            'fly-half Finn Russell are two who appear sure to return to the '
            'starting lineup after missing out on Saturday . The match fell '
            'outside the international window.',

{'article': 'Jen Psaki, Joe Biden’s White House press secretary, said on '
            'Sunday she had tested positive for Covid-19.\n'
            'Psaki, 42, did not travel with Biden to Rome for this week’s G20 '
            'summit. The president is also due to travel to Glasgow for the '
            'Cop26 climate talks. Biden has been accompanied in Europe by his '
            'principal deputy press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. News of a '
            'positive test for such a close aide to the president came a '
            'little over a year after an outbreak at the White House reached '
            'the then president, Donald Trump, who fell seriously ill and was '
            'forced to spend time in hospital. In a statement, Psaki said she '
            'last saw the 78-year-old Biden on Tuesday, “when we sat outside '
            'more than 6ft apart and wore masks”. Biden tested negative for '
            'Covid-19 on Saturday, Reuters quoted “a person familiar with the '
            'matter” as saying. Psaki said she stayed in the US “due to a '
            'family emergency, which was members of my household testing '
            'positive for Covid-19”. She has two children. “Since then,” Psaki '
            'continued, “I have quarantined and tested negative via PCR for '
            'Covid on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. However, today '
            'I tested positive for Covid. “While I have not had close contact '
            'in person with the president or senior members of the White House '
            'staff since Wednesday and tested negative for four days after '
            'that last contact, I am disclosing today’s positive test out of '
            'an abundance of transparency.” Psaki also said that “thanks to '
            'the vaccine I have only experienced mild symptoms, which has '
            'enabled me to continue working from home. “I will plan to return '
            'to work in person at the conclusion of the 10-day quarantine '
            'following a negative rapid test, which is an additional White '
            'House requirement beyond [Centers for Disease Control and '
            'Prevention] guidance, taken out an abundance of caution.” White '
            'House staff and others traveling with the president began '
            'undergoing daily tests for Covid-19 before departing Washington '
            'and are all fully vaccinated. Many officials have also received '
            'booster shots, due to the close-quarters environment and frequent '
            'travel associated with their work. Biden got his Covid-19 booster '
            'on 27 September, shortly after federal regulators approved the '
            'third dose for many Americans. On Sunday Eric Feigl-Ding, an '
            'epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American '
            'Scientists, responded to the news that Psaki had worn a mask '
            'around Biden by tweeting: “Good to still mask up, even if '
            'vaxxed.”\n'
            'According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has recorded nearly '
            '46m cases of Covid-19 and more than 745,000 deaths. Resistance to '
            'vaccination mandates remains a concern, particularly among '
            'Republican voters, though case numbers are slowing. On Sunday, '
            'the CDC said the US had administered 422,070,099 doses of '
            'Covid-19 vaccines, up from 420,657,683 doses on Saturday. The '

            'while 192,453,500 people were fully vaccinated. The CDC tally '
            'includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and '
            'Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine. About 18.6 million people '
            'have received a booster dose. Full approval for children aged '

{'article': 'Emergency services have scrambled to respond to a collision of '
            'two trains near Salisbury on Sunday night, in a critical incident '
            'that left one train carriage derailed. About 50 firefighters from '
            'Dorset and Wiltshire, Hampshire and Isle of Wight and South '
            'Western fire and rescue services are at the scene, which is close '
            'to London Road in Salisbury, along with Wiltshire police and '
            'Network Rail. The British Transport Police (BTP) said: “There '
            'have been no fatalities, however a number of people have been '
            'injured. “Most of these people are walking wounded however a '
            'small number, including the driver, have been taken to hospital '
            'where their injuries are being assessed. “A major incident has '

            'We will remain on scene throughout the night working to establish '
            'the full circumstances of how this incident came to happen.”\n'
            'The BTP said a casualty centre has been set up at St Mark’s '
            'Church in Salisbury. Train services in the area have been halted. '
            'Dimitri Popa, 17, was on the first train carriage travelling from '
            'London Waterloo. “It all happened very fast. There was a big '
            'crash, then I saw flames,” he said. “The carriage was 45 degrees '
            'to the right. We didn’t know where we were or anything, we were '
            'very shocked.” Morgan Harris, 20, travelling on the same train, '
            'was thrown from his seat. “It was all going along normally then '
            'all of a sudden there was a massive bang and all of the lights '
            'went out,” he said. “There [were] sparks and flames from where we '
            'had come off the track. There was a load of ash coming from '
            'outside. Our train was on its side. I was thrown out of my seat '
            'and I banged around the table.” Grant Shapps, the transport '
            'secretary, said investigations into the crash would be undertaken '
            'in order to help prevent similar “serious” incidents in future. '
            'The BTP said officers were called at 6.46pm and responded to an '

            'carriage of a GWR train struck an object on its approach to '
            'Salisbury station and came off the tracks. “The derailment '
            'knocked out all of the signalling in the area,” the Network Rail '
            'spokesperson added. “Subsequently, the 17.20 South Western '
            'Railway service from London Waterloo to Honiton then collided '

            'we dealt with the crisis that was caused by Covid. “… I believe '
            'we will pass my Build Back Better plan. I believe we will pass '
            'the infrastructure bill. Combined, they have $900bn in dealing '
            'with climate resilience, the largest investment in the history of '
            'the world that’s ever occurred. And it’s going to pass in my '
            'view, but we’ll see. We’ll see.” Biden has staked his presidency '
            'on his spending plans but Democrats in Congress have been split '
            'between progressives and moderates led by two senators, Joe '
            'Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Biden '
            'delayed his departure to Rome to plead with Democrats to pass his '
            'spending agenda. “We are at an inflection point,” he reportedly '
            'told House members. “The rest of the world wonders whether we can '
            'function.” Whether Democrats can deliver could also have '
            'significant implications for the midterm elections next year. '
            'Historically, parties holding the presidency fail to keep the '
            'House. Top Democrats reportedly want a final version of Biden’s '
            '$1.75tn spending plan drafted by Sunday and passed by Tuesday. '
            'The price tag has come down dramatically, from $3.5tn, with '
            'concessions to Manchin and Sinema. The infrastructure deal is '
            'valued at $1tn. Discussions continued throughout the weekend. '
            'Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate budget committee, told '
            'CNN’s State of the Union: “I can tell you, we are working right '
            'now. I spent all of yesterday on the telephone … as soon as I '
            'leave the studio, I’m going to be going back home to get on the '
            'phone.” Sanders said he was optimistic and added: “This is not '
            'easy stuff, but what we are trying to do is put together the most '
            'consequential piece of legislation in the modern history of this '
            'country, which will transform the role of government in '
            'protecting the needs of working families.” Sanders said he was '
            'fighting for action on prescription drugs costs to be included in '
            'the spending bill, an issue on which he and Sinema are in very '
            'evident opposition. In a 50-50 Senate, and with no Republican '
            'support on spending, Manchin and Sinema are key. Democrats must '
            'use reconciliation, a way to pass budgetary initiatives via a '
            'simple majority rather than 60 votes. The vice-president, Kamala '
            'Harris, has the decisive vote. The Senate did pass the '
            'infrastructure bill in August via a bipartisan vote but House '
            'progressives stymied it in an attempt to win concessions on the '
            'spending plan. On Sunday Ro Khanna of California, a prominent '
            'House progressive, told CBS’s Face the Nation he expected '
            'success. “We are working to add things in,” he said. “The '
            'negotiations are taking place. I’m going to be a yes. I think we '
            'can have the vote by Tuesday … I’m yes on the framework.” Cabinet '
            'members also expressed optimism. The transportation secretary, '
            'Pete Buttigieg, told Fox News Sunday: “We are teed up for major '
            'action soon.” Asked if Congress would pass both pieces of '
            'legislation this week, he said: “We are the closest we have ever '
            'been.” Buttigieg also made a point sure to surface in the '
            'midterms if Biden is successful, telling ABC’s This Week he '
            '“wouldn’t let Republicans off the hook on voting for the family '
            'provisions too. “I know they probably won’t but it’s not too late '
            'for some of them to join Democrats who are united in believing '
            'that the time has come for us to actually put our money where our '
            'mouth is [and] support American families.” A Republican senator, '
            'Rick Scott of Florida, told Fox News Sunday Biden’s spending had '
            '“to end” as it was “causing inflation” and “hurting the poor '
            'families”. “We gotta live within our means like every family '
            'does,” Scott said.\n'
            'Asked if that meant Republicans should support repeal of tax cuts '
            'they passed under Donald Trump which are projected to add $2tn to '
            'the national debt, Scott said both taxes and spending should be '
            'cut. On NBC’s Meet the Press the energy secretary, Jennifer '
            'Granholm, suggested Biden’s polling would be boosted when '
            'Americans see his spending bill. “They’ll see that they’re going '
            'to get a continuation of that child tax credit,” Granholm said. '
            '“They’ll see people being put to work in clean energy all across '
            'this country. “They’re going to see the ability to have senior '
            'citizens and people with disabilities being cared for in their '
            'homes. They’ll see their costs of living come down as a result of '
            'having children. This bill and the real impacts that people will '
            'see will have an impact on those ratings.” In Rome, Biden told '
            'reporters: “You know, you all believed [the spending bill] '
            'wouldn’t happen from the very beginning, the moment I announced '
            'it, and you always seem amazed when it’s alive again. Maybe it '
            'won’t work. But I believe we’ll see by the end of next week at '
            'home that the bills have passed.” The Associated Press '
            'contributed to this report',

{'article': 'The new UK Athletics chair, Ian Beattie, has said the management '
            'exodus that occurred on his first day in the post has “opened up '
            'an opportunity to move forward” and draw a line under the past 18 '
            'months of turmoil in the sport. In his first interview since '
            'taking the helm he has unveiled a radical plan to offer leading '
            'athletes a direct say in how the governing body will be run, '
            'including the appointment of a new chief executive. It is less '
            'than two weeks since the incumbent, Joanna Coates, resigned in '
            'tandem with the performance director, Sara Symington, in what '
            'many saw as an inevitable changing of the guard following open '
            'criticism of the regime from within. Prior to his official '
            'arrival on 21 October Beattie had signalled he would immediately '
            'conduct an evaluation of UKA’s executive team.\n'
            'The Scot, head of an Edinburgh-based law firm, left little doubt '
            'that he foresaw the departures amid a perceived lack of '
            'connection with the sport at large since both were transplanted '
            'from England Netball. “The crisis was probably before they '
            'resigned,” he said. “I’m maybe trying to be diplomatic. But a lot '
            'of coaches were questioning whether the regime was capable of '
            'providing that to them. I don’t think it’s about structures and '
            'paperwork. It’s about relationships and people. And developing '
            'and having all that support structure. “So we’re looking for '
            'someone to come into that role and put a team in place that’s '
            'taking a lead. In some ways we’ve shied away from that. But we '
            'shouldn’t be. We’re a big athletics nation. We should be able to '
            'support our athletes and coaches really well.” With Coates’s desk '
            'already cleared, Beattie has turned to her erstwhile deputy, Mark '
            'Munro, for the next six months at least, recreating a chair-CEO '
            'partnership that won plaudits at Scottish Athletics. Steve '
            'Paulding and Tommy Yule, part of UKA’s Loughborough-based '
            'backroom team, will assume temporary charge of the performance '
            'programme but the recruitment process to succeed Symington has '
            'effectively already begun. “The main candidates have already been '
            'in touch,” Beattie revealed. Stephen Maguire, the former relays '
            'guru who quit when surprisingly overlooked for the position of '
            'Olympic head coach last year, is the presumed front runner. '
            'However The Guardian understands Maguire is reluctant to leave '
            'his senior role at Sport Ireland despite informal conversations '
            'about a return. Stung last time around by what some alleged to be '
            'cultural bias against the Northern Irishman, he would surely '
            'demand complete control of high performance as a carrot. Until '
            'the vacancy is filled, the future of Christian Malcolm, the '
            'appointed head coach, will remain up in the air, the Welshman '
            'rendered vulnerable by his association with the previous regime '
            'and a lack of golds from the Tokyo Olympics. UK Sport will have '
            'input into all hirings. But Beattie added: “I’m very keen that we '
            'get some involvement from our top athletes in that process.” He '
            'and Munro met with their Lottery-funded performers last Thursday '
            'to listen and reset. The prime question athletes posed was how '
            'their voices might carry greater weight. Beattie offered an '
            'illustration. “When we replaced Mark at Scottish Athletics, '
            '[Olympic medallist] Eilidh Doyle was part of our recruitment '
            'panel. And the sport liked it because they felt somebody who’s '
            'been at the very top levels was part of the process. I guess I’m '
            'looking for the same thing here. That input is important. We’re '
            'trying to be inclusive.” UKA management held a springtime meeting '
            'with a larger group of international athletes to outline their '
            'strategy. World 200 metres champion Dina Asher-Smith, a source '
            'confirmed, led vociferous criticism of the rationale for ditching '
            'one of the UK’s two high-profile Diamond League meetings, a '
            'decision which followed the loss of the sport’s lucrative '
            'television deal with the BBC. Beattie, a race organiser in his '
            'spare time, suggested a pivot is on the cards. “I’m much more '
            'positive on our role on events than maybe we’ve seen for the last '
            'couple of years,” he underlines. “I think that’s part of what we '
            'do. It gives us a shop front. It gives our athletes exposure, it '
            'gives sponsors exposure. I’m very keen to get TV involved again. '
            'That’s an important part. And without that, I think we’re missing '
            'something.”',

{'article': 'A father of three died after trying to save two struggling '
            'paddleboarders in south-west Wales on Saturday, in an “absolutely '
            'heartbreaking” incident. Paul O’Dwyer died along with two female '
            'paddleboarders he was trying to help. A third woman was reported '
            'to be in a critical condition. O’Dwyer, 42, a former soldier, '
            'jumped into the water in an attempt to rescue two women in '
            'distress, but was later pronounced dead on the banks of the River '
            'Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. “Paul put his own life '
            'on the line yesterday to make sure others were safe,” said a '
            'spokesperson for Aberavon Green Stars RFC, a rugby club O’Dwyer '
            'belonged to. The club paid tribute to O’Dwyer’s “infectious '
            'smile” and upbeat character, describing him as an “avid '
            'adventurer, whether he would be paddleboarding, surfing, skiing, '
            'walking or climbing, nothing was too small for Paul to achieve”.\n'
            'A group of nine paddleboarders were exploring the river on a '
            'weekend excursion when they got into difficulty near a weir. '
            'Dyfed-Powys police said they received reports of persons in '
            'distress shortly after 9am on Saturday. Emergency services – '
            'including 30 firefighters, the coastguard, RNLI and police '
            'helicopters – arrived at the scene and five people were rescued '
            'without injury.\n'
            'But O’Dwyer and two women lost their lives and another woman was '
            'being treated in intensive care at a local hospital on Sunday. '
            'O’Dwyer died “attempting to save two of the girls also in '
            'distress due to an unexpected downpour”, said Vickie Mckinven, '
            'who was on the trip but pulled out of the morning paddleboard '
            'over weather concerns. It is “absolutely heartbreaking”, Mckinven '
            'said, adding that O’Dwyer “did so much to raise money for '
            'charities”. O’Dwyer cofounded charity SA1UTE, which supports '
            'veterans in south Wales, and previously was a soldier with the '
            'Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers 108 Welsh Squadron militia. '
            '“He was relentless in his drive for raising money for charity,” '
            'SA1UTE said in a tribute to O’Dwyer, adding: “We have lost a '
            'friend that gave so much of his life to help others. It still '
            'hasn’t sunk in, that these tragic events have taken away someone '
            'in the prime of their life. “Paul had a real zest for life and '
            'always took things head on with a smile on his face.” O’Dwyer '
            'helped raise more than £4,000 for charity in recent weeks by '
            'paddling down the River Wye in 24 hours, navigating the 100 miles '
            'from Glasbury to Tintern Abbey. He also organised an event in '
            'September that raised more than £2,000 for the RNLI and a local '
            'lifeguard club. Dyfed-Powys police said the victims’ next of kin '
            'were being supported by specialist officers. DCI Jonathan Rees '
            'said police were investigating what provoked the tragedy, and '
            'called on the public to report any information or submit '
            'potential video footage. “At this stage, my thoughts and the '
            'thoughts of my colleagues are with the family of those who lost '
            'loved ones, and of the injured person who remains in hospital,” '
            'DCI Rees said. DCI Rees urged the public – with paddleboarding '
            'growing in popularity – to “ensure they understand the weather '
            'conditions and water conditions at a particular location where '
            'they may be enjoying that sport”. Salty Dog Co, a watersports '
            'clothing shop based in Port Talbot that was involved in the '
            'excursion, paid tribute to O’Dwyer. “It is with heavy heart that '

            'Saturday. “A lovely human being taken too soon. Our thoughts and '

            'has been warned its plan for carbon neutrality by 2050 will fail '
            'if it is solely reliant on investing in new technology. The '
            'Grattan Institute’s Towards Net Zero report, released today, has '

{'article': 'The Cop26 climate summit is at serious risk of failure because '
            'countries are still not promising enough to restrict global '
            'temperature rises to below 1.5C, Boris Johnson has warned.\n'
            'In a blunt admission after two days of preliminary talks at the '
            'G20 meeting of world leaders, the prime minister conceded little '
            'progress had been made – and the conference is not on track to '
            'achieve a deal that keeps the goal alive. He put the chances of '
            'success as “six out of 10”. “Currently, let’s be in no doubt, we '
            'are not going to hit it and we have to be honest with ourselves,” '
            'he said. The commitments being made so far were a “drop in the '
            'rapidly warming ocean”. Johnson will set out the scale of the '
            'challenge facing humanity as he opens the Cop26 leaders summit on '
            'Monday attended by almost 200 national representatives, including '
            'US president Joe Biden and India’s Narendra Modi, but missing key '
            'players such as China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. '
            'He will tell gathered leaders that the world is at “one minute to '
            'midnight” in terms of keeping warming below 1.5C, with the UN '
            'predicting a rise of 2.7C on the current trajectory – which would '
            'lead to catastrophic consequences. He gave his assessment after '
            'meetings with G20 leaders at a gathering in Rome, where he said '
            'their progress on climate change had only “inched forward”.\n'
            'Only 12 of them have pledged to reach net zero emissions “by or '
            'around 2050”. Several key nations – China and Saudi Arabia – are '
            'only formally pledging to meet that goal by 2060. The UK is also '
            'hoping for tougher pledges from countries for 2030, with experts '
            'warning emissions need to be halved by this date, when currently '
            'they are on course to rise by 15%. Australia, for example, set '
            'out a new 2050 net zero target this week, but did not make a '
            'headline commitment for this decade. As hosts of Cop26, the UK '
            'has the significant role of encouraging and negotiating pledges '
            'from almost 200 countries, with many developing nations arguing '
            'developed nations have a responsibility to do much more as they '
            'have already profited from causing historical emissions. After '
            'the leaders meet over the next two days, negotiators will work on '
            'texts with the hope of reaching a deal by 12 November.\n'
            'Johnson may come back to the summit towards the end if it looks '
            'like an agreement may be within touching distance. On the '
            'prospects of a deal that keeps to 1.5C, Johnson said: “It’s nip '
            'and tuck, it’s touch and go. We could do it, or we could fail by '
            'the middle of November.” Following the G20, there was a sense of '
            'disappointment and some trepidation from No 10 about the outcome '
            'of the Glasgow summit, although Labour has accused the government '
            'of deliberately lowering expectations in order to declare victory '
            'if there is only a modestly improved deal at the end. Speaking at '
            'a press conference, Johnson said pledges from countries to lower '
            'their emissions needed to be stronger. Experts believe that for '
            '1.5C to have a chance of success, countries need to make '
            'substantial and meaningful pledges of reductions by 2030 as well. '
            'He will also ask for promises on phasing out coal, the move to '
            'electric vehicles, an end to deforestation, and finance – pledges '
            'of money to help developing nations deal with the climate '
            'emergency.\n'
            '“The countries most responsible for historic[al] and present day '
            'emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work,” '
            'Johnson said. “If we are going to prevent Cop26 from being a '
            'failure, then that must change and I must be clear, that if '
            'Glasgow fails then the whole thing fails. The Paris agreement '
            'will have crumpled at the first reckoning.” At the Paris '
            'agreement, made in 2015, world leaders committedto keeping the '
            'global temperature rise below 2C or as close to 1.5C as possible. '
            'Johnson said that agreement and “the hope that came with it” is '
            'currently “just a piece of paper”, which needed to be filled with '
            '“granular” pledges from every country. Global average '
            'temperatures have already risen by 1.1C since the Industrial '
            'Revolution and only stringent emission cuts will prevent that '
            'increase from topping 1.5C. Johnson said there were no '
            '“compelling excuses for our procrastination”, as the world has '
            'now seen firsthand the devastation that climate change causes – '
            'from heatwaves and droughts to wildfires and hurricanes. His '
            'comments capped a weekend of at times dramatic language on '
            'climate change from Johnson, who told reporters travelling with '
            'him that he had been converted from previous scepticism following '
            'scientific briefings when he entered No 10. Asked if a commitment '
            'in the G20’s end-of-summit communique to achieve carbon '
            'neutrality “around” the middle of the century was too vague, '
            'Johnson said he had hoped for more. “I agree,” he said. “And that '
            'is a function really of the gap between some colleagues and '
            'others.” Cop26 was going to be tricky, he said: “I’m not going to '
            'sugar coat it, I’m not going to pretend it’s other than it is. I '
            'think there’s a chance that we can make progress, everybody can '
            'see how to do it. It’s a question of will and leadership.” Asked '
            'whether he had shown sufficient leadership given last week’s '
            'budget, which froze fuel duty and cut levies for short-haul '
            'flights, and cuts to the aid budget, Johnson pointed to the UK’s '
            'achievements in cutting emissions, and targets for phasing out '
            'petrol and diesel cars. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street said '
            'it would be be contributing a further £1bn over five years to '
            'climate finance, taking its commitment from £11.6bn over five '
            'years in 2019 to £12.6 billion by 2025. However, the pledged '
            'money will be drawn from the foreign aid budget, which Johnson’s '
            'government has slashed this year, and is contingent on the UK '
            'economy growing as forecast. The G20 communique stressed the '
            'importance of fulfilling the commitment to provide $100bn (£73bn) '
            'to help poor countries adapt to climate change. The UK has '
            'acknowledged that Cop26 is not going to meet the hoped-for $100bn '
            'pledge this year. The complex negotiations, which need to resolve '
            'more than 130 technical issues as well as the headline issue of '
            '“keeping 1.5 alive”, have already run into logistical trouble '
            'owing to Covid restrictions. The main negotiating room has a '
            'capacity of 144 because of social distancing. Patricia Espinosa, '
            'the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework '
            'Convention on Climate Change, said that “as we have 193 parties, '
            'that’s literally not enough”.',

{'article': 'Emmanuel Macron has accused the Australian prime minister, Scott '
            'Morrison, of lying to him over an abandoned $90bn submarine '
            'contract, in a significant escalation of tensions between Paris '
            'and Canberra. The French president levelled the accusation in '
            'impromptu comments to Australian journalists on the sidelines of '
            'the G20 summit in Rome. He said he had a lot of “respect and '
            'friendship” for Australia and Australians, but that respect '
            'between nations needed to be reciprocated. “I just say when we '
            'have respect, you have to be true and you have to behave in line '
            'and consistent with this value,” he said. When asked whether he '
            'thought Morrison had lied to him by not revealing Australia’s '
            'secret dialogue with the UK and US over the acquisition of '
            'nuclear submarines, a dialogue that ultimately became the Aukus '
            'pact, Macron was direct in his response. “I don’t think, I know,” '
            'he said.\n'
            'Morrison denied he had lied to the French president. He said he '
            'had told Macron that he had formed the view that conventional '
            'submarines would not meet Australia’s strategic interests when '
            'the two leaders met in Paris after a G7 summit this year. He said '
            'when the two had dined together at the Élysée Palace, “at that '
            'stage we had not concluded any other arrangements with any other '
            'parties”. Morrison said he understood Macron’s disappointment, '
            'but that he did not resile from the decision to abandon the '
            'French contract and proceed with the acquisition of '
            'nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the US and UK. He '
            'said doing otherwise would have elevated French disappointment '
            'above Australia’s national interests. Macron expressed scepticism '
            'to Australian journalists that the Aukus nuclear submarines would '
            'arrive on schedule. He noted there was an 18-month review of the '
            'feasibility of the arrangement, and quipped: “Good luck.” '
            'Morrison said he was confident the acquisition would proceed as '
            'planned. Under the Aukus pact, Morrison dumped a contract with '
            'France to build 12 diesel-powered submarines in favour of a deal '
            'with the US for at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. France '
            'said it had been “betrayed”, “stabbed in the back” and '
            '“deceived”. The escalation in tensions comes before a meeting '
            'between Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and her '
            'French counterpart designed to get the relationship back on '
            'track. The dispute with France dominated Morrison’s trip to Rome '
            'for the G20 summit. Shortly after Morrison had arrived in Italy, '
            'Joe Biden moved to repair his own damaged personal and political '
            'relationship with Macron by acknowledging that the Aukus '
            'announcement had been a “clumsy” episode handled with a lack of '
            'grace. Biden told Macron with television cameras present that he '
            'was “under the impression that France had been informed” about '
            'Australia’s intention to ditch the contract “long before” the '
            'Aukus pact was revealed publicly. It was unclear whether the US '
            'president was rebuking Morrison, or his own senior staff for '
            'failing to keep him abreast of the nuances. After Biden’s public '
            'rapprochement with Macron, Morrison doubled down on the decision '
            'to proceed with the nuclear submarines. He said his government '
            'had kept the Biden administration up to date “with the status of '
            'the conversations and discussions with the French government”. '
            'Macron met a number of other world leaders while at the G20 '
            'summit, but he did not schedule a bilateral discussion with '
            'Morrison. Australia’s prime minister will see Macron again at the '
            'Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Morrison was due to depart Rome for '

{'article': 'Regular readers may recall that over the summer I went rogue and '

            '(omg what now?). An emotional roller-coaster for sure, and that’s '
            'without taking into account that when we last saw the Tardis fam, '
            'Ryan (Tosin Cole) and Graham (Bradley Walsh) were back on top of '
            'that Yorkshire hill – Ryan trying to ride his bike – having left '
            'a rather maudlin Yasmin (Mandip Gill) to carry on travelling '
            'alone with the 13th Doctor (Whittaker). And so on to a new series '
            'and an opener, the Halloween Apocalypse, which wasted absolutely '
            'no time in introducing us to Dan (John Bishop). The episode was '
            'big on introducing characters and setting up a disparate set of '
            'situations – via some gorgeous CGI of outer space and planetary '
            'destruction – but didn’t have much of a story to tell. I have '
            'long clamoured for a Doctor Who Halloween special that did for '
            'the imagery of Halloween what the early Christmas specials did '
            'for the festive season, with their robot Santas and killer '
            'Christmas trees. But, despite the title, the show didn’t lean '
            'into Halloween much at all. Did the episode work to set up the '
            'series and as a standalone story? The jury is out. It felt like '
            'quite a slight story about Karvanista, interspersed with what '
            'could have been the cold openers for five or six other episodes. '

            'ahead. He reminded me a little of the Eternals from Can You Hear '
            'Me?, and it was clear from the dialogue that he has been in the '
            'universe for a very long time. Karvanista’s appearance prompted '
            'much hilarity on social media for looking like Chewbacca in the '
            'publicity images, but he came across as gruff round the edges, '
            'rather than much of a threat. And on screen, he looked more dog '
            'than Wookie.\n'
            'The redesign of the Sontarans saw them go back to their original '
            '70s look, and caused speculation that they would once again be a '
            'mighty warrior race, rather than the butt of a lot of jokes. The '
            'tiny bit of dialogue between them in chapter one suggested to me '

            'Mysteries and questions Jodie Whittaker and executive producer '
            'Matt Strevens have hinted strongly that we will get some sort of '
            'resolution – or at least further exploration – of the Timeless '
            'Child storyline. And there was some of that in chapter one. We '
            'now know that Karvanista worked for the Division – the mysterious '
            'Time Lord organisation that the Doctor may have worked for before '
            'their mind was wiped and they were turned into the William '

            'know that. And I can’t be the only person whose ears pricked up '
            'when Annabel Scholey’s mysterious character Claire said that she '
            'had come “the long way round”, a phrase associated in the show '
            'with the Doctor’s own journey and the search for Gallifrey. She '
            'also seemed to already know exactly what a Weeping Angel was. '

            'Doctor Who story to reach BBC One screens since Tom Baker’s The '

            'definitively completed via a whole series of almost definitive '
            'remakes (there’s another one out on Blu-Ray later this year). The '
            'David Tennant-led animation Dreamland was broadcast in six short '
            'parts in 2009 on the BBC’s Red Button service and website. The '

            'type of explosive developed and carried by seventh Doctor '
            'companion Ace in the late 80s. It isn’t a surprise that the '
            'Doctor Who universe has an alien species of dog people. After '
            'all, during the RTD years we met the cat people of New New York, '

            'Pertwee story The Time Warrior. It introduced the much-missed '
            'Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, and was the first story in '
            'which the Doctor mentioned the name of his home as Gallifrey. The '

{'article': 'The Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, described the chance to lead '
            'his team out in the FA Cup final at Wembley as “surreal” so soon '
            'into his tenure and reserved praise for the groundwork laid by '
            'Joe Montemurro. “It’s a little bit surreal to be honest, you '
            'never imagine you will have the chance to win a trophy or be '
            'successful so soon,” Eidevall said.\n'
            '“The closest I’ve come to being at Wembley was when I bought '
            'tickets for Adele a few years ago but then my wife and I couldn’t '
            'go. I’m definitely going this time,” he added with a smile, after '
            'a second-half goal and two assists from Beth Mead helped Arsenal '
            'to sweep aside Brighton with a dominant 3-0 win. “We have kept '
            'the foundation and we are benefiting from a lot of the '
            'relationships and experiences that this group have already made,” '
            'Eidevall said. “My club in Sweden won the Championship last week '
            'and I know I’ve been a big part of that, I coached the team for '
            '12 of the games and preseason but still I feel I have nothing to '
            'do with it even though I have. “Because you’re not emotionally '
            'connected to it in that moment. We need to recognise the '
            'contribution people make to the long-term success of clubs and '
            'Joe Montemurro needs to get credit for leaving the club in a good '
            'place for me to work with.” After her side’s defeat of Manchester '
            'City earlier in the day the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, had said '
            'she would love to meet Arsenal in the final on 5 December, the '
            '100th anniversary of the ban on women’s football. She got her '
            'wish, as Mead provided for the captain Kim Little and centre-back '
            'Leah Williamson either side of her own effort.\n'
            '“I’d rather have people afraid of playing us than looking forward '
            'to it but I know what she means, it’s going to be a great '
            'occasion,” Eidevall said of Hayes’s comments. If there was and is '
            'a team capable of upsetting the narrative it is Brighton. Last '
            'season Hope Powell’s side took points off Manchester United and '
            'Chelsea in the Women’s Super League – all but ending the former’s '
            'Champions League charge and rupturing the latter’s air of '
            'invincibility as they cantered to the league title. With board '
            'backing the growth of the Seagulls has been steady. Two '
            'ninth-placed finishes were followed by a surprising jump up to '
            'sixth last season. Now they sit fifth with five games played and '
            'look capable of climbing higher. Powell, a two-time FA Cup winner '
            'herself as a player, teased that the pressure would be on their '
            'opponents for the win.\n'
            'Predictably though it was Brighton that were immediately under '
            'pressure, in footballing terms, at a cripplingly cold '
            'Borehamwood. But by the close of the first half Arsenal were '
            'frustrated. Despite Arsenal having 64% possession, nine shots to '
            'Brighton’s two and six corners to none, the game was goalless, '
            'with the Brighton goalkeeper, Megan Walsh, excellent. Arsenal '
            'were without the star forward Vivianne Miedema, the US World Cup '
            'winner Tobin Heath and the England centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy '
            'but, as opposed to recent seasons, these absences were of the '
            'manager’s choosing and not enforced. Leading the line, the '
            'Australian forward Caitlin Foord went closest in quick succession '
            'shortly before the break. The Gunners returned to the field with '
            'the bit between their teeth and fuelled by the frustration of '
            'their lack of return on their first-half efforts.\n'
            'An almost angry Mead, who has three goals and three assists in '
            'five league games and scored four for England in the '
            'international break including a 14-minute hat-trick against '
            'Northern Ireland at Wembley, sped in from the left, wrongfooted '
            'the excellent Maya Le Tissier and passed to Little who flicked up '
            'and in. Just four minutes later and a similar burst on the left '
            'saw Mead come in from the left before firing low past the '
            'watching Walsh. With 15 minutes remaining a Mead corner was '
            'powerfully headed in by Williamson to set up the Wembley showdown '
            'with Chelsea.',

{'article': 'Heady days at West Ham, who moved level on points with Manchester '
            'City in the Premier League’s top four just days after knocking '
            'Pep Guardiola’s side out of the Carabao Cup. Aston Villa, too, '
            'went into this season with ambitions of jostling with the '
            'strongest clubs but they and West Ham look poles apart. This '
            'scoreline was a fair reflection of the supremacy of David Moyes’s '
            'side even if two of the visitors’ goals came after Ezri Konsa was '
            'sent off for Villa, who have much to ponder after a fourth '
            'successive defeat.\n'
            'Although Ollie Watkins briefly drew Villa level by cancelling out '
            'Ben Johnson’s opening goal, West Ham always looked the more '
            'likely winners. Declan Rice soon made it 2-1 and Villa’s problems '
            'deepened before Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen inflicted further '
            'punishment late on. From the outset this looked like a contest '
            'between two clubs at very different stages of development. West '
            'Ham were strong and slick, a formidable collective in which every '
            'player knew his part and performed it well. Villa seemed a weak '
            'jumble. Dean Smith had tried to avoid a fourth defeat in a row by '
            'changing his system and making bold personnel selections, '
            'including drafting in Kortney Hause for the dropped captain, '
            'Tyrone Mings. But Villa appeared to be gripped by tension as they '
            'passed sloppily and lacked energy, standing off their opponents '
            'from the first whistle. West Ham were quick to take advantage. In '
            'the seventh minute Rice strode through midfield and then floated '
            'a pass wide to Johnson on the right. The full-back cut inside '
            'Matt Targett with far too much ease before curling a low '
            'left-footed shot beyond Emi Martínez. It was a splendid finish by '
            'the 21-year-old academy graduate, whose emergence since Vladimir '
            'Coufal’s injury offers further vindication of Moyes, who had been '
            'criticised for not securing a more experienced right-back as '
            'deputy to the impressive Czech. Villa’s malaise continued after '
            'the early setback. In the 16th minute Matt Cash made important '
            'blocks to prevent Bowen from increasing the visitors’ lead. By '
            'the 20th minute the home crowd were groaning at Villa defenders '
            'for playing the ball around at the back. It was not that Villa '
            'were intentionally negative, rather that they seemed unsure how '
            'to play their way forward.\n'
            'They were not helped by the loss to injury of Jacob Ramsey in the '
            '15th minute, after which Ashley Young joined the attempt to stop '
            'Rice and Toumas Soucek from controlling midfield. Leon Bailey, '
            'finally fit enough to make his first start for Villa after '
            'electrifying performances off the bench, made little impact. '
            'Ditto Emi Buendía. The encouraging thing for Villa was that when '
            'they pressed vigorously for the first time, on the half-hour, '
            'Watkins forced Lukasz Fabianski to give away a corner. Two '
            'minutes later Cash sent the hosts’ first shot wide from over 20 '
            'yards. West Ham were hardly on the ropes but soon Villa landed a '
            'blow that counted. John McGinn invited Buendía to do something '
            'useful down the right and the Argentinian obliged, dodging past '
            'Fornals and firing in a low cross that found its way to Watkins. '
            'The striker finished smartly from 12 yards. Four minutes later '
            'West Ham reasserted their supremacy. Rice was again allowed too '
            'much space in midfield and he used it to rifle a low shot from 25 '
            'yards into the net via the post. Martínez, apparently unsighted, '
            'was uncharacteristically slow to react. At half-time Villa were '
            'fortunate to be only 2-1 down. Their luck soon evaporated, with '
            'Konsa sent off moments after the resumption. He was initially '
            'only booked for bringing down Bowen just outside the area but the '
            'referee, Chris Kavanagh, reached for the red after reviewing the '
            'incident on the pitchside monitor. That seemed unduly harsh but, '
            'on the other hand, Hause could have been dismissed for catching '
            'Bowen with his elboe in the same move. Villa found purpose after '
            'being reduced to 10 men. They nearly equalised after 57 minutes, '
            'when McGinn crossed from the right for Watkins. Fabianski tipped '
            'the striker’s header onto the crossbar and out. Now West Ham were '
            'in a fight. But Fornals soon finished off the hosts. Moments '
            'after being booked for an ugly challenge on Marvelous Nakamba, '
            'the midfielder rounded off a counterattack by netting from close '
            'range after Martínez parried a shot by Manuel Lanzini into his '
            'path. The fact that Nakamba was still off the pitch receiving '
            'treatment infuriated the locals. Lanzini annoyed them further by '
            'presenting Bowen with a simple finish after West Ham sliced '
            'through Villa again. “This a special group and a special '
            'environment at the minute,” said a jubilant Rice. “This is the '
            'level, the standard. We can’t drop if we want to be a big team.” '
            'Smith, aware he is under pressure, insisted that Villa will get '
            'back on track. “I believe in this squad,” he said. “The squad is '
            'good enough to turn this round. We need to, we don’t want it to '
            'fester.”\n',

{'article': 'Another day, another giant leap for women’s rugby and the '

            'not having played an international for more than two years, this '

            'won 15 Tests in a row and cemented their world No 1 ranking '
            'before next year’s delayed World Cup. Only one of these two teams '
            'will be gleefully awaiting the second Test in Northampton next '
            'weekend.\n'
            'It might sound greedy to suggest England should have scored more '
            'than seven tries but they had the chances to do so. By the end, '
            'though, they had inflicted the biggest defeat the Black Ferns '
            'have suffered – the previous record margin was 21-7 against '
            'England a decade ago – and showcased both the fitness of the home '
            'forwards and their increasing depth behind the scrum. The '
            'eye-catching outcome was even achieved despite the pre-match loss '
            'of their vice-captain, Amber Reed, who tweaked a hamstring in '
            'training, and the injured Emily Scarratt, with virtually every '
            'area of the team contributing. Abbie Ward scored the first two '
            'tries and had a third disallowed while Abby Dow and Ellie '
            'Kildunne were a constant attacking handful. Zoe Harrison also had '
            'a good game at fly-half to earn the player of the match award, '
            'assisted by the crisp passing of her half-back partner Claudia '
            'MacDonald and a strong all-round display from the inside centre '
            'Lagi Tuima. It was not quite how New Zealand had planned to mark '
            'their 100th Test but a healthy crowd of almost 10,000 enjoyed it '
            'hugely on a bright, breezy afternoon. One could tell the locals '
            'were up for it by the length of the pre-match pasty queues but '
            'this was West Country rugby with a refreshing twist. A female DJ '
            'on the decks in the main stand, uninhibited dancing in the '
            'aisles, some stirring anthem-singing and, even more unusually, an '
            'English rugby team leading New Zealand 17-0 at half-time. At '
            'least some of that could just catch on permanently.\n'
            'It did no harm that England made a near-perfect start playing '
            'into the stiff, swirling breeze. Given the chance, they have '
            'impressive pace out wide and a lovely flick-on under pressure '
            'from Kildunne allowed Ward to release the surging Dow. The winger '
            'was finally halted 10 metres out but a pop pass off the floor set '
            'Ward galloping clear to the line. The strong-running lock’s '
            'second try was finished from slightly closer range but again '
            'involved Dow making rapid index-linked gains down the left. On a '
            'tricky day for every kicker Harrison’s conversion was a '
            'well-judged beauty and the pressure being applied to the Black '
            'Ferns’ malfunctioning line-out by the athletic Zoe Aldcroft was '
            'similarly helpful. New Zealand simply could not win enough ball '
            'to unleash their dangerous winger Ayesha Leti-l’iga and, with '
            'half-time looming, there was a third English try to admire. The '
            'tackling was generous but there was no doubting the elusive '
            'spirit that helped the 22-year-old Harlequin Kildunne weave her '
            'way to the line. England went off the boil slightly in a '
            'sometimes niggly third quarter but they were not finished. After '
            'Lark Davies had scored from a close-range maul, there was a '
            'lovely debut try for Holly Aitchison, and Dow then scooped up a '
            'loose ball to outpace the cover again. Despite a late score from '
            'Stacey Fluhler, adding to Alana Bremner’s earlier touchdown, it '
            'was Harrison who had the final word to seal England’s first win '

            '2017. Small wonder the delighted Red Roses coach, Simon '

{'article': 'Six years ago, as the Paris accord was agreed amid euphoria at '
            'the 21st UN climate conference, the French hosts wisely insisted '
            'on a clause obliging countries to match promises with deeds. '
            'Having committed to try to hold global temperature rises “well '
            'below” 2C compared to preindustrial times – and aspire towards a '
            'limit of 1.5C – governments were mandated to produce updated '
            'plans in 2020, showing how they would actually achieve that goal. '
            'Delayed by a year due to the Covid pandemic, the climate summit '
            'now beginning in Glasgow represents that moment of truth. In the '
            'words of Laurent Fabius, the former French foreign minister who '
            'presided in Paris, Cop26 “is the Cop of action, at which we apply '
            'the Paris agreement”. Boris Johnson has acknowledged that there '
            'is no prospect of a formal commitment to the 1.5C threshold in '
            'Glasgow. But if a pathway to that target is not kept open, the '
            'world’s leaders will knowingly be locking the planet into a '
            'journey towards environmental catastrophe. This year’s extreme '
            'weather events – the terrible heatwaves, wildfires and floods '
            'that have made headlines across the globe – are evidence that the '
            'destructive consequences of global heating are happening faster '
            'than expected and on a larger scale. The world today is 1.1-1.2C '
            'hotter than in the preindustrial era. Heating beyond 1.5C would '
            'deliver even more devastating droughts and crop failures. It '
            'would increase the chances of greater famine and ecosystem '
            'collapse. There are some signs that the politics of this '
            'existential crisis are finally shifting in the right direction. '
            'Joe Biden’s $555bn climate mitigation plan, the largest part of '
            'his latest Build Back Better proposal, is a start. The president '
            'will have to do more for the US to play a leading global role in '
            'cutting emissions. China, by far the world’s biggest emitter of '
            'greenhouse gases, has pledged to cease funding coal-fired '
            'projects abroad and committed to net zero emissions by 2060. '
            'President Xi Jinping has also set an interim peak emissions '
            'target of 2030. The European Union has proposed new legislation '
            'on industrial emissions, transport and carbon-intensive imports, '
            'designed to cut emissions to 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. These '
            'moves reflect a belated sense of urgency; but time is running out '
            'in the race to close the gap between the total emissions cuts '
            'proposed by countries and the level actually required. For the '
            '1.5C target to remain achievable, global greenhouse gas emissions '
            'need to be almost halved by 2030. According to the UN, the '
            'combined national climate plans of the 197 countries represented '
            'in Glasgow do not get anywhere near that. From countries such as '
            'Russia and India, which have yet to commit to net zero, far more '
            'is needed. Cop26 is unlikely to produce the drama of a '
            'Paris-style breakthrough; but it must pave the way for concerted '
            'global action to speed up emissions cuts. Concrete measures are '
            'required in areas such as phasing out coal, reducing methane gas '
            'emissions, preserving carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands, '
            'and financing climate mitigation in developing nations. Britain, '
            'as the hosts of Cop26, will hold the ring over the next two '
            'weeks. It is, to say the least, unfortunate that as Mr Johnson '
            'bangs the drum for countries to take more action, his own '
            'government is blithely proceeding with new oilfield licensing in '
            'the North Sea. It is precisely this kind of gap between rhetoric '
            'and action that must be addressed in Glasgow, if the conference '
            'is to be judged a success. There is no longer any wriggle room '
            'left. What is done and left undone this decade will determine the '
            'fate of future generations. As a UN pre-summit statement starkly '
            'concluded last week: “Eight years to make the plans, put in place '
            'the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The '
            'clock is ticking loudly.”',

{'article': 'The pandemic has broken many things, and among them are habits of '
            'a lifetime. Some people forged new norms, and discovered in '
            'lockdown new routines (working from home, gardening, baking, '
            'exercise, petcare), a tendency only underlined by the '
            'repetitiveness of the days themselves. The evident popularity of '
            'some new habits, such as cycling, will persist. Repeat something '
            'once a day for weeks and it begins to feel automatic – a habit, '
            'in other words. But the scale of the loss is unprecedented. Some '
            'habits were good to lose. It is interesting, for instance, that '
            'breaking the habit of going to badly paid, exploitative jobs has '
            'meant that far fewer people are willing to go back to them, while '
            'others have found respite from drinking or overspending. But many '
            'would be missed, especially the habit of spending time with '
            'others (including family and friends); the habit of enjoying art '
            '– going to the cinema, galleries and, for believers, the habit of '
            'worship. Pre-Covid about 15 million people a month went to the '
            'cinema, while London theatres attracted the same number every '
            'year. Then all of these places went dark. Now they are open '
            'again, the challenge is to see whether those routines can be '
            'rebuilt. At the most basic level, we need habits in order to '
            'cope. “The skeleton of habit alone,” wrote Virginia Woolf in her '
            'X-ray of 1920s English high society, Mrs Dalloway, “upholds the '
            'human frame.” Almost two centuries before, the philosopher David '
            'Hume argued that “custom … is the great guide of human life. It … '
            'makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with '
            'those which have appeared in the past.” The repetition of cause '
            'and effect builds our trust in the world, in other words, and, '
            'further, builds a world as it does so; breaking habits breaks '
            'that world. This insight has been buttressed by recent empirical '
            'research. Neuroscientists suggest humans are on autopilot up to '
            '43% of the time. Wendy Wood, a professor of social psychology and '
            'author of Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive '
            'Changes That Stick argues that one reason lockdown was so '
            'unsettling was because it threw everyone back into full decision '
            'mode. Aspects of the world were broken, and we had to rewire '
            'them. There are of course many types of habit, from those '
            'acquired through deliberate practice (playing a musical '
            'instrument) to those succumbed to (gambling); those acquired '
            'through social responsibility (mask-wearing), or those partly '
            'social but also driven by an intangible need for something deeper '
            'and richer (theatre-going). Some newly acquired obsessions might '
            'be better for the human spirit than previously acknowledged: last '
            'year, researchers at the University of Oxford reported the surge '
            'in playing video games in lockdown could be good for mental '
            'health. The good news is that, for the most part, we can actively '
            'choose to remake habits we want or need. More than 10 million '
            'people went to the cinema in August. A festival of musical '
            'theatre in London attracted thousands. Putting to one side, for a '
            'short hopeful moment, the current resurgence in Covid cases, this '
            'is surely proof that we can rebuild our worlds, one habit at a '
            'time.',

{'article': 'My mother, Gwyn Singleton, who has died aged 87, was a pioneer of '
            'dyslexia education in the west of Scotland in the 1970s. Born in '
            'Edinburgh, she was raised in Glasgow, where her father, J Mouland '
            'Begbie, was leader of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Her '
            'mother, Ena (nee Davis-Jones) was a primary teacher until she '
            'married. Gwyn attended Laurel Bank school, Glasgow, and despite '
            'early dreams of going to Paris to work in couture, she trained as '
            'a teacher at Jordanhill College, Glasgow, and that became her '
            'lifelong vocation. Her first teaching job was at Haggs Hill '
            'primary school, Glasgow. In 1959 she married Ronald Singleton and '
            'they had four children. She was a full-time mother for several '
            'years. The marriage later ended in divorce. As she rebuilt her '
            'career in the70s, she developed an interest in teaching pupils '
            'with dyslexia – an area of specialism that was radical and new. '
            'With a few others she started and led Dyslexia ScotWest to '
            'provide one-to-one specialist support. She would spend long hours '
            'on the phone comforting and advising distraught mothers who had '
            'no idea how to help their struggling children. After training as '
            'a specialist dyslexia teacher at the Dyslexia Institute in '
            'Scotland, Gwyn went back to full-time teaching in schools in '
            'Edinburgh and Glasgow. Like many women of her generation, she '
            'felt that she had missed out by not going to university and so '
            'completed an Open University degree in education, graduating in '
            'the late 1980s. Through the OU she met David Moseley, who became '
            'her partner for the second half of her life. She moved to '
            'Newcastle and worked at Nunnykirk, a specialist school, until '
            'retiring in 1999. In retirement, she and David worked together on '
            'a spelling dictionary for children with dyslexia, which was '
            'published in several editions. She loved Newcastle and made many '
            'friends there. Her retirement years were busy with music and '

{'article': 'The number of “honour-based” abuse (HBA) offences recorded by '
            'English police forces has soared over the past five years, '
            'figures suggest. According to data from the 28 out of 39 '
            'constabularies that responded to freedom of information (FoI) '
            'requests, the number of HBA cases – including offences such as '
            'rape, death threats and assault – rose from 884 in 2016 to 1,599 '
            'last year, a rise of 81%. While some of the increase in HBA '
            'offences could be down to more victims coming forward and '
            'improved identification of offences by police, Imran Khodabocus, '
            'a senior associate at the Family Law Company who represents '
            'families in such cases, said the rise was alarming. He said: '
            '“It’s essential education around what honour-based abuse is and '
            'how it impacts families is improved across the country. These '
            'figures are likely to just show the tip of the iceberg: lockdowns '
            'have exacerbated the problem for many and as we continue to get '
            'back to normal life, I expect to see even more cases involving '
            'honour-based abuse. “Of course, due to the very nature of these '
            'cases, it’s likely many victims will never even think to approach '
            'the police and the issues are often not recognised by schools, '
            'social services or the police.” Forced marriage and female '
            'genital mutilation (FGM) are other instances of HBA offences '
            'committed, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, “to '
            'protect or defend the honour of an individual, family and/or '
            'community for alleged or perceived breaches of the family and/or '
            'community’s code of behaviour.” There are estimated to be 12 to '
            '15 so-called “honour” killings in Britain every year. Notorious '
            'cases include Banaz Mahmod, whose father, uncle and other '
            'relatives plotted to murder her after she left an allegedly '
            'abusive marriage and fell in love with another man; and Samia '
            'Shahid, from Bradford, who was killed on a trip to Pakistan. '
            'Shahid’s ex-husband and father were arrested in Pakistan in '
            'connection with her death but her father died while on bail and '
            'nobody has stood trial. The Home Office has collected data from '
            'police forces on HBA offences on a mandatory basis since April '
            '2019. Its first figures, described as “experimental”, showed '
            '2,024 offences recorded in 2019-20, although it said as it was '
            'often a “hidden” crime, this was likely to have been a “small '
            'proportion” of offences actually committed. Greater Manchester '
            'police (GMP) were excluded from the Home Office figures because '
            'they could not supply data owing to installation of a new IT '
            'system, and were unable to respond to the FoI request either. '
            'Karma Nirvana, a charity that supports victims of honour-based '
            'violence, said the omission of figures from GMP, England’s third '
            'biggest force, was significant as the area generates a lot of '
            'calls to its helpline. Natasha Rattu, the director of Karma '
            'Nirvana, acknowledged police identification of such crimes was '
            'better, albeit still with room for improvement, but said: “The '
            'fact that there are increases suggests that people are and have '
            'been feeling more desperate or more at risk.” The charity wants a '
            'fresh review of policing of honour-based abuse by HM Inspectorate '
            'of Constabulary as it says many of the recommendations of the '
            'last report, in 2015, which found police were not doing enough to '
            'protect victims, have not been implemented. A National Police '
            'Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “We acknowledge that these '
            'abuses are hugely under-reported and we remain focused on giving '

{'article': 'My father, David Minnikin, who has died aged 81, was a researcher '
            'in the field of mycobacteria – the bacteria that cause diseases '
            'such as tuberculosis. His work identifying the chemical make-up '
            'of the waxy shield around these cells led to new treatments being '

            'chemicals in the cell shield, enabling drugs to be targeted at '
            'them, became known as the “Minnikin method”. David was born in '

            '(nee Telfer), a farmer’s daughter, and Thomas Minnikin, a '
            'gardener. He attended a local school in Corbridge, and sat the '
            'entrance exams to Lord Wandsworth college, in Hampshire, gaining '
            'a scholarship as a boarder. He excelled academically and took a '
            'keen interest in sports. From there he won a scholarship to study '
            'chemistry at Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1963, and '
            'going on to take a DPhil on the chemistry of the lipids of '
            'tubercle bacilli at the Dyson Perrins laboratory in 1967. That '
            'year he became a senior research officer at the inorganic '
            'chemistry department of the University of Newcastle, where he '
            'mentored young researchers and students. He was promoted to '
            'senior lecturer in 1985. His early studies in the 1980s used '
            'specific bacterial lipids as a fingerprint to identify and group '
            'bacteria, in particular antibiotic-producing bacteria. In 1982, '
            'he described the waxy coat of unusual lipids and sugars around '
            'the tuberculosis organism, which provided a shield against common '
            'antibiotics. His subsequent studies based on “the Minnkin model” '
            'identified several new drugs that would weaken this shield, '
            'thereby shaping efforts in drug discovery against tuberculosis. '
            'This is recognised as a landmark in mycobacterial research – and '
            'all carried out before the era of genomics. In 2002 he was '
            'appointed professor of microbial chemistry at Newcastle. The same '
            'year, he moved his research to the University of Birmingham. '
            'There, with Gurdyal Besra, he established a new world-leading '
            'research group on tuberculosis. In his latter years, he developed '
            'a keen interest in tracing the evolution of the same type of '
            'infections, causing leprosy as well as TB. He never really '
            'retired, but officially stepped down from Birmingham university '
            'in 2007. He continued to write papers and chapters for books as '

{'article': 'The T20 World Cup has been played to a very particular '
            'soundtrack. The stadium DJs have been most noticeable, filling '
            'every macroscopic pause in play with overamplified banter and '
            'snippets from a curiously curated playlist – the inclusion of '
            'Mysterious Girl, the 25-year-old Peter Andre hit, in particular '
            'takes some explaining. Those in the ground also have to deal with '
            'constant roaming food and drink hawkers plying their wares, and '
            'then of course there are the fans themselves, who vary enormously '
            'in number and volume depending on their nation. But in England’s '
            'thrilling victory against Australia on Saturday Jos Buttler '
            'inspired another, rarer sound: collective groans of awed '
            'appreciation.\n'
            'It is one that has been heard in Dubai before. “There was '
            'actually a game that we were talking about while he was going '
            'bananas out there, where he scored a 46-ball hundred where very '
            'similarly, he just seemed to hit the middle of the bat over and '
            'over again,” Eoin Morgan said on Saturday night, remembering the '
            'fourth game of a 50-over ODI series in 2015 against Pakistan – a '
            'series played, like this World Cup, in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and '
            'Dubai. “That’s a while ago now but every time you come and play '
            'here there are obviously great memories,” Buttler said. “We were '
            'in the same dressing room as well on that day. It just has a nice '
            'feel about it, remembering that sort of day. So absolutely that '
            'gives you confidence, to know you are coming back to a ground '
            'where you have probably played your best innings.” The first '
            'inkling that Saturday was going to be Buttler’s night occurred in '
            'training 24 hours earlier. “I had a great practice. Some of the '
            'practice wickets have been a bit tricky but on Friday I managed '
            'to have some great practice,” he said. “I think all the batsmen '
            'enjoyed it. It’s nice to put your hands through a few, have some '
            'fun and freedom. I had a lot of fun at practice and took that '
            'into the game today.”\n'
            'The confidence the 31‑year‑old gained in that session flowed '
            'straight into Saturday night’s match, an innings that reached its '
            'apogee in the sixth over when two Mitchell Starc deliveries were '
            'deposited just a few seats away from each other in the top tier '
            'of the stands. “Practise it and the confidence stays,” he said. '
            '“Adrenaline is going but you’re still trying to remain quite '
            'level in your brain and sort of relaxed in the top half. When '
            'guys are bowling fast, you have that level of adrenaline. We got '
            'to the fifth over with no wickets down and that allows you a '
            'licence really to attack.” After seeing him hit 71 runs off 32 '
            'balls, Liam Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure to just sit '
            'there and watch a genius at work.” Livingstone said Buttler was '
            '“the best hitter of a white ball in the world”, a description '
            'echoed by Adil Rashid. “He’s done that many a time over the '
            'years,” Rashid said. “It’s the variety of shots he’s got, the '
            'power he’s got, the fearlessness, putting bowlers under pressure. '
            'All this combined makes him one of the best white-ball batsmen in '
            'the world.” Buttler’s innings helped to establish England’s '
            'superiority in Group One of the Super 12s not just on points but '
            'also, and by a massive margin, on net run rate, their three '
            'successful run chases having been polished off with 34, 35 and '
            'then 50 balls to spare. With two games remaining, starting '
            'against Sri Lanka in Sharjah on Monday, their position in the '
            'semi-finals already looks secured, but the players insist there '
            'will be no loss of focus. “That’s part and parcel of the job, '
            'that’s what we are required to do as cricketers and professional '
            'sportsmen,” said Rashid. “Our mindset is exactly the same whoever '
            'we play against, there won’t be anything different. We don’t look '
            'too far ahead, we don’t think about winning the World Cup. That '
            'is still a long way away. We’re just thinking about the next '
            'game, which is Sri Lanka, and doing the job there, and then next '
            'game from there. We won’t look too far ahead and think about the '
            'final and stuff.”',

{'article': 'After roaming the high seas for four days as Greece and Turkey '
            'haggled over its fate, a cargo ship packed with hundreds of '
            'Afghan refugees has been allowed to dock at an Aegean island, '
            'with passengers disembarking to apply for asylum. In what '
            'Greece’s migration ministry called “an unusual and special case”, '
            'the Turkish-flagged vessel was towed into the port of Kos on '
            'Sunday. About 375 passengers, the biggest single influx of asylum '
            'seekers in years, were taken to a reception centre on the island. '
            'Six others were detained for questioning and one woman was '
            'admitted to hospital on the island of Karpathos. Greek coastguard '
            'officials said those onboard were mostly young Afghan males. Many '
            'were reported to be hungry and dehydrated after an ordeal that '
            'began on Thursday when the freighter, initially bound for Italy, '
            'developed engine trouble and sent out a distress signal off the '
            'island of Crete, shortly after setting sail from Turkey. Days of '
            'negotiations between Athens and Ankara followed after the Greek '
            'government appealed via the European Commission for Turkey to '
            'take the vessel back in line with a 2016 accord reached with the '
            'EU intended to staunch migrants flows. When the Turkish '
            'authorities made clear they would not be accepting the ship, '
            'Greek coastguard officials launched what they called one of the '
            'largest search and rescue operations in the eastern '
            'Mediterranean. The country’s minister for migration and asylum '
            'policy, Notis Mitarachi, described the incident as “another '
            'dangerous and illegal journey from the Turkish coast … '
            'facilitated by criminal gangs”. He said on Sunday: “We have '
            'notified the EU that Turkey has refused to take their vessel '
            'back. Greece has rescued hundreds of thousands of people in the '
            'last seven years. It is time for the EU to act and provide '
            'impactful solidarity and ensure the [2016] EU/Turkey statement is '
            'upheld. “Unlike Turkey and others that ignored the problem, '
            'Greece stepped up, providing immediate humanitarian support to '
            'people in need as we always do. But Greece cannot solve the '
            'migration crisis alone.”\n'
            'Numbers have dropped precipitously but Athens and Ankara have '
            'been in a war of words over migrant arrivals. Since the Taliban’s '
            'takeover of Afghanistan in August, fears have mounted among EU '
            'states of a replay of the 2015 refugee crisis when almost 1 '
            'million Syrians streamed into Europe via Lesbos and other '
            'frontline Aegean islands. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of '
            'forcibly returning boats crammed with asylum seekers into Turkish '
            'waters by pursuing a policy of pushbacks, and has invited the '
            'international media to witness such incidents. Athens has charged '
            'Turkish authorities with deliberately escalating tension by '
            'encouraging smugglers to organise the illicit journeys. The NGO '
            'Aegean Boat Report said Greek authorities were made aware through '
            'local media reports that the cargo ship was in distress, but that '
            'they held off confirming the incident, raising fears that another '
            'pushback was under way. None of those onboard wanted to return to '
            'Turkey because they did not consider it a safe country, the '
            'organisation said.',

{'article': 'David Davis’s recent article (Be warned: this government is '
            'robbing you of your right to challenge the state, 25 October) '
            'labels the government’s proposed reforms to judicial review “an '
            'obvious attempt to avoid accountability”. While the specific '
            'changes in clauses 1 and 2 of the current bill are actually '
            'relatively narrow and technical, I share his concerns about the '
            'attitude they reveal. Recent government statements demonstrate '
            'that the bill is only the opening skirmish in an effort to shield '
            'government power from legitimate oversight. The government frames '
            'its desire to curb judicial review as correcting an illegitimate '
            'political power grab against elected legislators by unelected '
            'judges. In fact, the government seeks to arrogate more power to '
            'itself. Judicial review exists to enable independent courts to '
            'act as parliament’s watchdog and ensure that public bodies abide '
            'by the law and interpret it correctly. The legal questions raised '
            'are “political” insofar as all wielding of state power is '
            'political, but judicial review is not about second-guessing '
            'policy choices, it is rather about upholding legislation. A '
            'judge’s role is to check whether decisions are within the '
            'decision-maker’s legal power and rationally made, following the '
            'proper procedures. If the government wants to modify the laws and '
            'procedures in question it is free to do so, but until that '
            'happens the courts require public bodies to obey the law as it '
            'stands. A significant curtailment of judicial review would place '
            'the government and public bodies above the law. Although Davis '

{'article': 'My mother, Daphne Heiser, who has died aged 100, was a teacher of '
            'languages and promoter of international friendship who received '
            'an honour from Spain. Born and brought up in Cricklewood, '
            'north-west London, Daphne was one of three children of Michael '
            'Landau, a scientist and metallurgist, and Florrie (nee Dancyger), '
            'in a Jewish family with a tradition of female scholarship, not '
            'common at the time. Two of Daphne’s aunts were headteachers, '
            'including Annie Landau, head of the Evelina de Rothschild school '
            'in Jerusalem. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist, was a cousin. '
            'Daphne’s father died in 1933 when she was almost 12, probably due '
            'to contact with radioactive materials, after which her mother '
            'worked as an administrator at Cricklewood synagogue. From '
            'Brondesbury and Kilburn high school Daphne went to King’s College '
            'London, where she studied French and Spanish. After graduation, '
            'she undertook a year’s teaching training, also at KCL. In 1945 '
            'she met Albert Heiser through the Labour party, and they were '
            'married in three years later. They moved to Peterborough in 1953, '
            'and she lived there for most of the rest of her life. Daphne '
            'taught at a variety of schools, notably Peterborough county '
            'girls’ school. A dedicated and enthusiastic languages teacher, '
            'she is remembered by past pupils for her good classroom '
            'management and the hard work she expected from them. She made '
            'contacts with schools abroad and paired up the pupils with '
            'pen-friends, organising school exchanges, spending weeks of her '
            'holidays abroad with the students, providing hospitality and '
            'putting on a programme of outings on the return visits. She took '
            'career breaks when my sister and I were born in the late 50s, and '
            'when we lived in Brazil and Spain, due to our father’s job as an '
            'engineer. As a proponent of immersive language teaching, she '
            'thought nothing of sending us to local schools, where we were '
            'taught in Portuguese, then Spanish. Daphne was a keen promoter of '
            'town-twinning and was active in establishing Peterborough’s links '
            'with Alcalá de Henares in Spain and Bourges in France. She was a '
            'co-opted member of the city council’s twinning committee. She was '
            'also president of the Peterborough Hispanic Society and active in '
            'the Anglo-French association. In recognition of her work '
            'promoting ties with Spain, in 2012 she was appointed Encomienda '
            '(Commander) of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the king and '

{'article': 'The clocks have gone back and we seem to have returned to the '
            'recent past when Saracens ruled the roost in the English club '
            'game. They are back after their year in exile from the '
            'Premiership and with a vengeance. On the previous two Sundays '
            'they had gorged themselves on 126 points in wins against Bath and '
            'Wasps. This time, though, Saracens escaped to victory, coming '
            'from behind to win the game with a late try from Jackson Wray.\n'
            'It was the champions Harlequins’ first home Premiership defeat of '
            'the year and they will wonder how this one got away after they '
            'had led 19-9 at the break with an autumn gale behind them. They '
            'were eventually blown away by a match-winning display by Alex '
            'Lozowski, stepping in for Owen Farrell at fly-half, who scored 19 '
            'points in another peerless display. “I think we were second-best '
            'for much of the game. We really had to dig in there,” he said. '
            'With international call-ups robbing the fixture of a few star '
            'names, Danny Care, long ago considered surplus to requirements by '
            'Eddie Jones, was handed the Harlequins captaincy while Lozowski '
            'was back in a position in which he had looked so at home in the '
            'opening fixture at Bristol. Care’s half-back partner Tommy Allan '
            'was soon the victim of a late challenge by Vincent Koch. The '
            'ensuing penalty gave Quins the platform to launch an attack that '
            'gave the young lock Hugh Tizard the chance to finish for the '
            'first try of the afternoon. It was the perfect start for Quins '
            'but they soon conceded a couple of soft penalties, one of them '
            'converted by Lozowski. Allan did not seem too affected from that '
            'early hit by Koch and the Italy international soon set up a '
            'second try. From a ruck Allan’s wonderful long pass to Tom Lawday '
            'gave the No 8 the opportunity to set up the wing Cadan Murley for '
            'the chance to break Alex Goode’s tackle and score in the corner. '
            'The physicality of the match was unrelenting. Allan soon left the '
            'field for a head injury assessment he failed and was replaced by '
            'Will Edwards, a former England sevens player who does not lack '
            'pace but probably did not expect too much time on the field. '
            'Lozowski continued to chip away at the Quins lead but when a '
            'Saracens move broke down in midfield, the flanker Jack Kenningham '
            'took advantage to plough upfield, would‑be tacklers bouncing off '
            'him. He gave Lawday another chance to set up a try after he had '
            'given a firm hand‑off to Koch. Lawday’s pass to Tyrone Green, who '
            'was looking razor-sharp at full‑back, glided over in the corner '
            'for a third try. Dino Lamb, the Quins lock, was sent to the '
            'sin-bin for clearing out a maul a little too enthusiastically but '
            'the champions led by 10 points at the break. The question was '
            'would that be enough with the strong wind behind the visitors in '
            'the second half. There was a scare when Dom Morris cashed in with '
            'a sharp try against a side still handicapped by Lamb’s absence '
            'but Quins replied with a smart drop-goal by Care. It was his '
            'eighth drop-goal, the most by any Premiership No 9. The momentum '
            'was back with the home side and the crowd found its voice. '
            'Stephan Lewies, who had led Quins to their title but has been out '
            'of the side with a foot injury, made a welcome return to bolster '
            'the home pack. Edwards struck an upright with a penalty before '
            'Lozowski converted successfully at the other end to reduce the '
            'deficit to three points. Saracens won a penalty at the breakdown '
            'through good work by Wray. Lozowski was having one of those days '
            'and Saracens were level. There was a sting in the tail. Four '
            'minutes from time Saracens moved the ball wide, Lozowski '
            'straightened the line and Alex Lewington slipped a pass for Wray '
            'to squeeze over in the corner. Inevitably Lozowski converted from '
            'the touchline. The only downside for Saracens was the sight of '
            'Billy Vunipola hobbling off with a knee injury in the last '
            'minute.',

{'article': 'My friend Simon Zukas, who has died aged 96, first became '
            'prominent in the political life of Northern Rhodesia (later '
            'Zambia) in 1951, as one of the founders and leaders of a radical, '
            'and predominantly African, committee that opposed the '
            'establishment of the settler-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and '
            'Nyasaland. In April 1952 the colonial government, holding that he '
            'was “a danger to peace and good order”, sought to deport him to '
            'the UK, a country with which he had no connection. He was held in '
            'prison in Livingstone for eight months and was then removed to '
            'London in December 1952. Appeals against his deportation, which '
            'went as far as the privy council, failed. Born in Ukmergė, '
            'Lithuania, the son of Chaim and Libe Zukas, Simon had arrived in '
            'Northern Rhodesia with his family in July 1938, a few days before '
            'his 13th birthday. His father had left Lithuania in 1936 with no '
            'foreknowledge of the catastrophe that was soon to strike the '
            'Jewish population. Simon arrived in Ndola speaking only Yiddish '
            'and Lithuanian, but he was soon top of the class. Within five '
            'years he had won a scholarship to study civil engineering at the '
            'University of Cape Town. He volunteered to do wartime military '
            'service and spent three years with African troops in East Africa. '
            'Taking up his university place in 1947, he became a radical '
            'socialist. He was close to, though not then a member of, the '
            'Communist party of South Africa. In exile in London from 1953, he '
            'became a co-founder of the Movement for Colonial Freedom and was '
            'from 1960 a member of the London committee of the United National '
            'Independence party (UNIP). He met and in 1954 married Cynthia '
            'Robinson, a South African artist, and set up a successful civil '
            'engineering consultancy. He was given a hero’s welcome on his '
            'return to Zambia before independence in 1964. For more than 20 '
            'years he devoted himself to civil engineering and commercial '
            'farming, but in 1990, disillusioned with the one-party state and '
            'Zambia’s economic decline, he became a founder of the Movement '
            'for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD). Following the defeat of '
            'President Kenneth Kaunda and UNIP in 1991, he joined the new '
            'government and served as minister of agriculture and then public '
            'works. He resigned in 1996 over a matter of principle relating to '
            'the political rights of immigrants and their children, but '
            'returned to politics in 2001 as one of a group, the Oasis Forum, '
            'that successfully opposed Frederick Chiluba’s attempt to secure '
            'an unconstitutional third presidential term. He then became chair '
            'of a new opposition party, the Forum for Democracy and '
            'Development (FDD), stepping down in 2005. He never, however, '
            'retired from political life. Ten days before his death, he led a '
            'deputation of elders to call upon the newly elected president, '
            'Hakainde Hichilema. Always committed to democracy, he welcomed '
            'Zambia’s third change of government through the ballot box. His '
            'state funeral was marked by a day of national mourning. He is '

            'grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.',

            'anti-racist groups and frontline activists from the global south, '
            'launched its campaign just a few hundred metres from the official '

            'over the edge and if we want to stop that spiralling out of '
            'control we have to act right now, in this decade.” Rehman said '
            'the climate crisis was already wreaking havoc in every country '
            'and was a result of a system that exploited people and resources '
            'for the benefit of a few. “Even today in the corridors of power '
            'in the negotiations our governments are making decisions which '
            'basically say the lives of black, brown and indigenous people, of '
            'the poor and of women, are not worth saving … and the priority is '
            'the extraction of profit.” Rehman said the challenge facing '
            'campaigners was to build solidarity between climate justice '
            'movements in the global south and north and to highlight the '
            'connections between various interlinked crises, from inequality '
            'to racism, climate breakdown to sexism. “We must tell a story of '
            'the world we want to create … that is not just about a just '
            'transition but a justice transition, not just about cutting '
            'carbon but cutting injustice,” he said. The Greenpeace ship the '

            'hit hardest by the climate crisis, will attempt to sail up the '

{'article': 'The poet Brendan Kennelly, who has died aged 85, invited readers '
            'to embrace and understand their polar opposites. His most '
            'ambitious and controversial work, Cromwell (1983), addressed the '
            'archetypal enemy of his native Ireland – Oliver Cromwell as '
            'commander of the English campaign there in 1649-50 – '
            'empathetically. The Book of Judas (1991), a 400-page work that '
            'was a bestseller in Ireland, suggested that the classic traitor '
            'had loved, and indeed created, the man whom he betrayed with a '
            'kiss. This insistence on acknowledging “the Other” marked a '
            'reaction to “the obscenity of labelling people” and the need for '
            'the “violation of inherited prejudices”. Kennelly insisted that '
            '“Irish people must become English imaginatively, Protestants '
            'become Catholics and men become women”. In selecting five poems '
            'to render into Greek, the translator Vera Konidari told me that '
            'she settled on ones that formed “a sort of confession of a man '
            'who tries to come to terms with conflicts, his language, the past '
            'which merges with the present. It represents a spiritual '
            'journey.” With regard to his most anthologised poem, My Dark '
            'Fathers, Kennelly himself told me: “Poetry is written by blind '
            'men groping for the light” – here, evoking the silencing of '
            'spontaneous artistic expression by the famine that followed the '
            'failure of the Irish potato crop in the 1840s: Upon the headland, '
            'the encroaching sea Left sand that hardened after tides of '
            'Spring, No dancing feet disturbed its symmetry And those who '
            'loved good music ceased to sing. His sense of quest and '
            'confession was particularly vivid for those who heard his public '
            'readings. Kennelly was both a sensualist, revelling in the '
            'erotic, exotic and extravagant in the natural world, and also '
            'acted as a social conscience: for many Irish people in an era of '
            'radical social transformation, he symbolised the transition from '
            'rural to urban life. He could relish the city of Dublin, but '
            'always in the light of the enduring qualities of village life, '
            'imprinted during childhood and adolescence. Born in '
            'Ballylongford, near Listowel, Co Kerry, Brendan was the son of '
            'Bridie (nee Ahern), a nurse, and Timmie Kennelly, a publican. The '
            'inspiration and perspective of the hamlet in south-west Ireland '
            'remained a world of intensities, as brought out in My Dark '
            'Fathers. Kennelly was educated locally before winning a '
            'scholarship to Trinity College Dublin. After some hesitation – '
            'working as a clerk in the Electricity Supply Board and as a bus '
            'conductor in London – he gained a degree in English and French '
            'from TCD (1961), and studied with Derry (Norman) Jeffares at '
            'Leeds University, where he took a PhD with a thesis on modern '
            'Irish poets and the Irish epic. He started working as a lecturer '
            'at TCD in 1963. As professor of modern literature (1973-2005) at '
            'TCD he won the affection of students – among them long-term '
            'prisoners in Irish jails – for his wide-ranging and uninhibited '
            'approach to the subject. A Kennelly lecture was an occasion, an '
            'idiosyncratic performance of deeply felt humanity, humour and '
            'compassion. His work as a critic, including his masterly essay on '
            'WB Yeats, An Experiment in Living, appeared in the collection '
            'Journey Into Joy (1994). He held visiting professorships in the '
            'US and the Netherlands, and served three terms as chairman of '
            'Ireland’s Cultural Relations Committee, promoting the country’s '
            'culture abroad. To mark his 85th birthday earlier this year, TCD '
            'launched the Brendan Kennelly Literary Archive. In 1969 he '
            'married Peggy O’Brien, who had come to Dublin as a student from '
            'Massachusetts, and they had a daughter, Doodle (Kristen). The '
            'breakdown of the marriage and his subsequent treatment for '
            'alcoholism led him into translations of Federico García Lorca’s '
            'Blood Wedding (1996) and of classic texts, Medea, Antigone and '
            'The Trojan Women, published as When Then Is Now (2006). In these '
            'Kennelly gave full voice to the rage of women betrayed, belittled '
            'and degraded, who not merely assert the strengths of their '
            'womanhood but state their otherness to the prevailing male '
            'orthodoxy. Woman became for him the centre of both beauty and '
            'anger. Yet Kennelly never overcame his own fear of women, which '
            'he attributed to the Catholic upbringing that insisted that woman '
            'was “an occasion of sin”. In writing as in sport – he was a good '
            'footballer – Kennelly displayed grace under pressure. Heart '
            'bypass surgery in 1996 left him physically frail and increasingly '
            'withdrawn. Yet emotionally and imaginatively he continued '
            'thirsting for the ecstatic: “I’d like to become a poem,” he told '
            'me, “to become coherent and accomplished and singing.” One of his '
            'most effective – his signature of affirmation and celebration – '
            'is Begin: Though we live in a world that dreams of ending that '
            'always seems about to give in something that will not acknowledge '
            'conclusion insists that we forever begin. His marriage ended in '
            'divorce in 1987, and Doodle died in April this year. He is '
            'survived by three brothers, two sisters and three grandchildren. '

{'article': 'World leaders meeting at the G20 summit in Rome have agreed that '
            'countries must take meaningful action to keep the world from '
            'warming by no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but are '
            'facing criticism for offering few concrete commitments in order '
            'to reach the target. Sunday’s final communique did not include a '
            'commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The G20 '
            'leaders instead agreed to wording that underlines the importance '
            'of reaching net zero by or around the middle of the century, '
            'phrasing that meets the positions of China and Saudi Arabia. '
            'Greenpeace condemned the statement as weak and “lacking ambition '
            'and vision”, and said G20 leaders had “failed to meet the moment” '
            'before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. “If the G20 was a '
            'dress rehearsal for Cop26, then world leaders fluffed their '
            'lines,” said its executive director, Jennifer Morgan. Tom Burke, '
            'of the E3G thinktank, however, praised the changes in the '
            'language agreed. “This is a shift from what they have previously '
            'said. The crucial words are on this decade. Previously they had '
            'only talked about 2050, which is too far away,” he said. “This is '
            'an expression of a growing sense of urgency in the G20, driven by '
            'both events and science. This is a political signal that will add '
            'momentum to the Cop and help in reaching agreement at Cop. We '
            'were not expecting this language.” The communique does set out '
            'plans to end overseas investment in coal this year – something '
            'China has agreed to do – and to take unspecific actions to limit '
            'domestic coal use. Objections from Turkey to the passage on coal '
            'were lifted early on Sunday morning, leading to a rare outbreak '
            'of cheers from exhausted drafting officials at their first large, '
            'in-person gathering since the start of the Covid pandemic. The '
            'whole of the G20 summit was seen as a test of multilateralism’s '
            'durability after a period in which the world responded to the '
            'pandemic by looking inwards. The communique said: “We will '
            'increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in '
            'Pittsburgh to phase out and rationalise over the medium term '
            'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.” A reference in an earlier '
            'draft to reducing carbon emissions significantly, which Turkey '
            'had opposed, was removed in favour of a phrase saying a reduction '
            'in fossil fuel use is “one of the most feasible, efficient and '
            'quickest ways to limit climate change”. The Italian hosts were '
            'delighted by the outcome, saying they had done “the heavy lifting '
            'for Boris Johnson” and the British hosts in Glasgow. The Italian '
            'prime minister, Mario Draghi, who chaired the G20 summit, '
            'recalling the words of Greta Thunberg at the Youth4Climate '
            'conference in Milan in September, said at the closing press '
            'conference: “Many say they are tired of ‘blah, blah, blah’. I '
            'believe this summit was full of substance. We have filled the '
            'words with substance.” Draghi added: “Now, for the first time, '
            'the whole of the G20 recognises the scientific validity of the '
            'one-and-a-half-degree goal, and they commit themselves with a '
            'sufficiently significant language.” He said: “Something has '
            'changed at this summit. The G20 has rediscovered the ability to '
            'face epochal challenges: Covid-19, climate, health, gender and '
            'wealth inequalities. And all these we have discovered are '
            'challenges that we cannot overcome alone.” Joe Biden said the '
            'summit had shown “the world’s trust in America was back”, adding '
            'that the US had shown up and is now the most critical part of the '
            'agenda. He said he was disappointed that Vladimir Putin, the '
            'Russian president, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, did not '
            'travel to Rome. The US president said: “We’ve made significant '
            'progress [on the climate crisis], and more has to be done, but '
            'it’s going to require us to continue to focus on what China’s not '
            'doing, what Russia is not doing and what Saudi Arabia is not '
            'doing. “We will not switch to renewable energy overnight. No one '
            'had anticipated that this year we would be in a position, or even '
            'next year, that we are not going to use any more oil or gas or we '
            'are not going to be engaged in any more fossil fuels. We are just '
            'going to stop subsidising fossil fuels. “The idea that we are not '
            'going to need gas for automobiles is not realistic, but we will '
            'get to the point where by 2050 we will have zero emissions. The '
            'UN secretary general, António Guterres, was less enthusiastic, '
            'saying: “While I welcome the G20’s commitment to global '
            'solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled but at least '
            'not buried forever.”\n'
            'The climate progress was matched by other agreements over the '
            'weekend on global taxation, ending the US-EU trade dispute and a '
            'commitment to vaccinate 40% of the world’s population against '
            'Covid by the end of the year and 70% by the middle of next year. '
            'The communique calls for countries “to update and advance where '
            'necessary” nationally determined contributions on carbon '
            'emissions this decade, and stresses the importance of fulfilling '
            'the commitment to provide $100bn (£75bn) to help poor countries '
            'adapt to climate change. The UK has acknowledged that Cop26 is '
            'not going to meet the hoped-for $100bn pledge this year. The '
            'language goes just beyond what was agreed six years ago in Paris, '
            'when the climate deal called for capping global warming at well '
            'below 2C, and ideally closer to 1.5C. Experts say it means '
            'halving carbon emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. '
            'China, one of the world’s largest emitters, has said it will meet '
            'net zero by 2060. On the future of coal, the most contentious '
            'issue in framing the agreement, the communique reads: “We will '
            'put an end to the provision of international public finance for '
            'new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021.” In '
            'terms of domestic coal use, the statement contains only a vague '
            'pledge to support those countries that commit to “phasing out '
            'investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity to do '
            'so as soon as possible”.',

            'Evans. Her father came to Britain during the second world war and '

{'article': 'Police in Brazil have killed 25 suspects as part of what '
            'authorities called an unprecedented offensive against heavily '
            'armed bank robbers whose brazen heists have brought several major '
            'cities to a standstill. The alleged criminals were gunned down in '
            'the early hours of Sunday in the south-eastern state of Minas '
            'Gerais, where police claimed they had been poised to unleash an '
            'attack. A report in the local O Tempo newspaper said the killings '
            'took place at two farmhouses in Varginha, a city about 245 miles '
            '(395km) north-west of Rio de Janeiro. “This operation … will go '
            'down in history,” the Minas Gerais state security secretary, '
            'Rogério Greco, told local radio. The federal highway police, '
            'which took part in the mission, said the group had “a veritable '
            'military arsenal” including assault rifles, .50-caliber machine '
            'guns, explosives and bulletproof vests. Layla Brunella, the '
            'spokesperson for Minas Gerais’s military police force, said the '
            'alleged robbers belonged to Brazil’s “modern-day cangaço” – a '
            'reference to the bands of outlaws who roamed the country’s '
            'north-eastern backlands in the early 20th century under the '
            'leadership of a highwayman called Lampião. “I can tell you this '
            'is the country’s biggest ever operation targeting the ‘modern-day '
            'cangaço’,” Brunella said. Cangaço-style gangs have been '
            'responsible for a series of raids in Brazil in recent years, '
            'often targeting banks in mid-sized cities in the interior of '
            'southern and southeastern states. In December 2020, gangsters '
            'laid siege to the southern city of Criciúma, torching vehicles, '
            'kidnapping government employees, blowing up a bank and engaging '
            'in a two-hour gun battle as the mayor implored residents to stay '
            'off the streets. In August there was a similar attack in the city '
            'of Araçatuba in São Paulo state, as black-clad criminals raided '
            'banks before fleeing with hostages strapped to the roofs of their '
            'getaway vehicles. Police claimed that those killed on Sunday had '
            'been plotting a similar assault in the coming days before they '
            'were tracked down with the help of intelligence. “Minas Gerais is '
            'most certainly not a good place to commit crime,” said Greco, '
            'congratulating the security forces for their “sensational” '
            'actions. Supporters of Brazil’s rightwing president, Jair '
            'Bolsonaro, celebrated the shootings in bellicose terms. “Today '
            '[the police] carried out a historic clean-up,” tweeted Junio '
            'Amaral, a police captain turned congressman who is part of a '
            'growing number of security agents catapulted into Brazilian '
            'politics by public angst over violent crime. Bolsonaro, a pro-gun '
            'populist with significant support in the security forces, was '
            'elected in 2018 pledging to use hardline tactics to bring law and '
            'order to a country that records tens of thousands of murders each '
            'year. Criminals should “die in the streets like cockroaches”, '
            'Bolsonaro declared shortly after taking office, calling for '
            'legislation that would provide protection from prosecution to '
            'security forces and “upstanding citizens” who shot suspects. Last '
            'year police killed more than 6,400 people, the overwhelming '
            'majority young black men. Almost 200 police officers were killed, '
            'a 10% rise compared with the previous year.',

{'article': 'Finn Caldwell is studying four performers perched in the back of '
            'a boat. Together, they are manipulating an enormous puppet, the '
            'Royal Bengal tiger known as Richard Parker in Life of Pi, Yann '
            'Martel’s Booker prize-winning novel, now brought to the stage in '
            'a mesmerising production by Max Webster. “Has anyone got a spare '
            'hand for a foot?” he asks. There isn’t an easy answer. One of '
            'them is holding the creature’s spine. One is swishing its tail '
            'and handling its hind legs. A third is moving the animal’s front '
            'paws and a fourth – Habib Nasib Nader, the tiger’s voice – is '
            'keeping the head high and the jaw moving. To coordinate them is a '
            'strategic balancing act. Every muscle needs a hand to move it. '
            'They are working on the scene where Pi, shipwrecked and adrift '
            'between south-east India and Mexico, discovers the ravenous tiger '
            'can speak. From the other end of the life raft, the animal reels '
            'off a sumptuous litany of dishes: “Boeuf bourguignon, tripe and '
            'calf brains in a brown butter jus, roast suckling pig…” With each '
            'dish comes a gesture. With each gesture, a finely honed ballet of '
            'joints and limbs. Caldwell takes the performers through the '
            'speech, phrase by phrase, beat by beat, with exacting detail. '
            '“When you say, ‘Stay up,’ are you talking to me specifically?” '
            'asks Nader. “No, the puppet,” says Caldwell. You can understand '
            'the confusion. They are four people playing one character and, as '
            'movement director, he must make them breathe as one.\n'
            '“When you operate in a team, you get to the point where you think '
            'everybody else’s ideas are better,” Caldwell says. “You think '
            'everyone else is doing it because, somehow, it’s happening '
            'between you.” He adds: “One of the things that feels live about '
            'the animal is the audience don’t know what it’s going to do – and '
            'the actors don’t know either. Because there are at least three '
            'people operating the tiger, the choreography is going to be '
            'delivered slightly differently every night. There is this frisson '
            'of uncertainty and that makes it very live.” Even here, in this '
            'London rehearsal room without lights or costumes, it is '
            'impossible to take your eyes off Richard Parker. Designed by '
            'Caldwell and Nick Barnes, the tiger is a floating jigsaw of '
            'weather-worn joints in sun-blushed orange. He is not real yet he '
            'seems to breathe. “You know it’s some wood, plastic and people, '
            'but you invest in it and it happens in your head,” says Caroline '
            'Bowman, associate puppet designer, who sculpted most of the '
            'show’s many animal heads. “The more you commit to it, the more '
            'beautiful it is.” It is a leap of imagination that pays emotional '
            'dividends for the audience. “People feel they’ve brought it to '
            'life, so they’re responsible for it,” says Barnes. “When it '
            'hurts, you feel it. When it has joy, you feel it too.” He points '
            'to the independent movement of each of the tiger’s joints, '
            'secured by bungee rope to the spine, making it elastic and '
            'responsive. “As it rises, you can see one piece going against '
            'another,” he says. “You can really identify the movement. If this '
            'was all one thing, half of that movement would be lost. You '
            'wouldn’t get the language of the muscle.” Caldwell, who worked '
            'with Handspring puppet company on War Horse and partnered with '
            'Barnes on The Lorax and Angels in America, describes cats as '
            '“stretchy accordions”. By basing the puppets on real animal '
            'anatomy, they have built that feline flexibility into Richard '
            'Parker: “When it jumps it elongates and then it can really '
            'compress.”\n'
            'It took a team of eight to build the puppets and a week for the '
            'puppeteers to get used to them. The project could have gone badly '
            'wrong. On its voyage to the stage, a hallucinatory tale of 227 '
            'days at sea could easily have drifted off course. “I had no idea '
            'how to do it,” says designer Tim Hatley. “And that’s what '
            'appealed.” But their efforts have already paid off. On its '
            'premiere two years ago at the Crucible in Sheffield, Life of Pi '
            'raked in the five-star reviews. Whether it was Hiran Abeysekera’s '
            'light-footed performance in the lead role, Lolita Chakrabarti’s '
            'theatrically savvy adaptation or Hatley’s magically porous set, '
            'everything clicked into place. Had it not been for the pandemic, '
            'its West End transfer to Wyndham’s theatre, where they’ve '
            'reconfigured the stage to thrust into the stalls, would have come '
            'much sooner. “We got standing ovations even from our roughest '
            'preview,” says Caldwell. “By the fifth time that happened, I '
            'thought, regardless of how much work is in front of me, the '
            'response from the audience is different from anything I’d seen '
            'before.”\n'
            'For director Max Webster, the puppets do two things. First, they '
            'appeal to the same childhood instinct that made us turn lollipop '
            'sticks into people and bananas into telephones. Second, they '
            'connect directly to a key theme in Martel’s book. “When theatre '
            'becomes hallucinatorily wonderful, it is because you’ve got a '
            'group of people collectively imagining a thing, which creates an '
            'act of imagination in the audience,” he says. “That is also what '
            'the Pi story is about. Pi tells two stories: a fantastical story, '
            'a story with animals, which is the story with puppets – and a '
            'much more scientific story, which is the brutal realism. Pi asks '
            'us which story we prefer. The meaning of the story is in the '
            'imagination of the puppetry.” Life of Pi is at Wyndham’s theatre, '
            'London, from 15 November',

{'article': 'Sky has said broadcasters need to lead by example on the climate '
            'crisis – despite reports that its chief executive was regularly '
            'commuting by private jet from her home 3,500 miles away in the '
            'US. Sky is one of the main sponsors of the Cop26 climate '
            'conference, and as part of an attempt to nudge the general public '
            'into taking action against global heating, the broadcaster said '
            'television dramas should feature more characters buying electric '
            'cars or ordering vegetarian options in restaurants.\n'
            'However, it has emerged that Sky’s chief executive, Dana Strong, '
            'who was appointed in January, was making long-distance trips '
            'every few weeks on a private jet from her old base in '
            'Philadelphia until she moved to the UK in June, according to the '
            'Telegraph. Strong lived close to the headquarters of Sky’s parent '
            'company, Comcast, which owns a fleet of corporate aircraft. A '
            'spokesperson for Sky defended the private jet commute to the '
            'publication, saying: “Many CEOs leading multinational companies '
            'have schedules that mean it is appropriate to use different modes '
            'of transport.” They added: “It is critical to counterbalance '
            'this, that is why we offset carbon emissions caused by the '
            'business travel of Sky employees.” Sky said the company had '
            'reduced its carbon footprint by 23% since 2018 and Strong’s '
            'travel arrangements were affected by the pandemic as she was '
            'unable to move her family to the UK in her first six months as '
            'CEO. “During this time she balanced visiting her family when her '
            'schedule allowed with running the business,” it said. The chief '
            'executive’s regular use of a private jet is embarrassing for the '
            'company, given that Strong will present guidelines on how the '
            'television industry can help change the public’s behaviour on '
            'green issues at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Sky hired the '
            'behavioural insights team, originally founded as the government’s '
            '“nudge unit”, to develop suggestions on how the television '
            'industry could help change the public’s behaviour using small '
            'encouragements. Their conclusions, shared with the Guardian and '
            'which are due to be unveiled by Strong on Monday, propose a '
            'series of incidental tweaks to television output – whether it is '
            'drama, children’s programming or news bulletins – to change the '
            'public’s actions. Ironically, one of the report’s findings is '
            'that “such activities will be perceived as more legitimate if '
            'broadcasters are seen to lead by example”. The behavioural '
            'insights team concluded that viewers were put off '
            '“fear-mongering, guilt-tripping, blaming or preaching” and often '
            'felt overwhelmed and unable to do anything to help the '
            'environment. As a result they recommend television producers put '
            'successful individual human actions at the centre of programmes, '
            'such as people choosing to take fewer flights. Sky’s guidelines '
            'also propose using trusted news presenters to emphasise the '
            'importance of the climate crisis, having a consistent message '
            'about the need for action on the environment and using the power '
            'of large television audiences to put pressure on politicians to '
            'act. Some climate activists disagree over whether small changes '
            'by large numbers of individuals are enough to halt the onset of '
            'global heating. Many are instead emphasising the role played by a '
            'small number of enormous corporations and governments in '
            'polluting the world. However, the behavioural insights team said '
            'over-emphasising looming devastation without offering hope to the '
            'public risked “alienating the audience” and causing people to '
            'nihilistically double down on existing behaviour. They also warn '
            'that clumsy, forced environmental storylines can turn off '
            'audiences if they make programmes boring, and that the public '
            'will not trust television companies that do not also cut their '
            'own emissions.',

{'article': 'Al Franken on Sunday ruled out mounting a primary challenge to '
            'Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator who four years ago led '
            'calls for his resignation as a senator from Minnesota over '
            'allegations of sexual misconduct.\n'
            'In a statement to Politico, Franken said: “Yes, I miss the Senate '
            'but I’m not going to run against Kirsten Gillibrand.” A writer, '
            'comedian and former Saturday Night Live cast member, Franken was '
            'narrowly elected as a Democrat in Minnesota in 2008 and returned '
            'to Washington much more comfortably six years later. He achieved '
            'national prominence, particularly as an acerbic critic of '
            'Republicans and Donald Trump. His last book before his '
            'resignation was titled Al Franken: Giant of the Senate. He was '
            'forced to quit in December 2017, amid the first stirrings of the '
            '#MeToo movement and over allegations that he touched women '
            'inappropriately or forcibly kissed them. Gillibrand led moves to '
            'push Franken out, writing: “Enough is enough. As elected '
            'officials, we should be held to the highest standards – not the '
            'lowest.” Franken did not face investigation by the Senate ethics '
            'committee. In his resignation speech, he said “all women deserve '
            'to be heard and their experiences taken seriously” but added: '
            '“Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I '
            'remember differently.”\n'
            'He was replaced in the Senate by Tina Smith, a former lieutenant '
            'governor of Minnesota. In 2019, seven serving or retired senators '
            'told the New Yorker they regretted forcing Franken out. Franken '
            'told the magazine he regretted resigning and added: “I’m angry at '
            'my colleagues who did this. I think they were just trying to get '
            'past one bad news cycle.” Writing for the Guardian, the academic '
            'and feminist author Laura Kipnis said: “I myself thought at the '
            'time that if Franken had actually groped women during photo ops, '
            'as was alleged, he was right to resign. “… In late 2017, we were '
            'all pretty on edge, I think, combing our pasts for dormant '
            'memories of assaults and affronts, and there were so many stories '
            '– too many to make sense of. It was an off-with-their-heads '
            'moment, and for a while that felt great. “But there were also '
            'opportunists ‘telling their truths’. There was failed '
            'distinction-making and political expediency, and the '
            'impossibility of sorting motives from facts. That’s what’s '
            'starting to get unraveled now.”\n'
            'After moving to New York City, Franken, now 70, has returned to '
            'national politics as a commentator, with a podcast and a venture '
            'into stand-up comedy, The Only Former US Senator Currently on '
            'Tour Tour. Prior to Sunday, he had done little to scotch rumours '
            'of a political comeback. Politico quoted an anonymous source as '
            'saying Gillibrand, New York’s junior senator since 2009 and a '
            'failed candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in '
            '2020, had been “not exactly cool as a cucumber about” a possible '
            'challenge from Franken. Gillibrand’s chief of staff, Jess '
            'Fassler, told the website: “The only thing she’s worried about '
            'right now is getting family leave into the Build Back Better '
            'package.” In his statement to Politico, Franken only ruled out a '
            'run against Gillibrand.',

{'article': 'The Morrison government has been warned its plan for carbon '
            'neutrality by 2050 will fail if it is solely reliant on investing '
            'in new technology. The Grattan Institute’s Towards Net Zero '
            'report, released on Monday, has suggested the Australian '
            'government would need to pull many other policy levers to reach '
            'net zero, including vehicle emissions standards, energy '
            'efficiency obligations and rules on use of carbon credits. The '
            'report’s lead author, Tony Wood, suggested that the Morrison '
            'government’s net zero plan, announced on Tuesday, failed to show '
            'how emissions reduction would be achieved outside the electricity '
            'sector. Scott Morrison will attend the Cop26 climate talks in '
            'Glasgow from Monday without an increased 2030 emissions reduction '
            'target, despite international pressure from the UK, EU, US and '
            'Pacific island nations to significantly increase ambition.\n'
            'The Pacific Islands Association of Non-governmental Organisations '
            'has urged “rich” nations to “move significantly faster to reduce '
            'global emissions by 2030” in order to limit temperature rises to '
            '1.5 degrees. They have warned that heating beyond that would be '
            '“devastating for our region and some of our countries in the '
            'Pacific would be under the ocean”. It urged that developed '
            'nations phase out fossil fuel production, which Australia has '
            'opposed at the G20, leading into Cop26. The Grattan report noted '
            'that while Australia was on track to beat its 26 to 28% 2030 '
            'emissions reduction target, more must be done today to reach the '
            '2050 goal. It proposed expanding the emissions reduction fund '
            '(ERF) and limits on big emitters in the safeguard mechanism, '
            'investment in the electricity grid, and rules around carbon '
            'credits to help build a market for them. Under the Morrison '
            'government plan, $20bn will be spent over the next decade '
            'investing in technology including an extra $2bn of emissions '
            'reductions bought through the ERF. The energy minister, Angus '
            'Taylor, has suggested similar investments would be needed by '
            'future governments in coming decades but declined to nominate a '
            'total cost.\n'
            'But the Grattan report warned that in the medium to longer term '
            '“such funding from governments will be unsustainable and '
            'regulation should have a limited but valuable role”. “More '
            'ambitious emissions reductions targets are likely to be '
            'required.” Wood told Guardian Australia the Morrison government '
            'plan “doesn’t get you towards net zero by 2050”. “The assumption '
            'in Morrison’s thinking … is that all you have to do is spend '
            'money on the technology then it becomes cheap enough to be '
            'adopted. In some cases it is, but in many cases it’s not.”\n'
            'Wood cited carbon capture and storage and use of green hydrogen '
            'with renewables as processes that “cost more”, a “green premium” '
            'that would have to be paid through a carbon price, whether direct '
            'or indirect, such as Australia’s current subsidies. The Grattan '
            'report noted that over the next decade electricity emissions are '
            'projected to fall substantially, but the next four largest '
            'emissions sources in Australia will either grow or plateau at '
            'best.\n'
            'Wood said with an estimated cost of $20 a tonne to reduce '
            'emissions there was “no way known” the government could expand '
            'subsidies to cut 500m tonnes a year to reach net zero, it is '
            '“beyond comprehension”. “The better way is to have industry do '
            'it, because they’ll find cheaper ways to do it than the '
            'government will … I don’t have problem with the ERF but, like the '
            'technology plan, it’s not enough.” The report argued the first '
            'step should be to stop subsidising developments that will '
            'increase future emissions, citing the Beetaloo Basin and '
            'Carmichael coalmine as two sources that should not be supported '
            'by taxpayer funds. In addition to investing in technology, the '

{'article': 'My husband has left the farm we have worked so hard on since '
            '2007. He says, “I can’t do it any more.” He needs time to rest '
            'and heal. I don’t know what that means for my marriage or if I '
            'can run this farm alone. Will he want to sell the only stable '
            'home I have ever known – my heart’s rest, my lifelong dream and '
            'the oasis I bought as a single 40-year-old? My husband has worked '
            'away most weeks, roaming across New South Wales for our solar '
            'business, so we have been cramming seven days of farm work into '
            'two at the weekends. We are just one of thousands of small-scale '
            'farmers growing beef for the domestic market, artisanal alpaca '
            'yarn for crafters, honey for local shops and small goods made '
            'from our garlic, honey and chillies. Our main farm income is from '
            'the farm stay – reconnecting city folk with country, river, '
            'platypus and free-range happy herds.\n'
            'The drought crept up on us – ground getting harder, air dryer. '
            'Predicted rains in August 2019 never came and by then it was too '
            'late. Cattle lost condition overnight in September despite hand '
            'feeding and then they started falling like flies. There’s a '
            'special kind of stress when a beloved cow goes down and can’t get '
            'up. Propping them up on their knees so they can rest and digest, '
            'carrying feed and water, and hoping for a miracle. The river '
            'stopped flowing. Birds were silent, dust swirled. The water level '
            'in the pools dropped by inches each day as the sun burned bleakly '
            'in an unrelenting blue. My 11-year-old and I spent hours trying '
            'to dig a cow out of a bog and feed her distressed calf. I got '
            'used to turning downer cows by rolling them with sheer force of '
            'will. I washed a million maggots off that bogged cow when we '
            'finally got her free and up. She didn’t make it. So many of my '
            'friends, whom I have raised by hand with love and laughter, lay '
            'down and died. We had to sell what we could rather than watch '
            'them die too. For pennies. The herd we had spent 12 years growing '
            'organically, year on year from our foundation cow, Daisy, was '
            'decimated. Then came the fires, roaring towards us like a freight '
            'train. The air was filled with smoke for months. Some days you '
            'could barely see 50 metres in front of you. We were choking on '
            'our fears, tears, smoke and dust. Our once lush pastures were dry '
            'and bare; all of us haunted, hungry, lean, bewildered. The farm '
            'stay closed for lack of water, smoke and dust. Feed prices '
            'escalated while income dwindled. The sky was orange as if the end '
            'of the world was nigh. And finally our day of reckoning in the '
            'wrath of flame arrived. We were lucky – we had two days to '
            'prepare. Putting sprinklers on every building, water tank, using '
            'precious drops profligately to avert disaster. And then we left, '
            'as friends pitched in to remove our most precious possessions.\n'
            'We returned to find bush and paddocks on fire but infrastructure '
            'safe. Our fear of a crown fire reprieved by a wind change. Then '
            'our lactating, much-beloved bitch went missing when the puppies '
            'were three weeks old. My son’s dog, his all-consuming love. There '
            'was no room in our hearts for that grief. I still don’t think we '
            'have even started to process the loss of Goldie. The air was '
            'thick with the sweet stench of rotting flesh and pregnant with '
            'dust. It was so thick, you could taste it. When it drizzled on '
            'Christmas Day, it was the miracle we all needed. Yes, we had been '
            'beleaguered and embattled but we would soldier on. That’s when '
            'the first news of disquiet trickled out of Wuhan and the long '
            'discussions with my British parents about whether to cancel their '
            'longed-for last ever trip to Australia began (they are in their '
            '80s). Pandemic stress is a different form of helplessness. With '
            'my husband travelling all the time, his fear of bringing home '
            'Covid was palpable. Finances became even leaner as my son and I '
            'locked down. And then came the floods. We’ve lived through major '
            'floods before of course. But no one has ever seen anything like '
            'this. In the final peak, the river rose by 3 metres in 45 minutes '
            '– searing into our memories as we scurried to save what we could. '
            'I scoured the internet for pipes and a 45-tonne excavator to '
            'complement our little 15-tonner. We rebuilt our access bridge '
            'after weeks of wading through creek, belongings held aloft, and '
            'kayaking across raging torrents with diesel and supplies. There’s '
            'a human cost to climate change. It has a worn face – lined from '
            'squinting into sunshine and runnelled with grief from weary eyes. '
            'And not from just the disasters, but also the creeping heat on '
            'the thermometer on the veranda. The wild storms, the tornados, '
            'the dry lightning strikes sparking fire or murdering solar power '
            'systems. Insurance premiums keep rising and damage from one '
            'disaster is still outstanding when the next hits, compounding '
            'grief upon grief, stress upon stress, fear upon fear.\n'
            'You would think that the climate crisis and the world’s call for '

{'article': 'I was recently sitting in a hotel lobby listening to Spotify and '
            'I was surprised to find myself almost in tears. Not because it '
            'was music that got me there: the right song has always been able '
            'to move me. But because of what the music was: erm, the Qantas '
            'soundtrack. It was those two 15-minute orchestrated pieces heard '
            'perhaps millions of times by travellers boarding and disembarking '
            'Australia’s national carrier. It was a surprise. Too little '
            'sleep, I wondered, or the ghost of travel past? For those of us '
            'who relied upon travel for work and to connect with family and '
            'friends, these past two years have been a tough adjustment. I’d '
            'always pigeonholed travel soundtracks as background music, when '
            'really they are often thoughtful sound design – composed or '
            'curated to be functional, whether to calm us, tap emotions, or '
            'connect us to a brand.\n'
            'Stephanie Tully, chief customer officer at Qantas, says the '
            'release of their soundtrack to Spotify and Apple Music is a '
            'response to customers who told the airline they miss flying as '
            'much as getting to the destination. “And this sensory experience '
            'will help fill the temporary void while some of us can’t fly '
            'because of border closures,” Tully says. The music was '
            'commissioned specifically for the airline and was composed by '
            'Haydn Walker from Sydney sound design studio Song Zu. “They '
            'wanted [the soundtrack] to be some sort of journey, to have a '
            'contour to it, an arc,” Walker told Song Zu’s Spotlight podcast. '
            'The track was aimed at relaxing passengers, and Walker says '
            'Qantas wanted it to “feel Australian”, echoing much of the music '
            'the airline had previously played on board. Australian vocalist '
            'and guitarist Dylan Wright helped to create a sense of modern '
            'Australia, Walker says. “Such a beautiful voice – one of my '
            'favourite falsettos but kind of current sounding.” But the music '
            'choices the airline makes are not without controversy. Qantas '
            'decided to remove music programming from their inflight '
            'entertainment portfolio in 2018 due to a lack of usage. In '
            'response, Dean Ormston, the chief executive of Australian music '
            'copyright organisation Apra Amcos, tweeted that a “lack lustre '
            'curation of music focused audio/video could be the cause” of '
            'flyers’ disinterest. He also urged the carrier to take “Aussie '
            'music to the world”.\n'
            'While airlines like Qantas employ the talents of composers like '
            'Walker, there are those who scour the existing canon of modern '
            'music to stitch together soundscapes with, say, hotel design. '
            'Andrew Lewis is a DJ turned music curator who works with hotel '
            'brands like Ovolo and QT. “You have this beautifully designed '
            'hotel so the sense of sight is handled, and then to have the '
            'music be your sense of sound – it’s another touchpoint that you '
            'can really capture people with,” Lewis says. To help his process, '
            'Lewis spends time in the hotels and understands what they are '
            'trying to achieve through design, art curation, furniture and the '
            'space itself. He also considers a hotel’s food and drinks '
            'offering, as in recent years Australian hotels have become a '
            'destination for dining as well as sleeping.\n'
            '“Gold Coast [QT] is different from the music in Sydney and it’s '
            'different from the music in Perth and so on,” says Lewis. “Gold '
            'Coast is kind of beachy and laidback, so there’s big tunes in '
            'there. Sydney is more hustle bustle, so there’s a little bit more '
            'up-tempo music.” Lewis was responsible for the music at Santini '
            'Bar and Grill at QT Perth, working with former executive chef Nic '
            'Wood and New York-based Australian restaurateur Robert Marchetti. '
            '“We went with the Italian crooners and this old school sexy '
            'steakhouse vibe and it works really well,” Lewis says of the bold '
            'dining room. “It could come off really cheesy and weird but the '
            'fact that it’s over styled, the music can kind of be a little '
            'cheesy.”\n'
            'Lewis creates music schedules. Typically breakfast music will '
            'take guests from 6am until noon, then there’s noon until 3pm, and '
            'so on. “I break the music up into tempos,” he says. “I’ll break '
            'it up into 100 beats per minute and under, then keep that from '
            'about 5pm to 6 or 7pm, and then increase the tempo as the night '
            'goes on.” The ultimate in background soundtracks is perhaps '
            'elevator music. And Lewis’s sound design at QT Sydney and '
            'Melbourne extends to these brief interludes between floors, with '
            'sensors in the ceilings changing the music according to the '
            'number of people riding. “With one person we might play All by '
            'Myself, with two it would be something like Just The Two of Us, '
            'and then party tunes after that.”',

{'article': 'When I mentioned to a friend that I was going to be interviewing '
            'Clementine Ford, she said she was curious to read Ford’s new '
            'book, How We Love: “I want to hear about love from someone who '
            'has known so much hate.” I tell Ford this when we connect over '
            'Zoom late one Friday afternoon, Ford sat on her sofa in the '
            'plant-filled Melbourne home she shares with her young son. Her '
            'face lights up with the writer’s appreciation of a neat turn of '
            'phrase and the long-time self-promoter’s awareness of something '
            'she can use. “That’s a great line! I might borrow that. I love '
            'that.” It is no wonder that Ford – writer, podcaster, '
            'self-described “sassy social media bigmouth”, “Hardline Feminist” '
            'per the Daily Mail and “HYSTERICAL FEMALE” per her T-shirt today '
            '– is attuned to ways to describe herself. She has spent nearly a '
            'decade embroiled in highly public controversies, most of them '
            'attempts to silence her no-holds-barred brand of popular feminism '
            '– and some, she allows, of her own making. As the feminist '
            'academic Anita Brady recently wrote: “In Australian media '
            'culture, it is difficult to imagine a figure more visible as a '
            'vector of popular misogyny than Clementine Ford.” Ford seems to '
            'have a particular ability to provoke, flushing out sexism where '
            'it might otherwise go unstated – but also dividing progressives '
            'with her attention-grabbing approach and occasional misfires. '
            'Out-and-proud “anti-feminists”, meanwhile, Ford whips into a '
            'frenzy. In 2017, having cemented her position in the public '
            'sphere with her first book, Fight Like a Girl, Milo Yiannopoulos '
            'performed his disgust of Ford to live audiences throughout '
            'Australia, and millions more online. All of it, praising or '
            'scathing, amounts to make Ford arguably the most famous feminist '
            'in Australia, whose celebrity, Brady argues, “is '
            'indistinguishable from the work of her feminism” – and often in '
            'response to misogynistic attacks.\n'
            'Julia Baird described the bestselling Fight Like A Girl as having '
            '“been shaped in combat”; after spending almost her entire 30s '
            'what might be termed “feministing” in public, the same could be '
            'said of Ford herself. “People always assume that I’m coming from '
            'a place of anger and hate,” says Ford, now 40. How We Love '
            'represents Ford’s attempt to change that narrative – or at least '
            'enlarge it. “As much as I am quite impervious, now, to people’s '
            'opinions of me, I also feel the same human instinct and need to '
            'be understood, which is what so much of the book is about: to be '
            'loved, to be known, to be seen,” she says. “For much of my '
            'career, I have felt very misunderstood – and wilfully, in many '
            'cases.” Now Ford is making a gentle request for understanding: '
            '“I’m not asking you to go easy on me. I’m just asking you not to '
            'reduce me to a stereotype.” The memoir is in the style of the '
            'British writer Dolly Alderton’s hugely successful Everything I '
            'Know About Love, focusing on the most meaningful relationships of '
            'Ford’s life, starting with her family. Born in Queensland, Ford '
            'grew up between Oman, rural England, Brisbane and Adelaide – and '
            '“uncool in each of these places”, she writes. She describes '
            'herself as “a theatre kid at heart”, chronically performative as '
            'only the youngest of three can be. Ford’s father, an Australian, '
            'met her Guyanese mother while she was working in an English pub. '
            'How We Love opens with her mother’s harrowing death from cancer '
            'at age 58, having refused further treatment, and concludes with '
            'Ford becoming a mother herself. Compared with the “manifesto” '
            'Fight Like a Girl (which has been optioned for TV) and the 2018 '
            'follow-up Boys Will Be Boys (a takedown of the patriarchy and '
            'toxic masculinity), How We Love is strikingly devoid of politics '
            'and reveals a surprisingly softer, more self-doubting side to '
            'Ford.\n'
            'That was the point, she says – to ground her activism in “a place '
            'of love for men”, of wanting them and the world to be better. (I '
            'see this in the boundless patience she shows her son in his '
            'frequent interjections through our interview; and in her '
            'respectful exchange with her father when he stood for One Nation '
            'in 2017.) Far from a departure from her political work, Ford sees '
            'How We Love as “a natural companion”. But she had a personal '
            'motivation for writing it, too. After her challenging pregnancy '
            'and childbirth, the furore over the “man-hating” Boys Will Be '
            'Boys, and the breakdown of her relationship with her son’s '
            'father, Ford says she was on track for a mental health crisis if '
            'she continued on her highly public, combative path. “It is quite '
            'bruising, being in a space all the time where you feel like '
            'you’re constantly primed against attack.” Where once Ford spoiled '
            'for the fight (“I really did get off on it a little bit ... that '
            'provocative youthful energy”), motherhood changed her. “It '
            'exposed a soft underbelly that I didn’t necessarily realise was '
            'there … and part of becoming a softer person is being willing to '
            'be more vulnerable in front of people.” Pitching the idea for How '
            'We Love in mid-2019, Ford told her publisher she wanted her next '
            'book to be one requiring no research, that would be “really nice '
            'to write”. It was also somewhat strategic. For some time, Ford '
            'has been conscious of a ceiling to her potential progression as a '
            'mainstream feminist voice – “because I never gave an out to the '
            'men who run the show,” she says. In 2019, Ford quit her '
            'long-running column for the Sydney Morning Herald and the '
            'Melbourne Age, claiming that she had previously been disciplined '
            'for tweeting that prime minister Scott Morrison was a “fucking '
            'disgrace”. Television producers have told her that she has been '
            'knocked back for various projects for being “too aggressive”, she '
            'says.\n'
            'Ford paints a picture of having been backed into an increasingly '
            'tight corner: expected to “always write something angry”, but not '
            'so angry as to actually threaten the status quo. But even people '
            'who agree with Ford’s politics may disagree with her tactics: '
            'always straight-shooting, often oppositional, occasionally '
            'artless – and even arguably counterproductive. In May 2020 Ford '
            'shared vile abuse sent to her by a teenage boy alongside his name '
            'and photo with her tens of thousands of Instagram followers (she '
            'removed the post in response to pleas from the boy’s mother). '
            'That same month, she tweeted that the coronavirus “wasn’t killing '
            'men fast enough”: a misjudged mic-drop concluding comments about '
            'the increased domestic burden on women through the pandemic. '
            'Ironic misandry is par for the course on Twitter – what Ford now '
            'regards as “completely toxic” and “not a healthy place for me to '
            'be” – but predictably inflammatory beyond it. After tweeting on '
            'Saturday afternoon, Ford doubled down on Saturday evening, '
            'apologised Sunday morning, and now rarely tweets.\n'
            'It was “an own goal”, she says. “I’m frustrated for having '
            'written it, in part because now anyone who wants to disagree with '
            'anything just sends that tweet right back to me.” In among the '
            'genuine distress, she says, there were some – notably News Corp '
            'columnists – simply “gleeful” for the chance to lambast her. She '
            'only felt moved to apologise after a Black woman in the US told '
            'her that, there, Black and brown men were overrepresented among '
            'Covid-19 death rate: “I was still operating in a theoretical '
            'space in which men were in a position of power.” It was not the '
            'first time that Ford has been criticised for perpetuating '
            'feminism as a concern of middle-class, cis white women. She '
            'volunteers now that she has historically “perpetuated racist '
            'rhetoric, as a white person who lives with white privilege”. She '
            'likens this to the ways men benefit from structural sexism simply '
            'by being men. “I don’t want them to say ‘Well, I’m not the enemy, '
            'I’m not a misogynist.’ You may not be actively doing these '
            'things, but you benefit from a system that privileges you.” In '
            'recent times Ford has made an obvious effort to share her '
            'platforms with those who are not so readily afforded them. “One '
            'of the problems is we’ve always siloed voices,” she says of '
            'feminism. “Not only has that denied other people the right and '
            'the privilege of being heard, but it also places an enormous '
            'amount of pressure on the one voice who, for whatever reasons, '
            'gets to be chosen.” How We Love, Ford agrees, is at least in part '
            'a strategic attempt to become “more well-rounded” and diversify '
            'her offering. “There must have been a part of me that thought: '
            'for how long can you be the provocative feminist voice? And if '
            'that’s the only thing that you do – at what point does that begin '
            'to actually be the performance that everyone says that it is? “I '
            'never want to be palatable. But professionally and pragmatically, '
            'I’m trying to improve my options.” If Ford had been feeling '
            'unsure about her future direction, the pandemic forced her to '
            'act. She started a podcast called Big Sister Hotline, a weekly '
            '“gas bag” on Instagram Live, and influencing for a sex toy '
            'company (use “CLEMFORD” for 20% off). Ford also receives '
            'donations through her Patreon page, supporting her “feminist '
            'critique, comedy and unassailable truths” – lately, rallying '
            'against anti-vaxxers.\n'
            'The pivot makes explicit the argument of Brady, the academic: '
            'that Ford’s “celebrity is both the product and the site of her '
            'feminist work”, presenting visibility of feminism as an end, not '
            'a means, on platforms that are “safely affirmative”.\n'
            'If she was once considered a radical feminist voice – if only by '
            'virtue of being “foulmouthed” (to quote from her Twitter bio) in '
            'well-mannered spaces – Ford may now more closely resemble a '
            'girlboss: a woman making feminism work for her, through the '
            'neoliberal logic of self-empowerment. It’s a charge Ford engages '
            'with admirably. “Obviously there’s massive problems with the way '
            'that feminism has jumped into bed with capitalism, and I’m '
            'certainly guilty of being part of that,” she says. “I think [that '
            'critique] is important. But once again, it seems to be directed '
            'away from the richest, most privileged people in the world: '
            'largely, white men.” When people fighting for social justice feel '
            'unable to influence those in power, Ford suggests, “it can feel '
            'more effective to throw your tomatoes at the people they’re going '
            'to hit”. Some of those lobbed at her have been “very fairly '
            'thrown, and landed as they should,” she says. But now Ford wants '
            'to get out of the firing line. It is not that she is reinventing '
            'herself, or running away, Ford says. “I just want the '
            'opportunities to tell stories that make people feel things – not '
            'just angry.” • How We Love by Clementine Ford is out 2 November '

{'article': '“Time can bring you down,” Adnan Choopani sings, his words '
            'echoing off the walls of the detention centre compound, “time can '
            'bend your knees”. Time is something Adnan, and his cousin Mehdi, '
            'know only too well. For eight years they have been held by '
            'Australia’s immigration detention regime, offshore and on.\n'
            'They have watched friends burn themselves to death and known the '
            'despair that has led them to attempt suicide themselves. They '
            'have been beaten and abused, jailed without reason. They have '
            'grown from boys into men in that time. Fifteen and 16 when they '
            'arrived in Australia seeking sanctuary, they are now 23. Despite '
            'their claims for protection being formally recognised more than '
            'half a decade ago, they remain in detention. Shunted from '
            'confinement to confinement, often without notice, they have '
            'watched friends being released, to start new lives in Australia '
            'and overseas, but have seen others succumb to medical neglect or '
            'suicide. Self-taught during their long hours of detention, they '
            'play Eric Clapton’s Tears in Heaven, they say, in memory of those '
            'they have lost over their years of incarceration.\n'
            '“Time,” Adnan sings, “can break your heart, have you begging '
            'please.” From detention, Adnan says quietly: “I’ve lost so many '
            'of my friends. “People who never thought they would kill '
            'themselves. I never thought they would kill themselves. But '
            'unfortunately they did. They left us and they are gone.\n'
            '“The closest people to me, they’ve been so close to death, I’ve '
            'been so close to death – it is a miracle I have survived. So '
            'Tears in Heaven is like my situation, of losing people, being '
            'left behind.” Mehdi – he uses only one name - and Adnan were '
            'teenagers when their families urged them to flee Iran, where they '
            'faced systemic oppression as members of the Ahwazi Arab minority. '
            'The cousins, who had known each other in childhood but did not '
            'live near each other, left their country independently, '
            'travelling to Indonesia. By extraordinary coincidence, they found '
            'themselves thrust by people smugglers onto the same overloaded '
            'fishing boat bound for Australia.\n'
            'The pair have barely been apart since. After four days at sea, '
            'their boat was intercepted by the Australian navy and escorted to '
            'Christmas Island, where they disembarked, initially euphoric at '
            'having survived. They were given boat IDs - ANA020 for Mehdi, '
            'ANA023 for Adnan – the dehumanising appellations they would carry '
            'for years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from '
            'Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'Less than an hour after setting foot on Australian soil, they '
            'were told they could not stay. While their vessel was at sea, the '
            'then prime minister Kevin Rudd had announced that all boat-borne '
            'asylum seekers would be sent offshore and would never be allowed '
            'to settle in Australia. The boys spent nine months in Christmas '
            'Island’s detention centre. There, Mehdi was judged to be a child, '
            'but Adnan, a bare handful of months older, was found to be an '
            'adult (the age determination methods used by Australia have since '
            'been discredited). ‘It really took its toll’ In 2014, Mehdi and '
            'Adnan were transferred to Nauru and Adnan was now recognised as a '
            'child. The pair were housed together in the family camp, and '
            'allowed to attend the detention centre school, a modest but vital '
            'enterprise, later shut down by the Australian government. Gabby '
            'Sutherland taught the boys on the island. She found them both '
            'polite and respectful, keen to learn but bewildered by the system '
            'that held them. She connected with them, Mehdi especially, over '
            'art. “He liked intellectual conversations, philosophy, art and '
            'music. Mehdi is a gentle soul, he was quite protective. If '
            'anything ever happened to any of the teachers, or the people that '
            'he cared about, he was always very concerned.” She and Mehdi '
            'still talk about art, and their work – inspired and influenced by '
            'each other – hangs side by side in the Sonder gallery in Cooroy, '
            'Queensland, of which Sutherland is a founding director.\n'
            'On Nauru, Mehdi and Adnan were held in regional processing centre '
            'three (RPC3), a motley collection of tents pitched on gravel and '
            'that grew mouldy in the heat. Late in 2014, their claim for '
            'refugee protection was formally recognised. They had a '
            '“well-founded fear of persecution” in their home country, and '
            'could not legally be returned there. Australia was legally '
            'obliged to protect them. It made no difference to their '
            'situation. The Nauru Files, internal working documents from the '
            'Nauru detention centre published in the Guardian in 2016, '
            'revealed widespread abuse of children in detention. Children were '
            'sexually assaulted, beaten, abused and suffered catastrophic '
            'mental health effects, leading to depression, suicide attempts '
            'and the rarely-seen resignation syndrome. “For the children in '
            'the camp, there was massive deterioration in their mental health '
            'over time,” Sutherland says. “Their happiness, their ability to '
            'function, there was the inevitable vicarious trauma that the '
            'children took on after listening to people screaming all night, '
            'people self-harming, sewing their lips together. It really took '
            'its toll on the kids, it was visible, you could see it, day by '
            'day.” Life outside the wire held little promise of anything '
            'better. A guard paid to protect them threatened Mehdi that if he '
            'was ever released from detention “I will kill you in Nauru”.\n'
            'In October 2014, the 29 unaccompanied minors were released from '
            'detention and placed in accommodation on the island. They were '
            'not safe. The Guardian reported that four boys were beaten and '
            'robbed that month – one left unconscious. “They started '
            'swearing,” one of the children attacked reported, “they said ‘all '
            'mother-fucker refugees, we will kill you, this is our country and '
            'no one can protect you’”. The next month, a threatening letter '
            'was dropped at the houses of all resettled refugees. When Adnan '
            'sewed his lips together in protest at his treatment and sat down '
            'outside the settlement services building on the island, he and '
            'Mehdi – who had sat down to support him – were thrown in jail, '
            'justified by Nauru police as contravening a new law outlawing '
            'protests. Handcuffed and stripped naked, they were thrown into a '
            'prison cell where they were abused, spat on and beaten by another '
            'prisoner. Neither was ever charged. In a separate incident, Adnan '
            'was beaten by a man who mistakenly thought he had been involved '
            'in a road accident. Exposed and uncertain, Mehdi and Adnan '
            'suffered. Their mental health collapsed. ‘Every day we struggle '
            'to survive’ In 2019, they were brought to Australia under the '
            'short-lived medevac laws, which gave doctors, rather than '
            'government officials, the final determination on where a patient '
            'was treated. Dozens of their fellow medevac arrivals are now '
            'living in the Australian community but Mehdi and Adnan have not '
            'been freed, instead shunted between detention centres and guarded '
            'hotel rooms commandeered by the government and designated as '
            '“alternative places of detention”. “It’s been a complete trauma,” '
            'Mehdi says. “We came as children, we were boys, and we never had '
            'a childhood, we were just put in a cage. We did not receive a '
            'proper education, we were never allowed to have fun, we just had '
            'to try to survive in these harsh circumstances. “There’s not many '
            'choices we have had in our life. It’s not like we choose to be '
            'strong – we had to be if we wanted to survive.”\n'
            'Adnan says he despairs at the years he has spent confined. “Every '
            'day is still uncertain, that is the way they punish us. Every day '
            'we struggle to survive. They are going to leave us almost a '
            'decade with no update, no date of release, no charges, no '
            'nothing, it’s completely mental torture.” After initially being '
            'rejected for resettlement in the US during the Trump '
            'administration, Mehdi was this year accepted under the '
            'Australia-US refugee swap deal, but Adnan was not. Mehdi faced '
            'the invidious choice of potentially having to accept his freedom '
            'and leave his cousin behind. Last week, after months of '
            'uncertainty that damaged his mental health and led to another '
            'suicide attempt, Adnan was told he was also eligible to go to the '
            'US. But there is still no date for when it will happen, and no '
            'guarantee it ever will. Detention continues meanwhile, with new '
            'indignities heaped upon them.\n'
            'A month ago, Mehdi and Adnan were forced into handcuffs, marched '
            'onto a government charter flight by Serco guards with other '
            'detainees and flown to Melbourne for medical checks. “There were '
            '30 guards on the flight,” Mehdi said. “They treated us as '
            'criminals, I said ‘shame on you, you are treating me like a '
            'criminal. I have done nothing wrong. I am a refugee, you are '
            'supposed to protect’.” After two weeks in hotel quarantine, they '
            'were given medical checks for potential resettlement in the US. '
            'Since then, they have been held in a Melbourne detention centre, '
            'waiting for news. The department of home affairs declined to '
            'answer specific questions about Mehdi and Adnan’s ongoing '
            'detention. The department said to maintain a “strong border '
            'protection approach”, asylum seekers who arrive by boat would not '
            'be allowed to settle permanently. “Transitory persons brought '
            'temporarily to Australia from a regional processing country '
            'remain subject to current regional processing arrangements... '
            '[and] are expected to return to a regional processing country, '
            'engage in third country migration outcomes or depart for a third '
            'country.” Confined by a detention indefinite and unpredictable, '
            'Mehdi feels his physical health deteriorating. His medication '
            'regimen has been interrupted, and his teeth cause him intense '
            'pain. Daily, he feels his mental health wearing too. He watches '
            'other detainees walk out the gates for lives in Australia, or to '
            'board planes bound for new lives overseas. “I am definitely happy '
            'for them,” he says. “But it is hard to still be here, left '
            'behind. I don’t wish this for my worst enemy. But I wish for '
            'myself freedom. All I can tell you, the last eight years is just '
            'survival, up and down, down and up, trying to survive. “Right '
            'now, I just want to take a walk in the street, I just want a '
            'simple, naive life, but a life that is mine, that is free.” • In '

            'understand and mitigate the threat of ideologically motivated '
            'extremism to Defence and within Defence.” The spokesperson said '
            'the new framework “improves upon existing information exchange '
            'arrangements between Defence and Asio to assess whether someone '
            'is a ‘fit and proper person’ to serve.” They said questions are '
            'asked “to determine whether someone is a ‘fit and proper person’ '
            'to serve, which includes a national criminal check and '
            'psychological screening of all candidates.” “In addition, '
            'candidates are questioned on their understanding of the meaning '
            'and application of Defence values.” Defence would not comment on '
            'the scale of the problem of extremists seeking to join the ADF, '
            'including how many individuals may have already been turned away '
            'as a result of the updated process. Sign up to receive an email '
            'with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            'But Asio disclosed that it had been receiving referrals under a '
            'new framework, which it said was introduced in May this year. '
            '“Some nationalist and racist violent extremists seek to join the '
            'Australian Defence Force to obtain training and capability,” Asio '
            'said in its newly published annual report. “Asio and Defence have '
            'worked closely to ensure Asio security assessment processes can '
            'be applied proactively to these individuals.” The head of Asio, '
            'Mike Burgess, has previously expressed concerns about the issue, '
            'telling 60 Minutes some neo-Nazis were “absolutely” attempting to '
            'join the ADF by concealing their views when recruited.\n'
            '“They can mask that, carry through, get well-trained,” Burgess '
            'told Nine in August. “And when they leave, they’re improved. And '
            'that is a concern if they then use that to train others or go to '
            'acts of violence themselves.” The improved screening measures '
            'stem from government regulations that set out how a person can be '
            'enlisted or appointed in the ADF. Beforehand, the regulations '
            'say, defence is required to consider “whether the person is a fit '
            'and proper person to perform duties as such an officer or '
            'enlisted member”.\n'
            'In addition, all personnel who apply for an Australian government '
            'security clearance face a process that includes an evaluation of '
            'risk factors, including “external loyalties, influences and '
            'associations”. Asio now classifies rightwing extremists, '
            'including white supremacists and neo-Nazis, under the umbrella '
            'category of ideologically motivated violent extremists. The '
            'agency said this category now accounts for about 50% of its '
            'priority onshore counter-terrorism caseload, with the remainder '
            'being religiously motivated violent extremism. Asio has expressed '
            'concerns about the growing number of young men who are being '
            'radicalised by violent ideologies – one of the issues being '
            'investigated by a parliamentary inquiry into extremist movements '
            'in Australia. “There has been considerable and understandable '
            'attention given to nationalist and racist violent extremism,” '
            'Burgess told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday. “But we are '
            'also seeing growth in single-issue motivated groups and '
            'individuals that have the potential to embrace violence. We saw '
            'this, for example, in the recent anti-lockdown protests, where '
            'some adopted violence as a tactic.”',

{'article': 'In the red dust of the Australian desert, more than a hundred '
            'shiny planes are lined up nose to tail, an aviation long-term '
            'parking lot. Hundreds more form geometric patterns in '
            'California’s Mojave Desert, where engineers whack the wheel hubs '
            'of Qantas A380s to scare off rattlesnakes. When Covid forced the '
            'world to stop, planes were herded into enormous storage areas '
            'across the United States, Europe, and just outside of Alice '
            'Springs, Australia. And now it’s time to rip off the plastic, '
            'power up the engines, and prepare for takeoff once more.\n'
            'A week ago Qantas chief Alan Joyce stood in front of a 787 and '
            'talked about the “light at the end of the tunnel” as vaccination '
            'rates rise and borders open. He announced old routes would start '
            'up again, and new routes would join them. The first Qantas A380 '
            'will arrive in Australia on Christmas Day, he said, and a second '
            'will be in place by April. Only three months ago they were '
            'planning to keep them in the desert for longer, he said. “That’s '
            'how fast things are moving and how optimistic we are to meet the '
            'demand, that we’re bringing two of them forward … one of them '
            'before Christmas, one for training and crew.” Many Qantas planes '
            'are in California, while Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage near Alice '
            'Springs is a temporary home for planes owned by Jetstar, Cathay '
            'Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Tigerair and more. Apas had to keep '
            'expanding as the pandemic mothballed more planes, and opened a '
            'second site in Queensland. University of New South Wales '
            'aerospace design senior lecturer Dr Sonya Brown explains that '
            'while the craft are in hibernation, engineers work hard to stop '
            'encroaching wildlife and rust. Ports and openings must be sealed, '
            'and the oil drained and replaced with a preservative oil – a '
            'process called “pickling”. Then there is a raft of procedures to '
            'get them safely airborne again.\n'
            'Earlier this year the European Union Aviation Safety Agency '
            'warned of an “alarming trend in the number of reports of '
            'unreliable speed and altitude indications during the first '
            'flight(s) following the aircraft leaving storage, caused by '
            'contaminated air data systems”. Planes were forced to halt '
            'takeoffs or turn back because of “foreign objects” such as insect '
            'nests in pitot static systems, pressure-sensitive equipment which '
            'provides critical air data information such as airspeed. '
            '“Wildlife intrusion is certainly one of the big things with '
            'storage – insects and bird nests,” Brown says. “There are a lot '
            'of visual checks for animals and the like.\n'
            '“Insects can get into air data lines – they’re a particular '
            'concern because they’re what help the aircraft understand how '
            'high they are, how fast they’re going. You have to flush them '
            'with nitrogen to make sure they’re fully clear. “And there could '
            'be snakes, more likely around the landing gear.” June was '
            'rattlesnake season in the Californian desert and Qantas '
            'engineering manager Tim Heywood says the team came up with a '
            '“wheel whacker” for each aircraft. “The area is well known for '
            'its feisty ‘rattlers’ who love to curl up around the warm rubber '
            'tyres and in the aircraft wheels and brakes,” he says, so '
            'maintenance crew stomp their feet and whack the wheels to scare '
            'them off. (The critical “wheel whacker”, part of the engineering '
            'kit, is a repurposed broom handle.) Brown says planes are stored '
            'in arid areas, away from humidity. Any openings are sealed, parts '
            'get wrapped in plastic, while those insects and birds get turfed. '
            'The engines are powered up regularly, and the wheels are rotated '
            'so they don’t get flat spots. Those that have to be left in '
            'metropolitan airports like Sydney, where many staff are still '
            'based, might have the air conditioner run to clear out the '
            'moisture. Airbus recommends that planes are parked on a flat '
            'surface with the nose pointing into the wind to limit the effect '
            'of wind gusts. In some cases chocks are needed to keep the wheels '
            'in place as there is no hydraulic pressure for the parking '
            'brakes. And it is “strongly advised that operators avoid using '
            'improvised or unapproved items to protect the aircraft and its '
            'components”. And as more routes get opened up, more will be put '
            'through their paces. Each plane has a specific maintenance manual '
            'that details how they are to be taken out of hibernation. All the '
            'protective plugs and covers have to be removed, the tires '
            'pressure-tested. Brown says the software has to be checked and '
            'updated, and all sealed areas will be inspected. Then there are '
            'operational checks on all aircraft systems, from avionics to '
            'flight control systems. “They’ll power them up, preferably to the '
            'highest levels they’d expect to see in takeoff and in flight,” '
            'she says. “It’s very important with long-term storage there are '
            'landing gear checks as well.” To do that, aircraft at Alice '
            'Springs will be flown to Sydney with no passengers and the '
            'landing gear down, so Sydney engineers can do the final checks.\n'
            'The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has put out a series of '
            'high-level checklists for pilots as they return to operations. '
            'They include checking for lockdown fatigue or stress, making sure '
            'skills are up to scratch, and watching out for long grass, and '
            'more birds and animals on runways after periods of inactivity. '
            'The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced the '
            'international travel ban for Australians will lift on 1 November, '
            'and hopes for quarantine-free travel bubbles between Australia '
            'and Singapore, followed by Bangkok, Phuket, Johannesburg and '
            'Fiji. The agreement stands for all states and territories, '
            'although they are in varying stages of openness themselves. '
            'Qantas announced this week that as it resumes international '
            'flights for the first time in 20 months, it will offer more '
            'vegetarian food options, and even a signature cocktail to '
            'celebrate its return. There will also be a digital travel guide '
            'to help passengers navigate the complicated world of vaccine '
            'passports, mask mandates, and other Covid-proofing measures. Most '
            'international airlines will likely only accept vaccinated '
            'passengers, while others will take small numbers of unvaccinated '
            'people who will still face hotel quarantine. Apas managing '
            'director Tom Vincent says his storage site, with those wingtips '
            'gleaming in the desert sun, will still be needed as old planes '
            'are reactivated or retired ones disassembled. “To call us a '
            'boneyard is a blight on what we do,” he says.',

{'article': 'In a busy Melbourne hospital, Paul arrives at work to dozens of '
            'patients in the waiting room. The junior doctor is completing a '
            'rotation in the emergency department and says morale has '
            'plummeted with staffing shortages and huge caseloads. “No one '
            'wants to be at work at all,” he says. Several of his colleagues '
            'have quit, and people are calling in sick for their shifts more '
            'often. Paul is sent up to 10 messages a day about shifts that '
            'need to be filled within the health service, to be paid at '
            '“crisis rates”. “I desperately want to quit. The combination of '
            'last year and this year is just exhausting,” he says. “You’ll '
            'start a night shift and you have nine or 10 hours of wait time '
            'and like 40 people waiting to be seen. It’s like this massive '
            'wall of work that you know you’re not going to get through, even '
            'if everyone works at twice the pace.” Simple comforts that once '
            'eased the stress of chaotic shifts, like sharing a meal with a '
            'colleague, have fallen by the wayside. “You can’t even recognise '
            'your co-workers if you walk past each other in the street, '
            'because [at work] you’ve got an N95 and a face shield,” Paul '
            'says. “You end up just getting really burnt out and really '
            'tired.” An already strained system Prof Samuel Harvey, a '
            'psychiatrist and deputy director of the Black Dog Institute, says '
            'Covid-19 has put additional pressure on a health system that '
            'didn’t have much spare capacity in the first place.\n'
            'Even before the pandemic began, more than half of doctors were '
            'working long hours that put them at risk of clinical fatigue. '
            'Medical professionals have a higher suicide risk than the general '
            'population, and a recent review led by Harvey, published in The '
            'Lancet, found between a quarter and a third of doctors report '
            'significant mental ill-health in their early years of training. '
            '“Many of us have been aware of [mental health issues in doctors] '
            'for a while, but I think Covid-19 has brought it into sharper '
            'focus,” Harvey says. Historically, there is stigma associated '
            'with reporting mental health issues: a BeyondBlue survey of '
            'doctors and medical students previously found that 40% said they '
            'judged peers with a history of mental health disorders as “less '
            'competent”. Junior doctors – those in training for specialist '
            'accreditation, which can take up to a decade – report higher '
            'levels of distress than their senior counterparts, says Katherine '
            'Petrie, also of the Black Dog Institute. A combination of long '
            'working hours, studying for exams on top of full-time work, '
            'taking on extra research projects, and the competitive pressure '
            'of getting accepted on to specialist training programs creates a '
            '“perfect storm” for mental distress, she says. A study '
            'co-authored by Petrie, Harvey and their colleagues prior to the '
            'pandemic found that junior doctors in Australia worked an average '
            'of 50 hours a week. One in four reported working more than 55 '
            'hours in an average week, which was associated with a doubling in '
            'the risk of common mental health problems and suicidal ideation.\n'
            '“There was such stress on the resources and the staffing before '
            'Covid,” Petrie says. AI rostering seeks improvements Reduced '
            'total working hours and better rostering systems have been '
            'floated as options to alleviate these crippling pressures. Prof '
            'Mark Wallace at Monash University says it is unlikely, however, '
            'that hospitals will be open to systems-wide changes while '
            'struggling with Covid. “Just when you need the most optimisation, '
            'the most management of resources, is whenever everything’s under '
            'pressure and nobody’s got any time to think about it,” he says. '
            'Wallace has been involved in developing an AI-powered rostering '
            'system, known as AlertSafe, that takes into account how fatigue '
            'levels increase over time, as well as the effect of circadian '
            'rhythms and working at night. He is in discussions to trial the '
            'system in Victorian hospitals. “The way fatigue builds up over a '
            'long time can depend on shift patterns,” he says, adding that '
            'studies of similar rostering systems overseas have previously '
            'found a 15% drop in medical incidents by minimising staff '
            'fatigue. Despite the evidence, it has been “very difficult” to '
            'implement the rostering system in hospitals, even when there has '
            'been union and senior management support, Wallace says. “It '
            'quickly falls back into how things used to work before.” That '
            'means long hours and overtime work in a system which risks '
            'jeopardising fatigued doctors and their patients.\n'
            'In a 2021 Hospital Health Check report, released by the Victorian '
            'branch of the Australian Medical Association, 47% of training '
            'doctors said they had made a clinical error due to fatigue, while '
            'the same percentage said they were never paid for unrostered '
            'overtime. Bree, a junior doctor currently working in a stroke '
            'unit at a Melbourne hospital, describes it as “a thankless job '
            'with consistent abuse”. Some of the stroke team has been seconded '
            'to Covid wards, causing staffing shortages. “The other weekend '
            'there were two people covering 75 patients,” Bree says.\n'
            'While her officially rostered hours have not been excessive, she '
            'says she has worked “plenty of overtime” updating patients’ '
            'families on their conditions, adding: “They ‘forgot’ to roster '
            'someone on stroke next week and are trying to get us to work '
            '16-hour shifts to cover them.” Bree has tried escalating her '
            'concerns multiple times. “All I got was a 10 minute ‘check-in '
            'chat’ with administration and a request to ‘check-in again’ at '
            'the end of the [three-month] rotation.” Allegations of systemic '
            'underpayment are common: in the past year, five class actions '
            'have been brought by thousands of junior doctors in Victoria. In '
            'New South Wales, a similar class action is under way, with more '
            'than 20,000 training doctors claiming unsafe excessive hours and '
            'underpayment. Hayden Stephens, a lawyer representing the '
            'claimants in both states, says the cases are motivated by a need '
            'to address the dangerous effects of excessive working hours and '
            'clinical fatigue on patient care. “A common theme is not just '
            'their own welfare but the genuine concerns they have in relation '
            'to their patients,” he says. “It’s really out of frustration … '
            'that they’ve had to resort to legal process to embark on cultural '
            'change in their own workplaces.”\n'
            'Stephens is currently investigating similar actions for junior '
            'doctors in the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia, '
            'though no claims have yet been filed. Dr Anthony Llewellyn, who '
            'provides career support to trainee doctors, says bullying of '
            'junior doctors is also rife, calling it “an international problem '
            'in medical culture”. In a 2018 survey he conducted of first- and '
            'second-year doctors in NSW, more than half of respondents '
            'reported being bullied, and one in six said they had experienced '
            'sexual harassment. Of those who had experienced bullying or '
            'harassment, 40% chose not to speak out, says Llewellyn. “When '
            'they did choose to take action, most of them reported that the '
            'action was not positive for them.” None of the doctors who shared '
            'their personal experiences with Guardian Australia were '
            'comfortable being identified by their real names. Majority fear '
            'burnout As states begin to reopen and significant numbers of '
            'Covid patients are admitted to hospital, the strain on an already '
            'fatigued workforce is now becoming clearer. The Royal '
            'Australasian College of Physicians, which represents 28,000 '
            'specialists and trainees in 33 medical specialities, conducted a '
            'survey of its members in September and October.\n'
            'Reported for the first time by Guardian Australia here, the '
            'survey found significant levels of distress among doctors: 87% of '
            'respondents said they were concerned about staff burnout, while '
            '76% were worried about an increase in Covid-19 hospital '
            'admissions. “There have been industrial issues associated with '
            'the demand on medical staff, meaning longer working hours, '
            'out-of-scope activities that medical staff have been asked to '
            'do,” says Prof John Wilson, the president of RACP. “It also means '
            'that leave arrangements have unexpectedly been altered or could '
            'not be taken as promised.” “The current environment is leading '
            'people to look for escape options,” Wilson says. The college '
            'believes that without additional resources, the health system '
            'will not cope with the current level of demand. Wilson is calling '
            'upon the federal government to release modelling to help medical '
            'colleges “plan and also advise on distribution of workforce and '

            'launched last year. “We’ve now moved to a point where almost '
            'everyone is saying: we agree, the current system is not doing '
            'enough to protect the next generation of doctors moving through,” '
            'Harvey says. Llewellyn agrees, saying there is now an '
            'acknowledgement within the medical community that giving junior '
            'doctors “resilience training” to manage workplace stress is not '
            'an adequate solution to the problem. At the end of the day, says '
            'Monash University’s Harvey, “if you’re going to try and find ways '
            'to have junior doctors … work less severe hours, then there’s '
            'going to be a financial implication for us as a society.” “We as '
            'mental health professionals would say that’s the price we have to '
            '[pay], because we can’t keep on operating in a system where so '

{'article': 'Australia will reopen quarantine-free entry to fully vaccinated '
            'Singaporeans from 21 November. The new travel agreement follows a '
            'meeting between Scott Morrison and the prime minister of '
            'Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting '
            'in Rome on Sunday. The two governments have agreed that '
            'Singaporeans departing from Singapore can travel to Australia '
            'without having to quarantine after arrival. There will be no '
            'requirement to have spent 14 days in Singapore prior to '
            'departure. Last week, Singapore announced Australia would be '
            'included in its vaccinated travel lanes arrangements. Fully '
            'vaccinated Australians will be able to enter the country without '
            'quarantining from 8 November. Australia is also keen to welcome '
            'back Singaporean students as universities and other education '
            'institutions reopen their campuses. More than 130,000 '
            'Singaporeans have graduated from Australian universities, and '
            'since 2014, 3,360 Australian students have undertaken study and '
            'internships in Singapore under the New Colombo Plan.\n'
            'Quarantine-free travel from New Zealand to Australia will resume '
            'from Monday, and during a meeting with the Indonesian president, '
            'Joko Widodo, in Rome, Scott Morrison said Australia was also keen '
            'to facilitate travel to Bali as soon as practicable. Morrison '
            'said quarantine-free travel from Singapore was consistent with '
            'the reopening objectives set down in the national plan. According '
            'to the national plan, once vaccination rates reach 80% Australia '
            'will extend travel bubbles for unrestricted travel to countries '
            'including Singapore and Pacific nations.\n'
            '“This means within weeks Australia will be welcoming tourists '
            'from two of our top ten travel destinations,” Morrison said. '
            '“This is the billion-dollar boost that Australia’s tourism '
            'industry has been waiting for.” Earlier in October, Australia '
            'took two steps to restart international travel, with the New '
            'South Wales government announcing vaccinated travellers would be '
            'able to come through Sydney without hotel or home quarantine and '
            'the Morrison government lifting the outbound travel ban from 1 '
            'November. Victoria has also agreed to scrap quarantine for fully '
            'vaccinated international arrivals from Monday.\n'
            'Qantas has confirmed that flights to Singapore will resume on 23 '
            'November, four weeks earlier than scheduled. The airline will '
            'operate flights three days a week, ramping up to daily flights '
            'from 18 December. Jetstar will fly from Melbourne and Darwin to '
            'Singapore from 16 December. Australia’s national carrier says '
            '11,000 Australia-based staff will be back at work in early '
            'December, with a new route to New Delhi, and flights from Sydney '
            'to Bangkok, Phuket, Johannesburg and Fiji resuming ahead of '
            'schedule. Earlier this month, Morrison dampened the NSW premier '
            'Dominic Perrottet’s announcement of quarantine-free travel to '
            'Sydney by warning that Australian citizens, residents and their '
            'families would be prioritised over tourists, students and other '
            'visa holders. On Sunday the tourism minister, Dan Tehan, told '
            'Weekend Sunrise he hoped foreign workers and students could begin '
            'coming to Australia “before Christmas”. Sign up to receive an '
            'email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n'
            '“We want to make sure that with New Zealand and Singapore, we’re '
            'opening up successfully,” he said. “And then we want to bring '
            'that workforce in that we need, those working holiday visa '
            'makers, our agricultural workforce. “And then hopefully before '
            'Christmas, we might even see some international tourists coming, '
            'so exciting times.” “Tourism Australia will look to scale up its '
            'marketing activities in New Zealand, with an immediate focus on '
            'building confidence and broadening knowledge of the depth of '
            'Australia’s tourism offering,” Tehan said in a statement on '
            'Sunday. He said in 2019, New Zealand was the second-largest '
            'source of visitors to Australia at 1.4 million visitors, spending '

{'article': 'There was no rallying cry, no guttural exhortation, no last-ditch '
            'roar of hope. The Carrow Road tannoy informed Norwich’s faithful '
            'that their team would have five added minutes to salvage this '
            'game and possibly to dredge some meaning from this most bleak of '
            'seasons, but the news was met with barely a murmur. This was '
            'apathy rather than open revolt: the atmosphere had been equable '
            'throughout but that had its own implications. There are still 28 '
            'games left but the acceptance phase of grief has reached these '
            'parts with alarming speed and, on this evidence, only a wild '
            'optimist would suggest the Canaries are in for anything beyond a '
            'long and painful winter. In the moments after Anthony Taylor blew '
            'for full time, Tim Krul walked towards the Barclay end and raised '
            'his hands in a mea culpa. It was Krul who let Rodrigo’s '
            'speculative shot slip through him on the hour, puncturing the '
            'swell of something resembling belief that Andrew Omobamidele’s '
            'equaliser had inspired. Norwich never recovered; Leeds were '
            'nothing special here, still well short of recapturing their old '
            'vim, but comfortably saw out a win that should postpone any lurch '
            'into crisis mode for Marcelo Bielsa.\n'
            'It means the question marks over Bielsa’s opposite number, Daniel '
            'Farke, grow bolder. Despite Norwich’s miserable haul of two '
            'points, which extends across 20 top-flight games if their end to '
            'the 2019-20 season is accounted for, that feels slightly harsh. '
            'He is a good man and has done an outstanding job leading Norwich, '
            'directionless when he arrived, to two promotions. But, as the '
            'sporting director, Stuart Webber, reminded everyone on Wednesday, '
            'he has been better equipped this time around: Norwich and their '
            'glut of recruits are yet to make a fist of things and, as a '
            'minimum, that must surely change soon. “We are not playing for '
            'warm words, we are playing for points,” Farke said. “If you don’t '
            'achieve them in games like this, it’s difficult to achieve our '
            'targets and earn the right to stay in the league.” Two seasons '
            'ago Norwich’s quixotic endeavours did indeed earn praise even if '
            'they were ultimately blown away. Now they simply look blunt when '
            'on the front foot and porous in their attempts to tighten up; it '
            'is a mix that will, at this rate, mean their latest yo-yo back to '
            'the Championship is sealed well before May. “What is lacking is '
            'the quality in both boxes,” the head coach admitted. There was no '
            'shortage of effort and Norwich could contend that, in a frayed '
            'first half, they had held the upper hand. A skittish Leeds had '
            'created the only genuine chance, Dan James skipping around Krul '
            'before seeing Grant Hanley stretch to clear off the line, but it '
            'was clear Farke had sent his players out to show some initiative. '
            'Driving runs from Ozan Kabak, Mathias Normann and Kenny McLean '
            'kept interest levels high; Teemu Pukki flashed wide from 18 yards '
            'and Milot Rashica, lively on the left, made Illan Meslier sprawl '
            'to save from distance. It was a sight more palatable than the '
            'surrender at Chelsea. But 11 minutes into the second half Norwich '
            'were punctured when Raphinha, back from injury, received James’ '
            'swept pass and jinked inside from the right. Past Omobamidele, '
            'past Hanley, one step ahead ofKabak’s pained lunge: he drilled '
            'low past Krul for an opener out of keeping with proceedings and '
            'Leeds, hitherto loose, had their breakthrough. They might have '
            'wished the game was still goalless given the apparent change in '
            'momentum when Omobamidele rose to meet a Rashica corner conceded '
            'sloppily by Meslier, and head his first senior goal. Seasons have '
            'turned on less for relegation strugglers but Norwich instantly '
            'threw their reprieve away. First Kabak was robbed by Pascal '
            'Struijk; then the otherwise patchy Kalvin Phillips took the '
            'initiative and found Rodrigo, whose strike from almost 30 yards '
            'perhaps dipped late but should still not have beaten Krul.\n'
            '“The performance was a deserved victory,” said Bielsa. “It wasn’t '
            'an easy game to play for us.” Leeds finally gathered composure '
            'when ahead for the second time and looked likelier to score the '
            'next goal. The margins in the table’s nether reaches were so fine '
            'at the outset, though, that any other outcome would have seen '
            'Bielsa fielding the tough questions. Instead those were reserved '
            'for Farke. “There’s only 20 managers allowed to work on this '
            'level, 20 teams to play in this level, and, if you can’t handle '
            'that pressure, you cannot work here,” he said. Bielsa made a '
            'point of praising Farke’s “spiritual fortitude”; Norwich already '
            'need an act of god, and everyone here knew it.',

{'article': 'An Italian restaurateur known as the “father of tiramisu” has '
            'died aged 93. Ado Campeol died at his home in Treviso, in the '
            'Veneto region, on Saturday. Although the dessert’s origins are '
            'often disputed and the family never asserted copyright over the '
            'recipe, Campeol and his wife, Alba, the owners of the restaurant '
            'Alle Beccherie, are widely considered to be its inventors.\n'
            'According to historians, the dish – featuring egg yolks whipped '
            'with mascarpone cheese, layered over coffee-soaked biscuits and '
            'topped with bitter cocoa powder – was added to their restaurant’s '
            'menu in 1972. The word tiramisù, literally translated as “lift me '
            'up”, comes from the Treviso dialect’s “tireme su”, and the '
            'dessert was claimed to have aphrodisiac effects. Roberto '
            'Linguanotto, a chef who worked at Alle Beccherie and is described '
            'by many as the dessert’s co-inventor, said tiramisu was the '
            'result of an accident. Campeol’s son Carlo, who now runs the '
            'restaurant, said: “When Alba was breastfeeding me a few years '
            'earlier, she had turned to mascarpone mixed with sugar and '
            'biscuits soaked in coffee to keep her energy up, which is '
            'traditional in Treviso. Then, with her chef, she turned those '
            'elements into a pudding.” Campeol had worked since he was a young '
            'boy at Le Beccherie, which his family took over in 1939. “My '
            'father was an extremely correct person, very attached to his '
            'family, a serious professional,” Carlo told the Italian daily '
            'newspaper Corriere della Sera. “He was an inspiration to us all”. '
            'The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, wrote on Twitter: '
            '“The city lost another star in its food and wine history.” In '
            '2013 Zaia pushed to win EU certification for the sweet, which '
            'would set in stone the exact ingredients used the day it was '
            'invented in Campeol’s. Numerous variations of tiramisu exist. '
            'Some chefs use other cakes such as panettone. Although the '
            'original recipe – certified by the Italian Academy of Cuisine in '
            '2010 – was alcohol-free, variants include alcohol such as rum or '
            'marsala. “Every country has their own taste,” Linguanotto once '
            'said. “As long as it lifts you up, it’s fine by me.”',
