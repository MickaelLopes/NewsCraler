{"title": "Enough with the origin stories. Film-making has become too risk-averse | Helen O'Hara", "article": "The trailer for Pixar\u2019s upcoming film Lightyear debuted last week, and met an unexpectedly muted response from film fans. It promises to be a fun, child-friendly animated space adventure with Chris Evans leading the voice cast, which should have delighted the faithful. But it centres on a character called Buzz Lightyear, derived from its Toy Story series, and appears to be yet another case of a film studio giving an unnecessary backstory to a character who arrived onscreen fully formed. For decades, fans and critics complained about Hollywood\u2019s endless sequels, which eventually run out of steam by either ratcheting up the action to ludicrous heights or losing sight of what made their heroes interesting in the first place. Instead, to keep those same franchises alive, studios responded by pivoting to reboots, prequels and origin stories. These initially seemed more fruitful \u2013 a fun flashback origin opens Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with River Phoenix\u2019s young Indy gaining all his character tics in a single eventful afternoon \u2013 but now we have an endless parade of such flashbacks masquerading as standalone films. Han Solo, Cruella de Vil, the wizard of The Wizard Of Oz, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees: they\u2019ve all had unnecessary origin stories. And all of their films share the same basic problem as the sequels: studio executives only seem to feel safe when they\u2019re greenlighting films based on popular existing franchises, and that is self-defeating. The problem is not that Hollywood is out of ideas or original characters; we have a more diverse and daring crop of film-makers than at any time in film history. The issue is timid studios that prefer endless rehashes of the same characters because no one ever got fired for saying yes to a sequel or prequel. If your star gets too established and expensive, make an origin story and replace Johnny Depp with the younger, cheaper Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, such as in the new Wonka film. If there\u2019s a time when you can\u2019t quite decide where to go with your Batman or Spider-Man series, write an origin story for their villains, and spin off Joker and Venom. Those two films also appealed to an older audience than the franchises that birthed them, but origin stories can go the other way too: the forthcoming Minions: The Rise of Gru takes a younger, cutesier approach to the protagonist of Despicable Me, presumably hoping that the latest crop of preschoolers will discover that franchise. And as with Joker and Venom, any notable villain is now fair game for their own origin-story prequel, taking a sympathetic view of their passage to the dark side: consider Maleficent, Cruella or the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy.\nThe origin-story prequel has become a popular \u2013 with studios \u2013 way of reinvigorating dead or aged-out characters over and over. They\u2019re not all bad, but the drama of prequels is inherently limited. We know that the hero of Solo: A Star Wars Story will survive his adventure; we also know he\u2019ll make friends with a Wookiee and get a ship called the Millennium Falcon. But worse than that, none of this backstory adds much to his character. Han Solo arrived onscreen perfectly formed. We didn\u2019t know what the Kessel run was; we just knew that the guy who did it in \u201cless than 12 parsecs\u201d was the coolest man alive. Learning that Darth Vader was once a sad little blond boy, or that Hannibal Lecter was scarred by the second world war only detracted from their effectiveness. It\u2019s a rare prequel that adds useful context to an indelible character without stealing their mystique: The Godfather Part II is, if anything, the exception that proves the rule. The best we can hope for is a prequel with a clever twist: 2009\u2019s Star Trek film created a parallel timeline to the original TV series, allowing it to go off in a new direction without being locked into what had gone before. The Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s overarching narrative has allowed that studio to launch new heroes and reboot elements of its story through time travel or multi-verse stuff without resorting to many outright origin stories or reboots \u2013 so far. At least Lightyear, technically, is not a prequel, even if it has all the hallmarks of one. It\u2019s the story of the fictional character that inspired the Buzz Lightyear toy we know. This is the Toy Story universe\u2019s equivalent of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon, someone Buzz\u2019s owner Andy would have watched on TV. That could offer some laughs and potentially a fun contrast to the studio\u2019s all-conquering toys \u2013 but it\u2019s still just another variation on a character we are familiar with, and catchphrases we\u2019ve heard before. Pixar is far from the worst offender in this respect \u2013 Lightyear will follow recent original stories Luca, Soul and Onward \u2013 but this is essentially a fifth Toy Story feature, not counting short films, from a studio with greater potential for original storytelling than any other on Earth. Where are the great new characters and stories going to come from if we keep dipping into past triumphs for every film with a budget over $5m? If we only recycle the characters we already know we like, pop culture will finally eat itself.

{"title": "\u2018Wondrous and amazing\u2019: female California condors can reproduce without males", "article": "The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America, with a 10ft wingspan that enables it to soar up to 15,000ft \u2013 nearly half the height of a commercial airplane. Now the birds can claim another superlative feat: scientists have discovered that females can reproduce without a male partner, in a rare phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. Oliver Ryder, the director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, has called the recent findings a \u201ceureka moment\u201d. \u201cMany scientists have experiences like this when they see the world in a way they haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d says Ryder, who co-wrote a paper detailing the discovery, released in late October. \u201cI was really pleased to figure out something that was such a conundrum.\u201d Condors have been imperiled for a century. As Europeans settled the west, they often shot, poisoned and captured the condors, collected their eggs, and reduced their food supply of antelope, elk, and other large wild animals. Their population declined steadily until only 22 remained in 1982, but a state-led recovery program has since successfully bred the animals back from the brink.\nThe journey that led to discovering the condor\u2019s asexual reproduction also began in the 1980s, when the San Diego Zoo was tasked with developing a test to determine the sex of the few remaining wild condors, which were eventually all brought into the care of two captive breeding locations. Ryder says the zoo continued to use DNA testing to determine the familial relationships between the condors, to avoid inbreeding closely related individuals. More recently, scientists decided to undertake a complete genetic analysis of the population, which had grown to more than 900 birds. . They used condor samples collected over the course of the program\u2019s 30-plus-year history, including blood, eggshell membrane, tissue from deceased birds, and feathers. When the scientists completed their investigation, there were two glaring cases that indicated something was amiss. Both involved chicks that came from an egg without genetic material from the male who shared the enclosure and was presumed to be the father. The results were confirmed by multiple samples, so scientists were confident it wasn\u2019t a mistake. Ryder remembers the conversation with his colleague about the strange cases. He got goosebumps as he realized that the condors had reproduced through parthenogenesis \u2013 a form of reproduction in which an egg can develop into an embryo without being fertilized by a sperm. Parthenogenesis is derived from the Greek words for \u201cvirgin birth\u201d and several insect species including aphids, bees, and ants are known to reproduce through the process, although the phenomenon is rare in birds.\nRyder says it\u2019s not yet known how unusual this kind of reproduction is in the natural world, because detailed genetic analysis of large populations hasn\u2019t been conducted. \u201cThink about it: the cases where we do know about it, it\u2019s overwhelmingly where animals are managed in a way where females don\u2019t have access to males. It was only because we had these detailed genetic profiles of the condor which were developed in response to the need for managing generic diversity that we discovered this.\u201d The idea that these are \u201cvirgin births\u201d is incorrect, he says: the females who reproduced this way had previously had many chicks through sexual reproduction. And birds don\u2019t give birth; they lay eggs that hatch. Ryder thinks this phenomenon is probably going on in more species than people know. There are reports of snakes in the wild producing offspring through parthenogenesis. He says it\u2019s a \u201crare but possibly impactful part of reproduction\u201d. The condor is still considered a threatened species, and it remains unclear what solo reproduction will mean in terms of helping with conservation efforts. Condors can live into their 50s, but both of the male chicks born of asexual reproduction were relatively small and died before becoming sexually mature, at 1.9 and 7.9 years old.\nRyder hopes to use the same genetic tools to peer into past populations \u2013 California condor specimens from the 1800s and 1900s are commonplace in museums in the state and scientists could use them to assess how common parthenogenesis was in previous generations. He adds that the condor is a remarkable species that has survived from the Pleistocene era. Right now, the condor\u2019s population growth is limited by poisoning from lead bullets, when the scavengers eat animals shot by hunters. \u201cIt\u2019s been critically endangered and there\u2019s a lot of public support for recovery,\u201d Ryder says. Meanwhile, the bird,which has risen like the phoenix from near death, is rewriting scientific understanding. \u201cThis is really wondrous and amazing,\u201d says Ryder: in the midst of an extinction crisis, scientists are still making big discoveries. \u201cThis is an unrecognized part of their natural history.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/california-condor-asexual-reproduction-females-males", "last_update": "2021-11-03T03:27:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "How anti-vaxxers and ivermectin advocates have co-opted US local news", "article": "Last November, the WEAR-TV news station in northern Florida aired a segment on Dr Benjamin Marble, a local doctor who created a free telehealth website offering consultations for Covid-19. Marble, the reporter said, had made it so \u201cpatients don\u2019t have to pay a cent\u201d for coronavirus treatment and believed his site could replace Obamacare. To the average viewer, the segment on the ABC affiliate, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, was a local news report touting a local service. What the report didn\u2019t mention, however, is that Marble is a member of America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a rightwing political group that gained notoriety in summer 2020 after some of its members appeared in a viral video touting unproven Covid-19 treatments as miracle cures.\nAFD\u2019s founder, Dr Simone Gold, has headlined anti-vaccine rallies and is facing charges for storming the Capitol during the 6 January riot. Also visible in a photo included in the clip was Dr Stella Immanuel, an AFD member who has claimed masks don\u2019t help curb the spread of Covid-19 and repeatedly said some real world illnesses were caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. Marble\u2019s telehealth page itself links to anti-vaccine information and websites promoting unproven Covid-19 treatments such as the anti-parasite drug ivermectin. Since the start of the pandemic, local newspapers, broadcast television and radio stations across the United States have been among the most popular sources for information about Covid-19. Many anti-vaccine activists as well as doctors and groups promoting unproven Covid-19 treatments have turned to those same channels to spread their message. Prominent spreaders of medical disinformation, including Dr Joseph Mercola, who misinformation researchers have identified as one of the most prolific online promoters of anti-vaccine falsehoods, and members of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund organization \u2013 anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s group \u2013 have appeared on local radio shows or published editorials in local newspapers promoting conspiracy theories about vaccine safety.\nAlthough local outlets lack the audience size of national broadcasters or newspapers, researchers say they can provide a veneer of legitimacy to fringe groups, amplifying their message. Americans have a greater degree of trust in Covid-19 information from local outlets compared with news media in general, a 2020 Pew Research Study found. And even a brief segment or article on local news can have a second life on social media platforms, where anti-vax groups and advocates of dubious Covid-19 treatments widely push their content. \u201cYou have somebody grab something off an obscure website that looks like a newspaper, post it on Facebook and pretty soon the Facebook algorithm takes over,\u201d said Penny Abernathy, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School and author of several books on the news industry. Anti-vaxxers burrow into local media The US has a varied and vast local news landscape that includes broadcast stations, print and digital newspapers, each with their own vulnerabilities to spreading anti-vaccine narratives. Some local news outlets have spread Covid-19 misinformation out of what appears to be a lack of resources or expertise in covering health and science issues, researchers say. In the last 15 years, over half of the journalists working in local US media lost their jobs and more than one-fourth of American newspapers shut down. During the pandemic alone, more than 90 local newsrooms were forced to close down. That has meant many local outlets are operating with skeleton staff.\nThe loss of newsrooms\u2019 subject matter experts is especially notable in coverage of areas such as health and science, which require a high degree of scientific literacy and specific expertise to accurately explain complicated studies and research. \u201cYou hear stories all the time of major state outlets that once had 400 in a newsroom and now are down to 50,\u201d Abernathy said. \u201cThere used to be three people responsible for covering health and now there\u2019s just one person who\u2019s responsible for covering, if you\u2019re lucky, not only health but a range of other things.\u201d The format of local news, with its staunch adherence to the appearance of neutrality, can also create openings for misinformation. In some instances, anti-vaccine activists have been given equal time as opposing voices during televised coverage of vaccinations \u2013 as was the case in a local NBC News San Diego report last November that gave airtime to an avowed anti-vax organization for a segment on \u201cMixed Reactions About Covid-19 Vaccine.\u201d The result was a false equivalence between the two sides, presenting anti-vaccine activists as a contrarian viewpoint, rather than debunking their medical misinformation. NBC News San Diego did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cIt\u2019s an old tradition in journalism to get both sides of the story and unfortunately that tradition has carried a little too far into the science coverage domain,\u201d said Rick Weiss, the director of SciLine, an organization that connects reporters with scientists and is based out of the non-profit American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cBut when there\u2019s just overwhelming evidence that something is true and other things are not true, that\u2019s not the time to give equal coverage.\u201d Politically motivated media moves in Other local news media have made a concerted effort to promote anti-vaccine narratives or help spread information about unproven treatments.\nConservative radio hosts and rightwing websites targeting local news consumers have repeatedly promoted anti-vaccine views to their audiences. Many of these radio shows air on multiple stations and are available online through platforms such as the iHeartRadio network. Radio host Joshua Lane has hosted fawning interviews with multiple anti-vaccine activists in recent months, including Robert F Kennedy Jr. and other members of his organization. Lane\u2019s show airs on five AM and FM stations across multiple states, including ABC News Radio affiliate station KMET in Los Angeles. Lane has called Kennedy Jr\u2019s anti-vaccine organization an \u201cexcellent organization doing some very good work.\u201d Lane did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Meanwhile, a series of local news sites such as Washington State\u2019s Clark County Today, the Atlanta Business Journal and California\u2019s the Desert Review have all published content either from prominent anti-vaccine groups or advocates for unproven Covid-19 treatments. Although they have innocuous names that mimic traditional local news outlets, their content often promotes anti-vaccine views or furthers Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Researchers have come to call these types of organizations \u201cpink slime\u201d outlets and they have become a growing part of the media landscape in recent years. \u201cThe problem that occurs with this is that they don\u2019t have the same journalistic standards, many of them have a decided political agenda to them,\u201d Abernathy said. In one post from early October, Clark County Today, which was founded by David Madore, a wealthy Republican donor who has bankrolled local candidates in Washington state, republished an article from the anti-vaccine Children\u2019s Health Defense group in full. Another article on the site covers local support for a physician\u2019s assistant whom the state medical commission suspended in October for advocating for ivermectin, but does not mention allegations of him attempting to bully local hospital staff into prescribing the drug and spreading medical misinformation that resulted in the suspension.\nIn a lengthy response, Clark County Today\u2019s editor, Ken Vance, told the Guardian that the site\u2019s coverage of the pandemic was informed by the \u201cone-sided\u201d approach from \u201cmainstream news media, social media and even Big Tech\u201d. He added the site does not try to shape readers\u2019 personal decisions around vaccinations, and has published \u201cendless information about vaccinations, treatment and other Covid-related issues, allowing elected officials, government leaders and medical health providers to inform the community\u201d. But, he added, \u201cthose sources continually refuse to even address issues such as adverse effects to vaccinations, alternative treatments for Covid and even preventative measures that can be taken to boost one\u2019s immune system.\u201d But health experts argue that promoting unproven treatments or framing the efficacy of vaccination as a debate is a way for anti-vaccine advocates to further their cause. Anti-vaxxers also rely on out of context anecdotes and demonstrably false arguments, one doctor told the Guardian, in their attempts to contest well-documented research and medical science. The Desert Review, whose publisher has shared pro-Trump conspiracy theories on Facebook, has published a series of pro-ivermectin articles from an author who writes under a pseudonym and makes allegations of a pharmaceutical conspiracy against the drug. They are frequently shared in social media groups promoting the drug, and listed as the most popular articles on the site. In October, the site posted a celebratory message on Facebook touting that one of its ivermectin articles had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The Desert Review and WEAR TV news did not respond to requests for comment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/03/how-anti-vaxxers-and-ivermectin-advocates-have-co-opted-local-news", "last_update": "2021-11-03T01:07:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Card Counter review \u2013 Oscar Isaac deals a high-stakes hypnotic nightmare", "article": "Here is a film about gambling from writer-director Paul Schrader and producer Martin Scorsese that begins with a closeup of the queen of spades \u2013 I\u2019m betting it\u2019s a sly reference to the Thorold Dickinson classic of the same title, about the game Faro, in which that card is such a terrible omen of ill fortune. Schrader has created another drama about obsessive masculinity, fragile hope and potent despair competing for dominance in the heart of a man roaming a nocturnal world of sin \u2013 naturally it\u2019s impossible not to see the echo of Schrader\u2019s screenplay for the 1976 classic Taxi Driver. What did Travis Bickle actually do in Vietnam? (Or is the whole point that we don\u2019t know?) And what if instead of a young girl Travis was trying to redeem it was a young man, a younger version of himself? In various small-scale casinos across the US \u2013 not in the Vegas league \u2013 a professional gambler discreetly plies his trade: this is William \u201cTell\u201d Tillich, played by Oscar Isaac, his seductive sleepy-eyed address to the camera making him look tired, gaunt and even lizardly. William counts cards at blackjack: that is, by memorising every card played, he can calculate the moment at which to bet big, but knows enough to keep his winnings modest to avoid getting barred. In any case he is more interested in poker. William has learned fierce personal discipline, card skills and toxic self-hate in military prison. In every budget motel he stays, William takes all the pictures down and wraps the furnishings in sackcloth to make his room like a cell, or something worse than that.\nDuring a hotel poker tournament, William wanders into a commercial convention on ex-military security techniques and comes across a certain young man: Cirk (Tye Sheridan). Cirk makes William an offer: to help him kill someone of their mutual acquaintance. William counter-offers: Cirk can come on the road with him and learn the world of gambling. Does William want to mentor Cirk \u2013 teach him to channel this rage and hurt into the casinos\u2019 soulless but harmless world the way he has done? But William doesn\u2019t seem to be teaching Cirk anything concrete about card games: is this just a cover so he can co-opt Cirk\u2019s murderous plan? Schrader\u2019s movie is great at showing the airless, affectless world of the casino itself, as well as the grim setup of the poker tournaments in the opening rounds, with contestants squashed together in something as unglamorous as a bingo hall. Robert Altman\u2019s gambling movie California Split from 1974 showed something similar, and William and Cirk are a bit like a less intimate version of the tragicomic buddy pairing of George Segal and Elliott Gould in that film, or perhaps more like Philip Baker Hall and John C Reilly\u2019s master-pupil gambling relationship in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Hard Eight in 1996.\nCirk has come into William\u2019s life at the exact moment that something good is happening to him, if only he could see it. Gambler turned talent spotter La Linda, played by Tiffany Haddish, asks William if he would be interested in turning pro for various high-roller backers of her acquaintance: but actually she has feelings for this coolly reserved tough guy, and the always-likable Haddish nicely conveys her hurt feelings when William maladroitly tells her how much their \u201cfriendship\u201d means to him. Schrader has carpentered a strong and vehement film, hypnotically watchable and squalid with nightmarish flashbacks and a typically apocalyptic ending that grows plausibly enough out of what has gone before. There\u2019s a horrible, queasy urgency to this high-stakes game. \u2022 The Card Counter is released on 5 November in cinemas.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/03/the-card-counter-review-paul-schrader-oscar-isaac", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:00:27Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "First Thing: Republicans win Virginia governor\u2019s race in blow to Biden", "article": "Good morning. Joe Biden suffered a bitter political blow early on Wednesday as the Democrats suffered a shock defeat in the election for governor of Virginia. The Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, had campaigned with Biden and Barack Obama but it was not enough to prevent the Republican Glenn Youngkin pulling off an upset. The Associated Press called the race for Youngkin in the early hours of Wednesday. The Republican took an early lead after polls closed that he maintained throughout the evening, while McAuliffe lagged in key counties that Biden swept in 2020. Clenching his fists then clapping his hands, Youngkin addressed jubilant supporters in Chantilly just after 1am. \u201cAll righty, Virginia, we won this thing!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow much fun!\u201d The battle in Virginia has been seen as a litmus test of Biden\u2019s presidency. It coincided with his agenda stalling in Congress and his approval rating sinking to 42%. Youngkin did not utter the name \u201cTrump\u201d in his acceptance speech. He also did not mention the former president by name in any speeches on the campaign trail although he did accept Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Education was one of the key campaign issues with Youngkin accused of stoking culture wars. Eric Adams wins New York mayor\u2019s race\nThe former police officer Eric Adams will be the next mayor of New York City, after the Democrat defeated Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday\u2019s election. Adams was on course to easily beat Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, with a lead of 66% to 29% after more than half of projected votes were counted. Adams will take charge of the largest city in the US in January, when he will be faced with overseeing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 34,500 New Yorkers. Adams, 61, becomes only the second Black person to be elected New York mayor, after David Dinkins, who led the city from 1990 to 1993. Adams, who defeated several progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, has pledged to cut government inefficiency and made public safety a central part of his campaign. After winning a contentious primary, Adams was always favorite to defeat Sliwa, a Republican, in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans seven to one. The centrist politician has been a disappointing choice for many progressives who hoped to see radical reforms in the criminal justice system. Ahmaud Arbery: trial of accused murderers is test for racial justice \u2018in the heart of white supremacy\u2019 On Tuesday, after 11 days of jury selection, a panel of 65 jurors was chosen from a pool of hundreds in the murder trial of three white men accused in the killing Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old Black man shot dead last year while out for a jog. Barring any unforeseen delays, including last-minute motions defense attorneys have suggested they will file, a final jury of 12 and four alternates will be seated this week, with opening arguments to follow, probably on Thursday. The trial of the three men, who have pleaded not guilty, occurs six months after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis after pinning his neck to the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. That trial was undoubtedly a landmark moment for police reform advocates around the country, but, say many observers, the case of Ahmaud Arbery is a sterner test for the state of racial justice in the US. Who is standing trial for Arbery\u2019s murder? Gregory McMichael, 67, his 35-year-old son, Travis McMichael, and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52 are accused of his murder. What happened? A scuffle occurred as the McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery, who was unarmed. Travis McMichael then opened fire three times. They said they suspected Arbery of involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood.

Voters in Minneapolis have rejected the idea of replacing their police department with a new department of public safety, more than a year after the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer launched a national movement to defund or abolish police.

Don\u2019t miss this: Salma Hayek on being bullied by Harvey Weinstein and and becoming a superhero at 55\nHayek could have easily opted for the cosy, cosseted life of a mega-rich housewife after marrying a multimillionaire. Yet, despite possessing a walk-in closet presumably as big as an average house, Hayek is not your average gazillionaire\u2019s wife. By the time she met Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, she was 39 and a famous actor with an Oscar nomination, for 2002\u2019s Frida.

Between January and August of this year, at least 30 million Americans quit their jobs. Whether you call it the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d or a \u201cnationwide reassessment of work\u201d, the labor market shake-up of the pandemic could have unexpected aftershocks for years to come. Climate check: Radioactive material and pesticides among new contaminants found in US tap water\nWater utilities and regulators in the US have identified 56 new contaminants in drinking water over the past two years, a list that includes dangerous substances linked to a range of health problems such as cancer, reproductive disruption, liver disease and much more. The revelation is part of an analysis of the nation\u2019s water utilities\u2019 contamination records by the Environmental Working Group, a clean water advocate that has now updated its database for the first time since 2019.

{"title": "Three-quarters of Australia\u2019s \u2018significant\u2019 climate aid projects in Pacific don\u2019t mention climate change, Greenpeace says", "article": "Australia has been accused of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d its aid to the Pacific, with the government claiming that major projects are significantly focused on climate adaptation when they have little or no link to climate change or the environment. The accusations, in a new report by Greenpeace Australia Pacific, come after Scott Morrison announced an additional $500m for international climate finance for projects in the Indo-Pacific on the first day of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. But analysis by Greenpeace found that fewer than one-quarter of all aid projects in 2018 and 2019 that the Australian government labelled \u201csignificantly focused\u201d on climate adaptation made any mention of climate change or environmental concerns.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Morrison government over the last few years be really loud and proud about its climate aid to the Pacific,\u201d said Alex Edney-Browne, the investigations officer at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, and report author. \u201cBut climate aid in the Pacific has been greenwashed. The Australian government really needs to drastically improve the transparency and the accuracy of its reporting, otherwise there\u2019s no guarantee that this aid is actually going to improve the climate resiliency in the Pacific.\u201d In 2018, Australia spent US$255.07m on aid that was \u201csignificantly focused\u201d on climate adaptation, compared to US$26.94m on projects that were \u201cprincipally focused\u201d on it, such as sea walls, cyclone-proofed infrastructure and mangrove planting initiatives. However, the Greenpeace report found that in 2018 only 23% of the \u201csignificantly focused\u201d projects mentioned anything to do with climate change in reports on the projects.\nOne of the most striking examples found by Edney-Browne was a governance facility in Papua New Guinea, which over 2018 and 2019 received more than US$80m in Australian aid. \u201cThis was about political administration, improving political participation, decreasing corruption in Papua New Guinea, so no obvious link there to climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cI even read a 113-page evaluation of the project that Dfat [the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] commissioned and not a single mention of climate adaptation in that whole report.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe findings tally with those contained in a report from Terence Wood, a research fellow at the Development Policy Centre at the Crawford School of Public Policy, published earlier this year. \u201cIf you\u2019re a donor such as Australia, with your aid budget not going up but at the same time all these announcements about increased climate finance are being made \u2026 your easiest way out of a difficult bind might be to be \u2026 lenient in how you classify some of your projects,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf you\u2019re suitably creative as a donor, you can convince yourself at least that almost anything is associated with climate change adaptation or mitigation. You build a school and you build it a couple of hundred metres inland, and you might tell yourself, the fact we built this school inland means we\u2019re helping this country adapt to climate change.\u201d\nBut the tendency to do this was concerning and could get in the way of meaningful action on climate projects, he said, and undermined Australia\u2019s reputation in the region. \u201cAustralia really could be earning a reputation for itself in the Pacific as a decent friend for the region, who gave its aid with the needs of the region in mind, and when it starts doing dubious things with its climate finance or making promises that look like they\u2019re larger than they are, that\u2019s probably going to undermine Australia\u2019s reputation and its ability to come across as a good friend in the Pacific \u2026 That on top of the fact that Australia isn\u2019t cutting its emissions in a meaningful way nearly as rapidly as it needs to be.\u201d Edney-Browne agreed, saying it left Pacific countries in a bind. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember Pacific countries are absolute climate champions and sovereign countries, and really great leaders in the climate movement, but they\u2019re still developing countries that are still very vulnerable to climate change, they\u2019ve really suffered the effects of Covid-19, so that power that Australia wields over them through aid and aid dependency is significant.\u201d Dfat was contacted for comment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/three-quarters-of-australias-climate-aid-projects-in-pacific-dont-mention-climate-change-greenpeace-report-finds", "last_update": "2021-11-03T08:26:30Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Victorian Labor MP gave staffer more than $33,000 to pay for party memberships, Ibac hears", "article": "A Labor MP gave a staffer more than $33,000 to pay the party memberships of people within her faction, according to evidence provided to the Victorian anti-corruption commission. But the MP, Marlene Kairouz, whose evidence is considered critical to the investigation into the alleged misuse of public funds by paying staff to do factional activity \u2013 including branch stacking \u2013 will not be subject to a public examination by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac). Branch stacking is not illegal but it is a breach of party rules, as is the payment of other people\u2019s party memberships. Chris Carr SC, counsel assisting the commission, told the hearing on Wednesday that Ibac investigators had obtained bank records showing transfers between Kairouz and Kirsten Psaila, her electorate office manager.\nPsaila worked for Kairouz from 2008 when she was elected. In 2015, Kairouz transferred Psaila $14,700, Carr said, followed by $18,300 the next year. Both transfers were made during \u201crenewal season\u201d, Carr said, around the time membership fees were due. Psaila agreed during her evidence on Wednesday that following both transfers she withdrew the cash to pay for memberships. She said that Kairouz also paid for memberships in 2017, but that she had provided her cash, rather than a bank transfer, that year. Carr told the commission that Kairouz would be the next witness, but that because Ibac had received \u201ccredible\u201d information a public examination could unreasonably damage her reputation, safety or wellbeing she would be examined in private. There were four \u201cstringent\u201d criteria within the Ibac Act that must be satisfied to allow public hearings, Carr said, and the emergence of evidence that suggested Kairouz would be unreasonably damaged meant that her \u201ccritical\u201d answers to matters of \u201csignificant public interest\u201d had to be given in private. Kairouz stood down as a minister after an Age-60 minutes investigation last year aired allegations of her involvement in branch stacking. She has denied all wrongdoing. She took leave from parliament in September following the sudden death of her sister. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nCarr asked Psaila about the details of the work she did on behalf of Kairouz and the moderate faction, including the bulk collection and filling out of ballot papers on behalf of members so as to control their votes in party elections. She gave evidence of \u201ccaptains\u201d within the faction, who were responsible for doing this on behalf of dozens of members, and also took responsibility for renewing their memberships every year. Carr said Ibac had uncovered evidence of systemic forgeries of party member signatures occurring across the electorate offices of two MPs, including the office of Kairouz, but Psaila said she did not know who was responsible for this. After extensive questioning from Carr and the commissioner, Robert Redlich QC, Psaila \u2013 who herself had been accused but denied forging a document on behalf of a member in the mid-2000s \u2013 conceded that it had crossed her mind such forgeries could be occurring. The reason for forging signatures, Carr said, was that it would dramatically speed up the laborious process of obtaining ballot papers on behalf of members, taking it to them to sign, before numbering each ballot (from one to about 120 in some instances) and sending it back to ALP head office. Psaila said she was idealistic as a Labor staffer, had ambitions to become an MP herself, and had been brought up in a Labor family. She said she was introduced to factional politics by George Seitz, who she agreed was a \u201cnotorious branch stacker\u201d.\nSeitz organised the preselection of Kairouz, and she also became responsible for some of his members after he retired, Psaila said. Carr described Psaila as a small cog in a much larger machine, and suggested to her that those who used this machine to become MPs would not have a strong moral compass. \u201cI can only comment for Marlene,\u201d Psaila said. \u201cShe\u2019s a stand-up MP in the local community and she does what she can for the area.\u201d Carr responded: \u201cThat may be so, but she\u2019s administered a part of this corrosive and corruption factional machinery, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cThey all have,\u201d Psaila replied. Earlier in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Redlich raised concerns he had about evidence provided on Monday by Christine Kelly, an electorate officer for Kairouz. Kelly had claimed she had no knowledge of or interest in the 2018 ALP national conference election, despite Ibac hearing evidence on Wednesday that Kelly was standing as a delegate during that election. At one stage in Psaila\u2019s evidence, Redlich also warned her not to fall into the same \u201ctrap\u201d as Kelly, of moving from a position of knowing nothing at all about anybody doing any factional work in the office, to admitting significantly more knowledge after several hours of questioning. Public hearings are scheduled to resume on Monday.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/victorian-labor-mp-gave-staffer-more-than-33000-to-pay-for-party-memberships-ibac-hears", "last_update": "2021-11-03T09:00:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Chancellor by Kati Marton review \u2013 in search of Angela Merkel", "article": "Angela Merkel\u2019s marathon tenure as Germany\u2019s leader may have officially crossed the finishing line with September\u2019s federal elections, but her final lap of honour could take some time. Depending on the pace of coalition talks between the politicians hoping to fill her shoes, she may yet give one more of her annual TV addresses in a caretaker capacity this Christmas. Still, as a new generation of German leaders rises to the fore and Merkel recedes into the background, the contours of her legacy are becoming easier to distinguish. There are quantifiable historic firsts: 16 years in office make her the joint longest-serving chancellor of the postwar era, equalling the record of her former mentor Helmut Kohl. She\u2019s the first German chancellor to have the wisdom to step down of her own will, at the end of a full term. She\u2019s the first female German head of government, the first with a scientist\u2019s training, and the first to have grown up in a socialist command economy. She may go down in history as a once-in-a-century political adaptor, connecting two differently hardwired systems kept apart by the Berlin Wall.\nYet it\u2019s also possible that Merkel may not be remembered as a pioneer, but as the last example of an idea that feels increasingly old-fashioned in an age where more and more political tribes are built around personal identity: leadership as an exercise in ego suppression, holding high office as tantamount to covering the very traits that make you unique. Hungarian-American author Kati Marton is especially fascinated by this aspect of Merkel\u2019s tenure: the intense privacy of a woman who rose to power in an era of oversharing. \u201cAfter several decades, Germans are not tired of her image, her voice, her looming persona \u2013 because Merkel does not loom,\u201d Marton writes in her biography, in response to the German leader\u2019s enduringly high popularity ratings. \u201cDespite knowing little about their chancellor\u2019s private life, other than that she comes across as leading a life not so different from their own, Germans thrice reelected her, each time by a comfortable margin.\u201d From Marton\u2019s US perspective, the contrast is especially glaring: while Donald Trump\u2019s stint in the White House became a reality TV show, broadcast in real time through tweets and continual leaks, Merkel\u2019s chancellory is famously gossip proof. Marton writes that her obsession with privacy \u201cverges on paranoia\u201d. The world was privy to Trump\u2019s every idle thought via Twitter; Merkel, however, keeps no journal, does not use email, and \u201ctexts only briefly and when necessary\u201d. Her long-standing, mostly female set of advisers is not only intensely loyal but almost invisible to the media\u2019s eye. Those who have been unwise enough to blab found themselves banished from her inner circle: one political ally, Marton writes, was never allowed back into Merkel\u2019s confidence after releasing a four-word email with the following explosive content: \u201cThanks for the suggestion, AM.\u201d Few Germans are even aware that their chancellor has a sister and a brother, because they lead ordinary lives doing ordinary jobs and never speak to the press. Her first husband, Ulrich Merkel, whose surname she kept after their divorce in 1982, once gave a reluctant on-the-spot interview in which he praised his ex for her stance during the refugee crisis of 2015. Perhaps after Merkel has left office proper there will be a biography that will lift the veil on her private motivations; Marton\u2019s diligently compiled but often overtly reverential chronological overview is not it. In spite of numerous interviews with close advisers, touted as \u201ccircumventing the chancellor\u2019s extraordinary need for control\u201d, there are few revelations here that cast a new light on her leadership. Marton notes how Merkel was the daughter of a Protestant pastor and the former head of a party with the word \u201cChristian\u201d in its name. She believes her \u201cprivate faith, and the Bible, would steady her sometimes rocky path\u201d, as well as provide a connection with the first US president she met in office, George W Bush. She may well be right, but this book doesn\u2019t present any evidence to back up that claim, nor does it explore how Merkel\u2019s specifically East German Lutheran brand of Christianity may have influenced her. Marton believes Merkel to be a feminist, even if the chancellor herself only used the term to describe herself for the first time last month (in a panel discussion with the the novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). But as with her East German background, the chancellor\u2019s sex was never converted into a policy priority. In fact, little of Germany\u2019s progress on gender equality over the last 16 years can be directly put down to Merkel\u2019s leadership: she initially opposed her labour minister Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s proposal for legally mandated gender quotas for senior management positions. At times, there is a slightly comical sense that the qualities Merkel\u2019s biographer finds most intriguing are also those that most elude her: Marton, who also grew up east of the Iron Curtain and went on to become an ABC News foreign correspondent and marry the influential late US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, cannot help but slide her own story into the footnotes. Not quite the lesson one would have expected a writer to draw from studying a politician who managed to command authority by leaning out rather than in. In one aside, Marton mentions that she once met Merkel at a lunch party hosted by the film director Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff in September 2001, long before she started her biography. The writer Susan Sontag was also in attendance, she reveals, though sadly her memory of what words passed between the two women is sketchy. The pair were \u201ca study in contrasts\u201d, apparently: \u201cSontag, expansive; Merkel, the active listener.\u201d Perhaps while we wait for Merkel\u2019s inner circle to go public and help produce the first truly illuminating biography of her tenure, we need storytellers to fill in the gaps. A chamber play on love, life and the way we live now featuring Merkel and Sontag: now that would be revelatory. \u2022 The Chancellor: The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel is published by HarperCollins (\u00a325).

{"title": "Deathloop: how Arkane used Frank Lloyd Wright, Tarantino and Twiggy to build a world", "article": "This year, there is one game world I have enjoyed exploring more than any other. We\u2019re so spoiled for visually rich open environments these days, it takes something special to keep players immersed, to keep them wandering about looking at stuff, just for the sake of it. Deathloop is a shining example. Developer Arkane is known for its highly refined and individual approach to game art, thanks to the astonishing Dishonored titles, set in a steam-punk dystopia of rats, robotic guards and ornate classical architecture. This time around, the team created a strange Groundhog Day-like adventure set on an island populated by mad scientists and spoiled billionaires, all looking to gain immortality by living the same day over and over again, thanks to a localised space-time phenomenon. The island of Blackreef, where the whole game takes place, provides a fascinating example of how Arkane works. At first, the team built a timeline to explain the variety of natural and human-made features in each region. The location itself is a remote, wintery outpost, heavily inspired by the Faroe Islands, with craggy cliffs and windswept grasslands. On top of this are the monolithic concrete buildings constructed by a group of military researchers who arrived in the 1930s to investigate the island\u2019s weird phenomena. And then, decades later came Aeon, a cabal of rich tech bros, looking for a new playground. \u201cIt was kind of like if Elon Musk had said, \u2018let\u2019s go to the Bermuda Triangle and study it\u2019!\u201d explains art director Seb Mitton. \u201cThey came with all this money and realised they could create these strange events. They said \u2018we\u2019re going to start this loop and we\u2019re going to live forever.\u2019\u201d\nSo in the island\u2019s architecture, you see different layers co-existing: the island\u2019s flora, the military buildings, with bunkers and towering antenna (inspired by abandoned sites in northern Europe, Japan and Russia, such as Chenobyl), and in addition, a hedonistic society, re-purposing and re-decorating everything they see. For this element, Mitton and his team were heavily inspired by the end of the 1960s. \u201cIt was all about freedom of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about hippies, people really wanted change at that time, people wanted to live differently, but you had the cold war as well; there was a lot of violence. We found inspiration in the era of the Vietnam war \u2013 that helped us build the Aeon programme: the visionaries and their guests \u2013 what are their goals in life? For some it\u2019s drinking all day, it\u2019s partying, for others it\u2019s about killing people. But there are no consequences because there is no tomorrow, so, even though there\u2019s a lot of violence, it\u2019s very lighthearted.\u201d The 60s influence is clear in the game\u2019s interiors \u2013 the buildings throughout are filled with brash, multicoloured furnishings, weird art and gigantic Saul Bass-style posters. However, Mitton\u2019s team worked hard to avoid kitsch excesses \u2013 they didn\u2019t want it to become Austin Powers: the game. \u201cAt the same time, we looked at contemporary materials and there were a lot of rugs, a lot of rounded plastics \u2013 it was very different to what we did in the Dishonored games, where it was a lot of straight lines. There\u2019s a big contrast between the outside where everything is cold and hard, and the interiors, where everything is colourful. At Arkane, we love creating contrast because it plays with the player\u2019s emotions. We also developed different layers depending on each of the visionaries\u2019 background: some build laboratories, but Frank has a casino \u2013 for him it\u2019s a party. So we took these different themes inspired by the 60s and we developed them differently to reflect the characters.\u201d\nAnother big influence on the interior architecture was Frank Lloyd Wright, whose approach suited the experience Arkane wanted to provide. As he explains, \u201cHe made these huge offices and in our game that\u2019s very useful \u2013 we couldn\u2019t make very small interiors because we want a lot of mobility. Also, he was one of the first architects to work with diffused light \u2013 so you\u2019d look up and think you were seeing the ceiling but actually it was the light behind it. It was such a different approach to office design. For the parties, we looked at how he lit interiors to make inside light look like outside light, we looked at all his work with lines and wooden curves. As soon as you go in Joanna\u2019s house at the very beginning of the game, you see the 1960s has taken hold: these big rooms, huge lamps, feature fireplaces \u2013 that\u2019s 60s interior design.\u201d Mitton reels off the cinematic influences on the look of the game. It feels like Kubrick is in there, as well as Roger Vadim, but he also cites Jacques Tati\u2019s futuristic classic Playtime, and Tarantino\u2019s Jackie Brown. Importantly though, the townscapes in Deathloop are designed to be play spaces, to encourage joyful exploration. Here, the team was inspired by Italian towns such as Positano, which tumble down steep cliffs towards the sea and look climbable. \u201cYou see it on Google Earth or Street View \u2013 and you think \u2018I could jump from this roof to that one, that would be great\u2019. We call our districts mini open worlds because they\u2019re not linear, you can go everywhere, there are very few buildings closed off \u2013 some that are closed during the day might be open in the evening. We play a lot with physics and water levels, so some places unlock when tides go out. It\u2019s really important to make sure players don\u2019t get burned out. When people play Dishonored, even today they\u2019ll still find different passageways.\u201d For the strange costumes worn by the game\u2019s non-player characters, Mitton looked at late-60s fashion. It was an era in which people were moving away from tailored clothes, toward expressive fashion with lots of new fabrics and printing technologies. \u201cWith swinging London,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople really took hold of their look, they joined fashion gangs. We looked at Twiggy, she really brought forward that whole ready-to-wear, off-the-rack look. People would choose clothing and assemble their own style. We\u2019re still Arkane, though, so we always look at the lines, we make sure everything reflects the light beautifully, we looked at new shaders for the different fabrics \u2026\u201d\nThe decision to have all the characters wear masks was partly technological (it\u2019s still difficult to portray authentic emotions on the face of a game character), but it was also about the idea of using fashion, design and art to express emotion. Aeon is living like an endless party, so it made sense to express this in the decoration of the streets and buildings \u2013 such as the coloured powders used in Hindu festivals, or the paint-throwing in the Cascamorras festivals of Andalucia, or of course, the vast street murals of the hippy era. \u201cI mean sometimes they\u2019d paint entire building facades,\u201d says Mitton. \u201cThere are pubs in London that were entirely painted, even the roof tiles, and these were exterior projections of their emotions: this is our party, our place. For the people of Aeon, why not just live an exalted crazy life?!\u201d I think that\u2019s why the world of Deathloop is so arresting and explorable \u2013 it isn\u2019t just a pastiche of historical architecture and design. Everything has a place in the fiction of the world, and everything expresses an underlying theme or idea. As Mitton puts it, \u201cwe looked at the Beatles and Rolling Stones, but we tried to understand what was cool about those haircuts, and what was just too goofy.\u201d He pauses for a second before adding. \u201cThat took us a really long time.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/nov/03/deathloop-how-arkane-used-frank-lloyd-wright-tarantino-and-twiggy-to-build-a-world", "last_update": "2021-11-03T10:11:06Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Nuclear arms hawks give bureaucratic mauling to Biden vow to curb arsenal", "article": "A battle is being fought in Washington over the Biden administration\u2019s nuclear weapons policy, amid fears by arms control advocates that the president will renege on campaign promises to rein in the US arsenal. The battlegrounds are a nuclear posture review (NPR) due early next year and a defence budget expected about the same time. At stake is a chance to put the brakes on an arms race between the US, Russia and China \u2013 or the risk of that race accelerating.\nDespite Biden\u2019s pledge during the campaign \u2013 and in his interim national security guidance issued in March \u2013 that his administration would reduce \u201cour reliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons\u201d, hawks at the Pentagon have won the early skirmishes. Biden is also under pressure from some allies, nervous about Biden\u2019s past support for limiting the use of nuclear weapons to the \u201csole purpose\u201d of deterring, and retaliating against, a nuclear attack on the US or its allies. The current US posture is broader, leaving open a nuclear response to \u201csignificant non-nuclear strategic attacks\u201d. Britain and France also retain a certain amount of ambiguity about when they would use their weapons, and are concerned a US change to \u201csole purpose\u201d would oblige them ultimately to narrow their options. Paris has taken the lead in conveying those anxieties, and Emmanuel Macron raised nuclear posture issues with Biden when the two met in Rome on Friday. The big struggle, however, is on the home front, where arms control advocates are on the defensive. The administration\u2019s first defence budget in February included $43bn for an array of nuclear modernisation schemes, including controversial programmes introduced by Donald Trump, like a new sea-launched cruise missile. The total cost of modernisation could be over $1.5 trillion. In September, one of Biden\u2019s political appointees at the Pentagon, Leonor Tomero, who questioned the need for such a vast and growing nuclear weapons budget, was forced out in a bureaucratic power struggle after just nine months in the post. Her job had been to oversee the drafting of the NPR, which sets out what nuclear weapons the US should have and under what conditions they could be used. The official reason for Tomero\u2019s departure was that her job as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy had disappeared as part of efforts to streamline the Pentagon bureaucracy. \u201cThis transition of her duties is the result of a reorganization decision designed to more appropriately align the policy\u2019s shop structure with policy objectives,\u201d John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. \u201cThe nuclear posture review continues and is being handled by a large group of experts from across the department under the purview of the under secretary for policy.\u201d But several congressional sources said that her departure came after pressure from a Republican hardliner, Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch supporter of the nuclear weapons establishment, who threatened to hold up confirmations of senior Biden nominees if Tomero was not removed.\nSenator Fischer\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. A Pentagon spokesman said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any information to provide on this, but generally we cannot comment on personal discussions between department leadership and members of Congress.\u201d \u201cIt seems like the minute she got there she was under attack from people who were working behind the scenes, with congressional Republicans, to put pressure on senior Pentagon officials to get rid of Leonor,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert in nuclear non-proliferation and geopolitics at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cThis is all about making progressive views on nuclear weapons unacceptable.\u201d Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, has written to Biden demanding to know why Tomero had been removed in the midst of drafting the NPR, demanding to know if \u201cideology played any role\u201d. Arms control advocates complain the Democrats have not been as ruthless as Republicans in pursuit of their policies. A Trump appointee, Drew Walter, a former senior Republican staffer on the House armed services committee, has been allowed to \u201cburrow in\u201d as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear matters, converting from a political appointee to a career official. Tomero was Walter\u2019s Democratic counterpart when they were in Congress, but the Biden administration failed to protect her once she moved to the Pentagon. Nickolas Roth, the director of the nuclear security programme at the Stimson Center thinktank, said: \u201cI am concerned that the removal of Leonor from her position will have a chilling effect throughout the Biden administration, on those who might be willing to propose anything other than the status quo for US nuclear weapons policy.\u201d The deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, played down concerns that conservatives in the Pentagon would be able to shape the NPR. \u201cThis is going to be the president\u2019s posture review and the president\u2019s policy,\u201d Finer insisted at a Ploughshares Fund event last month. \u201cHe has asked the Pentagon, as has been the tradition in the past, to take the lead on drafting the posture review \u2026 but by the time we get to the end, it will be the president\u2019s document.\u201d With that in mind, Democrats have been reminding Biden that every dollar spent on weapons programmes inherited from his predecessors is a dollar less spent on the social aspirations of the administration. \u201cThe administration must harness this opportunity to rethink the status quo and not just rubber-stamp the Pentagon and defense industry\u2019s interest in continuing unnecessary weapons,\u201d Senator Jeff Merkley told the Guardian. \u201cBusiness as usual risks fuelling an unnecessary arms race and squanders billions of dollars that could go towards improving Americans\u2019 health, education and housing costs or better investments in national security.\u201d\nThe White House has sought to placate Democrats by agreeing to an independent review of the feasibility of extending the life of the current Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, compared with replacing with it a new weapon, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The review is expected to deliver its conclusions next year, although as the review panel has been selected by the Pentagon, it is not expected to upset plans to go ahead with the $100bn GBSD.\nChina\u2019s nuclear weapons development, including the recent reported testing of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glider launched from orbit, has increased the political pressure on Biden to abandon his arms control pledges, although the Chinese arsenal is still dwarfed by the US total of 3,750 warheads. Emma Belcher, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control advocacy organisation, argued that China\u2019s rise as a nuclear weapons power only underlines the urgency of arms control. \u201cThe best way to control the situation and head off an arms race with China is through diplomacy and restraint,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before. It\u2019s expensive and dangerous. So what we\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll see from the NPR is for diplomacy to be put first, and an off ramp from a new kind of cold war.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/nuclear-arms-joe-biden-pentagon-hawks", "last_update": "2021-11-03T03:24:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Linacre College says it will ask the privy council for permission to change its name to Thao College after signing a memorandum of understanding over the money with Sovico Group \u2013 represented by its chair, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. The graduate college, founded in 1962, is named after the Renaissance humanist, medical scientist and classicist Thomas Linacre. The donation will help to pay for a new graduate centre and graduate access scholarships, the college has said. \u201cWe have long been one of the least well-endowed colleges at the university, so we are delighted that a significant part of the donation will be for our general endowment fund, to help support the daily running of college,\u201d it said.\n\u201cSovico Group has also committed to all their subsidiaries reaching net zero carbon by the end of 2050 with the input from leading Oxford academics. \u201cAfter receiving the first donation of \u00a350m, we will approach the privy council to ask for permission to change our name from Linacre College to Thao College in recognition of this landmark gift.\u201d At Oxford there has been disquiet over Thao\u2019s donation to the institution, which has styled itself as \u201cone of the greenest colleges in Oxford\u201d. Sovico\u2019s business interests include offshore oil and gas exploration, fossil fuel financing, and Vietnam\u2019s first private airline. According to the Tab, Thao made much of her fortune from the budget airline VietJet Air, which is controlled by Sovico. The conglomerate is also the largest shareholder in HDBank, on the board of which she also serves as vice-chair. HDBank is the main financer of the state-owned Vietnam National Petroleum Group. Dr Maria Kawthar Daouda, a lecturer in French literature at Oxford, told the Telegraph college names should not be altered simply because \u201ca major gift has been made\u201d. \u201cThankfulness for Madam Thao\u2019s money could be expressed in ways that do not erase what the donation is meant to protect,\u201d Daouda said.

{"title": "UK house prices climb but outlook for market \u2018extremely uncertain\u2019", "article": "Average UK house prices defied expectations and continued to climb last month despite the phasing out of the government\u2019s stamp duty holiday at the end of September. The continued increases mean that the price of an average home in the UK has risen above \u00a3250,000 for the first time on the building society Nationwide\u2019s index. Other house price indices have already recorded UK averages above a quarter of a million pounds. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics based on mortgage completions put the average price at \u00a3264,000 in August, while the Halifax building society suggested the milestone was passed in October 2020.\nNationwide said house prices increased by 0.7% in October this year from a month earlier, meaning the price of the average property has gone up by more than \u00a330,000 since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020. Meanwhile, year-on-year property price inflation remained at the high level of 9.9% last month, only just below the 10% level recorded in September. The threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3250,000 in July, before the tax break came to an end in September. \u201cDemand for homes has remained strong despite the expiry of the stamp duty holiday at the end of September,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. \u201cCombined with a lack of homes on the market, this helps to explain why price growth has remained robust.\u201d There had been expectations that demand for house purchases would slow after the threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3250,000 in July, and the tax break then came to an end in September. However, it is unclear whether house prices will continue to rise in the coming months and Gardner called the outlook for the housing market \u201cextremely uncertain\u201d. Further property price inflation is dependent on a range of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence and employment levels after the end of government pandemic support measures including the furlough scheme.\n\u201cIf the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months \u2013 especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity,\u201d Gardner said, adding that interest rate rises could cool the market. The Bank of England will reveal its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. Financial markets are betting on a rate rise, as a result of rising inflation, although most City economists expect rates to remain at record lows for the moment. Any rate rises over the coming months are forecast to be gradual and are not expected to have a strong impact on UK borrowers.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/03/uk-house-prices-climb-but-outlook-for-market-extremely-uncertain", "last_update": "2021-11-03T09:22:34Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "French drama can\u2019t hide real story from Cop26: Scott Morrison\u2019s promise to do hardly anything", "article": "There weren\u2019t many silver linings for Scott Morrison in his extraordinary skirmish with Emmanuel Macron, but one may be that it has distracted public attention from the prime minister\u2019s threadbare performance at the Glasgow climate summit. As Morrison and other leaders flew home from the ongoing talks on Tuesday, observers were tallying up what the prime minister had committed to do at a meeting billed as the best, last chance to deal with the climate crisis. It didn\u2019t take long. Attention then turned to a more significant list: what the Australian government has not committed to doing. At the top is one that we have known for a while: it made no commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions rapidly, as scientific advice says is necessary. This was the central point of the Glasgow summit \u2013 to ramp up action this decade, as was agreed under the ratchet mechanism of the Paris agreement. Countries are expected to lift their short-term commitments over time on the way to carbon neutrality.\nThe rule of thumb is that global emissions need to be cut roughly in half this decade. That means substantial action from all major emitters, particularly the wealthy. New commitments offered haven\u2019t even come close to that, but they have increased over the past year. The G7 developed nations and the European Union are all promising at least a 40% emissions cut by 2030 compared with (give or take) their highest polluting year. India, the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter, this week promised that half its electricity would be renewable by then. Even China, which drew strong and understandable condemnation from Joe Biden for president Xi Jinping\u2019s non-appearance in Glasgow, offered a meagre increase on its 2030 pledges the week before the summit. Australia didn\u2019t manage that. Morrison went to Glasgow armed with the same short-term emissions reduction target (a 26-28% cut compared with 2005) set under Tony Abbott six years ago. The prime minister was in the awkward position of having to tell the summit in his speech that the country would probably make a 35% emissions cut by 2030 \u2013 official government projections said so \u2013 but that he would not commit to doing it. Morrison announced some new climate financing to help the least developed and most vulnerable, as wealthy nations have promised. The prime minister described it \u2013 and it was reported in some media \u2013 as a $2bn commitment. In reality there was only $500m additional funding spread over five years, making the new pledge $100m a year towards an annual global goal of $100bn. It was significantly less than what many comparable countries have offered. Morrison said Australia would continue to bypass the global Green Climate Fund and fund projects in the Indo-Pacific directly.\nBeyond that, there were two set-piece pledges by national leaders that drew attention. Australia signed up to one and rejected the other. The \u201cyes\u201d was to a declaration that global deforestation would be halted and reversed by 2030. Officials were slow to confirm Australia supported the initiative. Once they had, the assistant forestry minister, Jonno Duniam, was quick to say it would not require the country to stop native forest logging. The declaration\u2019s main goal is to build support for protecting ecosystems in developing countries where vast areas are being felled for agriculture. The \u201cno\u2019\u2019 was to a global pledge to cut emissions of methane \u2013 a short-lived but incredibly potent greenhouse gas \u2013 by 30% by 2030. More than 80 countries signed up. Those who didn\u2019t included China, India and Russia. Meeting the methane goal would have required significant action to limit emissions from coalmines and gas fields \u2013 something the Morrison government has indicated it isn\u2019t prepared to do. Instead, it muddied the waters, falsely claiming it would have required farmers to shoot their cattle. Unsurprisingly, given its well-documented lack of ambition, Australia is not part of the high ambition coalition, which aims to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a goal that is supposed to be at the heart of the climate negotiations process. It did sign up to the Glasgow breakthrough agenda, a collection of five goals launched by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. These goals are technology focused \u2013 the Morrison government\u2019s preferred territory \u2013 and vaguely defined, but a couple are worth noting. One is that clean power will be the \u201cmost affordable and reliable option for all countries\u201d by 2030. The important word here is \u201cclean\u201d, which the Morrison government usually defines as including gas, a fossil fuel. Another is that zero emissions vehicles will become the \u201cnew normal\u201d and \u201caccessible, affordable and sustainable\u201d in all regions in 2030. This is clearly at odds with the Coalition\u2019s politically motivated \u201cend the weekend\u201d attack on electric vehicles before the 2019 election, but the government has been gradually inching away from that statement ever since (though not enough to give EV technology the support it receives in other countries). A key point about the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d goals is that none are binding, or specific enough to demand new policies. No one has to do anything. Sound familiar? As the emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor put it on Tuesday, they \u201calign strongly with Australia\u2019s approach\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/the-pm-goes-to-glasgow-or-what-scott-morrison-didnt-do-at-cop26", "last_update": "2021-11-03T09:16:43Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Oh my god, we can\u2019t do this!\u2019 Inside Levi\u2019s sexy, hit-making ads of the 90s", "article": "Amid black and white Ansel Adams-style cinematography, two Amish sisters spy on a topless man bathing in a Yosemite river. Suddenly, a peaceful choral soundtrack gave gives way to bone-shaking guitar: Inside, the debut single by Scottish grunge band Stiltskin. Thus began one of the strangest cultural wrinkles of the 1990s: when Levi\u2019s became a jeans company that could also score UK chart hits. Inside was built around an addictive riff that still sounds fresh, and the advert, entitled Creek, shot it to the top of the UK charts. Over the next few years, the likes of Babylon Zoo, Smoke City, Mr Oizo and Norman Cook\u2019s pre-Fatboy Slim project Freak Power would also score major success off the back of a placement in Levi\u2019s witty, often sexually provocative adverts. Before Stiltskin, previous Levi\u2019s ads had made renewed hits out of Muddy Waters\u2019 Mannish Boy, the Clash\u2019s Should I Stay or Should I Go and Marvin Gaye\u2019s I Heard It Through the Grapevine (the latter in 1985\u2019s classic, Nick Kamen-in-his-boxers \u201cLaundrette\u201d ad). The brand used classic blues, rock and soul to embody the brand\u2019s sense of vintage authenticity. Inside, though, was the first time the company had used a new artist as their soundtrack. \u201cWhen you\u2019re selling the same basic product in the world of fashion, you have to change something,\u201d explains Sir John Hegarty, the creative director at London-based creative agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), who ran the 80s and 90s Levi\u2019s campaigns. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the clothes. So we used the communication as a way of saying: we\u2019re discovering music, we\u2019re ahead of fashion.\u201d\n\u201cMy house was being repossessed because I couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage,\u201d says Stiltskin singer (and later Genesis vocalist) Ray Wilson, recalling his audition for the band in January 1994. \u201cI signed on the dole and drove down to London in this old Volkswagen van that was falling apart. Weeks after, we were No 1.\u201d Released 20 days after Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide, the song landed in a musical landscape overrun with grunge bands emulating the 90s Seattle sound. Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, convinced Inside ripped off their sound, greeted a Munich crowd later that year with a wry, \u201cHi, we\u2019re Stiltskin!\u201d The band never had another hit, something Wilson chalks up to \u201ctoo much success too quickly. You can\u2019t go up from there \u2013 it\u2019s not the best way to start a band\u2019s career. We came together within weeks, so we didn\u2019t have a relationship. We ended up hating each other.\u201d That anger bled into the band\u2019s performances. \u201cWe did MTV\u2019s Most Wanted and we were told there was something in the region of 20 million viewers,\u201d he continues. \u201cMe and [guitarist and songwriter] Peter were at each other. He kicked me in the face. On one hand MTV were pissed off, but that little clip of Peter kicking me and the microphone flying out of my hand \u2013 they used that for 12 months on their trailers.\u201d Having your track selected by Levi\u2019s was enough to at least guarantee a chart hit, albeit not longevity \u2013 but even fleeting success was a temptation. \u201cThe music industry went from: \u2018I don\u2019t want to touch advertising\u2019, to completely swinging round to: \u2018Please can we have some of our music in your ad\u2019,\u201d recalls Hegarty. \u201cIt was that winning-the-lottery phone call,\u201d says Fatboy Slim, AKA Norman Cook, who, in 1995, was playing keyboards in acid-jazz troupe Freak Power. \u201cWe were slogging around clubs playing gigs and frankly, we weren\u2019t setting the world alight. We needed something to kick us up a division.\u201d Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out had reached No 29 when it was first released, but went Top 5 after being re-released and selected to feature in the 1995 Levi\u2019s ad Taxi. The commercial showed Filipino-American fashion designer Zaldy, now better known for making RuPaul\u2019s outfits on Drag Race, taking a New York taxi in drag, and shocking the cab driver by shaving her chin mid-drive. Airing at a time when there was little in the way of LGBTQ+ representation in advertising, it was almost banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, who finally agreed it could be shown after 8pm. \u201cThe main client [at Levi\u2019s] at the time was like, \u2018Oh my god, we can\u2019t do this\u2019,\u201d remembers Hegarty. \u201cThe people underneath him had to go and convince him it was going to be great.\u201d\n\u201cThere was one cut I really liked where the whole track stops when the shaver came on, which also sounded kind of like a vibrator,\u201d says Cook. \u201cI was very proud of the fact it had this slightly risque subject matter [for the time].\u201d Most people who grew up in the 90s will cite Babylon Zoo\u2019s 1995 industrial-glam hit Spaceman as the Levi\u2019s ad song they remember best. Although, as Hegarty reveals, the collaboration almost didn\u2019t happen. \u201c[Vocalist Jas Mann] didn\u2019t want to do it and his manager said, \u2018Are you fucking stupid? This is going to make you\u2019.\u201d It would go on to become the fastest-selling British single since the Beatles\u2019 Can\u2019t Buy Me Love, despite widespread disappointment that the pitched-up snippet in the ad wasn\u2019t representative of the overall track. \u201cMillions of pop kids rushed down Woolies and bought the single \u2013 only to get it home to discover to their horror that it was \u2018good\u2019 (like in the advert) for about 10 seconds,\u201d Steven Wells wrote in the NME. \u201cThen became rubbish. Very rubbish.\u201d\nStill, the Levi\u2019s cachet continued to rise through the 1990s, and BBH commissioned well-known names to helm their commercials. In 1997, Roman Coppola directed the Brady Bunch-inspired commercial Daytrippers, soundtracked by US indie band Lilys\u2019 psych-pop track, A Nanny in Manhattan. The song reached No 16 in the UK \u2013 their only major chart success. Vocalist Kurt Heasley remembers he felt pressured to follow up with music people could \u201cinstantly grasp by the second chorus. We\u2019re this weird, rare, odd thing and people were like, \u2018More meat! More potato!\u2019 We\u2019re more like truffle oil on chips.\u201d Also in 1997, Michel Gondry, who would later direct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and more, was hired to film the raunchy spot Mermaids. For Smoke City\u2019s Brazilian-British vocalist Nina Miranda, Gondry\u2019s sensual advert, which featured a pod of mermaids attempting to relieve a man of his Levi 501s in the ocean, conjured a sense of escapism. \u201cLevi\u2019s ads were weird little messages in a bottle from an exotic place somewhere else,\u201d she says. Miranda had written the track in 1993, long before Levi\u2019s came calling: \u201cI was really depressed and living in London. I used to sit in my room, putting ideas to tape. A DJ friend said: \u2018I\u2019m going to make a song just for you\u2019. I put it on, without having heard it before, and I sang what I felt which was this incredible trip into water.\u201d Underwater Love became an underground hit and sparked a bidding war \u2013 but once signed to Zumba Records, Smoke City were frustrated to find the label wouldn\u2019t promote their debut album, Flying Away, after the Levi\u2019s ad was confirmed, because they considered the ad such an effective marketing tool on its own. \u201cWe were saying, \u2018please promote the album\u2019, because already people were saying we were one-hit wonders,\u201d Miranda remembers, though she believes the commercial was still a blessing rather than a curse. \u201cThat song went all over the world. It opened a lot of doors and people still remember it.\u201d BBH\u2019s final Levi\u2019s ad of the 90s would be their most successful of the decade. It featured a headbanging, fluffy yellow puppet called Flat Eric. Soundtracked by Flat Beat, French DJ-producer Mr Oizo\u2019s influential bass anthem, it was a concept Hegarty had to pitch three times in order to get over the finish line. The single sold millions of copies, spent two weeks at No 1 in March 1999, and spawned think pieces that pondered Flat Eric\u2019s position at the intersection of consumerism and popular culture.\nBut Flat Beat would be the last song to become a major hit after appearing on a Levi\u2019s ad and BBH turned away from using original artists in the 2000s. That 90s run is a feat Hegarty thinks could never happen again. \u201cThe way advertising works today, it doesn\u2019t have quite the confidence \u2013 or if I can use that word \u2018swagger\u2019 \u2013 as it had back then,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have lost confidence in those big brand statements about what we are, who we are, how we behave.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose the modern equivalent would be to have a TikTok hit,\u201d says Cook, who recently pondered joining the social network with his manager and label. \u201cWe went to TikTok and asked, \u2018We know how to get records on the radio, but how do we get them here?\u2019 And they said, \u2018They just grow ergonomically or organically.\u2019 It\u2019s not an algorithm that can be influenced.\u201d The difference, Hegarty says, is the way that the world is fragmented today through social media. \u201cThere\u2019s always a relationship between music and clothing \u2013 the trouble is you\u2019ve not got anyone going out there making a big statement about it and leading the market,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone always says to me, \u2018How do you predict fashion?\u2019 You can\u2019t predict fashion. What you can do is write interesting, challenging, distinctive little stories and that way, you might have an influence.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/03/levis-ads-of-the-90s-no1-stiltskin-mr-oizo-babylon-zoo", "last_update": "2021-10-28T10:21:24Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Facial recognition firm Clearview AI to appeal order to stop collecting images of Australians", "article": "Facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to cease collecting photos of Australians from the internet, after it was revealed police in some states had trialled the technology. On Wednesday, the information and privacy commissioner determined Clearview AI had breached the privacy of Australians by collecting images of them online, and ordered the company to delete all images of people in Australia within 90 days and not collect any more. \u201cWhen Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don\u2019t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes,\u201d commissioner Angelene Falk said. \u201cThe indiscriminate scraping of people\u2019s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.\u201d But Clearview AI has stood its ground, saying it operates legitimately in Australia and intends to appeal the decision. Clearview AI is a facial recognition service that claims to have built up enormous databases \u2013 containing more than 3bn labelled faces \u2013 through the controversial practice of scraping photos from Facebook and other social media sites. Last year, it was revealed the US-based company had offered trial services to police in Australia \u2013 specifically Queensland police, Victoria police and the Australian federal police. Reports suggested more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the globe had been using Clearview\u2019s services in early 2020.\nIn response to the scandal, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) launched an investigation in cooperation with the UK\u2019s information commissioner office in July 2020. Clearview AI stands ground Mark Love, a lawyer for BAL Lawyers acting for Clearview AI, said the company had gone to \u201cconsiderable lengths\u201d to cooperate, and claimed \u201cthe commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI conducts it business\u201d. He said Clearview AI intends to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. \u201cClearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only has the commissioner\u2019s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI\u2019s manner of operation, the commissioner lacks jurisdiction.\u201d The Australian founder and CEO of Clearview AI, Hoan Ton-That, said he respects the effort the commissioner put into evaluating the technology he built but said he is \u201cdisheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to society\u201d. In its response to the OAIC, Clearview AI argued its images were collected from the internet without requiring a password or other security clearance. The company also said the images held by Clearview AI were published in the US, not Australia, so Australian privacy law should not apply. The OAIC report noted Clearview AI has not offered services to Australian organisations since March 2020, but the commissioner said that didn\u2019t go far enough and all images of people in Australia must be removed. Police forces in Australia have downplayed their use of the service, and the OAIC\u2019s investigation found Clearview did not have any paid customers in Australia. However, the OAIC report found officers in Australia had successfully searched for suspects, victims and themselves in the Clearview databases. The OAIC is still finalising a report on the AFP\u2019s trial of the technology and whether it complied with the federal privacy code for government agencies.\nThe ABC reported last year through documents obtained under freedom of information law that at least one officer tested the software using photos of herself and another member of staff, while the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation conducted searches for five \u201cpersons of interest\u201d. The UK\u2019s ICO is separately considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action under the UK\u2019s data protection laws. It is the second ruling the OAIC has made against facial recognition technology this year, after a similar finding was made against convenience store giant 7-Eleven last month over the collection of facial images of people filling out customer surveys across 700 stores, in a bid to weed out fake responses. Facebook this week also announced a move away from the use of facial recognition technology on its platform, citing concerns over privacy and transparency around the use of the technology.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/facial-recognition-firm-cleaview-ai-to-appeal-order-to-stop-collecting-images-of-australians", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:59:07Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Has a manager of the month been sacked faster than Tottenham\u2019s Nuno? | The Knowledge", "article": "\u201cNuno Esp\u00edrito Santo won the manager of the month award for August, but just 52 days later, he was sacked,\u201d writes Derek Robertson. \u201cIs this a Premier League record or has someone else had an even more precipitous fall from grace?\u201d Such is the thirst for change in some club boardrooms, Nuno\u2019s rapid descent from August\u2019s best Premier League manager to unemployment can be beaten. Let\u2019s start at Sheffield Wednesday in 2000, where on 1 February Danny Wilson received the Premier League manager of the month award. Just 49 days later, on 21 March, he was cast out in the cold having won only one in six. On 6 February 2013 Reading\u2019s Brian McDermott was named manager of the month for January. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves a real chance of league survival,\u201d beamed McDermott. Four straight defeats and 33 days later, McDermott was given his marching orders. Predictably, Reading went on to be relegated.\nWe really ought to take a look at Chelsea, though. The winds of change blow fiercely in SW6. Claudio Ranieri was sacked 59 days after winning the March award in 2004, so quick but not quick enough. Success at this time of year would appear to be deadly for Chelsea managers. Rafa Ben\u00edtez won the April award in 2013 and was let go on 28 May after winning the Europa League, though he was only ever an interim manager, as Blues fans were so fond of reminding him. Five years earlier, Avram Grant was handed the April 2008 award on 9 May and was tossed out of Stamford Bridge a mere 16 days later (25 May) after the Blues finished second, two points behind Manchester United. Surely, no one can beat that? No, but the same club can equal it. Carlo Ancelotti was named manager of the month for April on 6 May 2011, with the Premier League panel being impressed after Chelsea\u2019s \u201cthree consecutive home wins over Birmingham, West Ham and Tottenham\u201d gave them \u201cmomentum into their pivotal match with the league leaders\u201d Manchester United. They lost 2-1 and after a draw with Newcastle and a defeat at Everton, the champions finished second to United. Ancelotti was sent packing on 22 May, 16 days later. Had the Premier League not handed Ancelotti the award as early in the month as they did, then the Italian could have won this Knowledge segment instead of sharing the honour with Grant. Four years later, history repeated itself for poor Carlo. He was sent packing by second-placed Real Madrid on 25 May, having received April\u2019s La Liga manager of the month award on 7 May (a gap of only 18 days). Brits abroad scoring in Europe \u201cOn 30 September Chris Smalling and Tammy Abraham both scored for Roma in a European tie v Zorya Luhansk. How many times has more than one English (or even British) player scored for a European/non-British club in a European competition?\u201d asks Kenn Rushworth. Such was a certain reluctance of British players to regularly pursue careers in Europe until recently, the answer is not that often, Kenn, but Dirk Maas has plucked out a couple of examples. \u201cJonathan Woodgate and David Beckham scored for Real Madrid against Rosenborg in a Champions League 2005-06 group stage match,\u201d writes Dirk, who deserves a pat on the back for managing to mention Woodgate and Real Madrid in a positive light.\n\u201cAnd Mark Pembridge and Brian Deane contributed to a comfortable 6-0 victory for Benfica over Beitar Jerusalem in a second qualification round of the Champions League in 1998-99. At that time Benfica served as a British enclave during Graeme Souness\u2019s reign, with players such as Scott Minto, Deane, Dean Saunders, Pembridge, Michael Thomas, Steve Harkness and Gary Charles passing through.\u201d Perfect homes \u201cIn the 1929-30 season, Brentford won all 21 home games,\u201d writes David Daniels. \u201cHas any other club achieved this feat, either domestically or abroad?\u201d Yes, they have and here\u2019s Gary Cumberland with the rundown. \u201cBrentford are actually the sixth club to do it, although they did it with a lot more home games in their season. The other unbeaten home teams were: 1891-92 Sunderland (won all 13 home games) 1893-94 Liverpool (14 home games) 1894-95 Bury (15 home games) 1899-00 Sheffield Wednesday (as The Wednesday) (17 home games) 1902-03 Birmingham City (as Small Heath) (17 home games) 1929-30 Brentford (21 home games) \u201cOne interesting note is that even though they went 100% at home, Brentford (and Birmingham in 1903) didn\u2019t even win their leagues! In fact, Brentford were a whopping seven points behind Plymouth Argyle, back when a win was worth only two points.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cI am interested in learning the origins of the expression that a defence was at \u2018sixes and sevens\u2019 in dealing with an attack,\u201d wrote Eric Willis in October 2005. \u201cCan you help?\u201d Off to www.wordorigins.org to answer this one, Eric, which stated: \u201c\u2018At sixes and sevens\u2019 is a very old catchphrase and relates to gambling. It first appears c.1374 in Chaucer\u2019s Troylus. The original phrasing was \u2018set upon six and seven\u2019. It referred to betting one\u2019s entire fortune on one throw of the dice [this, it transpires, being a game called \u2018hazard\u2019, more commonly known as craps]. It connoted carelessness, and over time the phrase came to mean confusion, disorder, and disagreement.\u201d Apparently a plural form, \u2018to leave at sixes and sevens\u2019, was developed in the 1800s; it was still based on the same gambling metaphor, but the idiom was now used to signify a kind of confusion or neglect, rather that pure risk taking.\nCan you help? \u201cLast Saturday Newcastle lost 3-0, Middlesbrough lost 2-0, Hull lost 1-0, Sunderland lost 5-1 and Hartlepool lost 5-0,\u201d begins Christopher Lutton. \u201cHas the north-east ever had a worse footballing day?\u201d\n\u201cMy youngest son plays U-18 football and the coaches set up on either side of pitch and coach from there throughout the game,\u201d writes Andrew Walker Thornton. \u201cIs there any examples in the professional game of opposing dugouts on opposite sides of the pitch.\u201d\n\u201cIbrahima Konat\u00e9 has played at Old Trafford twice in his career so far.

{"title": "The Premise review \u2013 tasteless TV that will leave you feeling grubby", "article": "The premise of The Premise (Disney+) is vague enough to require an explanation from its creator, BJ Novak, before it begins. This to-camera introduction gives it an old-fashioned feel \u2013 which is jarring, because it sets itself up as a very modern show. The trailer calls it \u201can anthology of now\u201d, although that only muddies the waters. Essentially, it is a short comedy-drama series. Each episode has a discrete cast and a discrete story that takes a modern concern and forms it into a plot. It feels like an exercise in creative writing \u2013 an ambitious idea more than the successful execution of an ambitious idea. And, on the basis of the opening double bill, it doesn\u2019t quite land. The first episode, Social Justice Sex Tape \u2013 how\u2019s that for a hot-button title? \u2013 combines pornography, cancel culture, institutional racism and police brutality into an absurd legal comedy farce. Ben Platt stars as Ethan, a \u201cwoke bro\u201d type who lives in a gentrifying area, goes on marches, donates money to charity and vociferously tweets support for various anti-racism causes. While masturbating to a sex tape he made with an ex-girlfriend, he realises that he has captured evidence in the background that exonerates an innocent black man, Darren Williams, who is in prison awaiting trial.\nEver the ally, Ethan takes the tape to the lawyers defending Darren and agrees to let them show it in court, to prove that the police who arrested him are lying. If there is any sense of realism to start with, it is rapidly tossed aside, showing the video in full, graphic detail in the lawyers\u2019 office and in court, without sparing anyone\u2019s blushes by blurring or cropping out inessential parts. Here, the episode starts to founder and grab at straws, in trying to find the premise. One solid line of inquiry is the futility, or not, of online sloganeering; among the few moments that elicited a laugh was the state lawyer trawling through Ethan\u2019s Twitter history, pointing out that he called for the police to be abolished in one tweet and for more law enforcement at a Tame Impala concert in another. But this is a cheap joke. Other themes are thrown up with little thought about where they will land. Ethan\u2019s credibility as a witness is corroded with various accusations that his sex tape is a deep fake, that he is a crisis actor or an \u201cincel\u201d, or perhaps all of the above. The tape becomes about Ethan, his unique sexual style and whether or not he expected his life to be torn apart for coming forward with what he saw as evidence. It becomes more muddled as the farce stacks up. Is it about cancel culture or social justice? Privacy or activism? It seems coy about going too far while pushing a silly story to a chaotic conclusion. The second episode, Moment of Silence, is of more questionable taste. Jon Bernthal plays the grieving father of a five-year-old girl killed during a school shooting. He pursues a job doing PR for a prominent gun lobby, here called the NGL. Again, any notion of realism is thrown out as soon as the what-if-this-happened twist becomes clear. The organisation is thrilled with the coup of getting him on staff and asks him to observe a minute\u2019s silence for the anniversary of the shooting, which will be broadcast to the country. It will, they promise, have a big impact. What could possibly go wrong? The episode is a slow build towards a bleak resolution and is as sombre and grim as the first episode was ridiculous. Social Justice Sex Tape took an idea and had fun with it, but there is clearly no fun to be had in this. Instead, it settles for a self-satisfied told-you-so. It is unpleasant viewing for all sorts of reasons; it left me feeling grubby, rather than educated or provoked. Novak is an accomplished writer and actor, best known for the US version of The Office, but The Premise seems to take novel ideas and flatten them out. There are five episodes, with the final three examining trolling, celebrity worship and redemption, tied to the development of a butt plug. There is clearly ambition behind the first two episodes, but the later premises sound much more appealing \u2013 and like a far happier match between subject matter and tone.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/03/the-premise-review-tasteless-tv-that-will-leave-you-feeling-grubby", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:10:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Eddie Jones back to drawing board as withdrawals could force rethink | Robert Kitson", "article": "Either Eddie Jones has walked under a whole row of ladders or his England selection plans are falling victim to some other mystery curse. How else to account for the latest injury flurry which has removed a raft of backline options from contention before this weekend\u2019s game with Tonga, a fixture earmarked as a springboard to another potentially exciting new Twickenham era? In theory this was meant to be among the more upbeat weeks of Jones\u2019s tenure, with some promising youngsters being expertly blended into a team with a licence to sparkle like a Bonfire Night firework show. Instead, having jettisoned plenty of familiar faces for players such as Marcus Smith, Freddie Steward, Raffi Quirke and Louis Lynagh, several of the fresh-faced pretenders are struggling to make it out of the treatment room.\nThe aforementioned quartet plus Saracens\u2019 in-form Max Malins are all now either doubtful or non-starters for England\u2019s opening autumn Test, undermining Jones\u2019s efforts to assemble a go-faster three-quarter line before the Wallabies and the Springboks come to town. With Quirke, Malins and Lynagh definitely out because of injuries which originated at their clubs and Smith and Steward as yet unable to train fully this week, the \u201cnew England\u201d could end up looking remarkably like the old one. If Smith cannot start, in particular, several rainforests-worth of previews will need recasting. The primary aim from this fixture, from England\u2019s perspective, was to see how effectively the Harlequin could dovetail with Owen Farrell at 10 and 12. As it transpires, with Quirke also sidelined, the old firm of Farrell and Ben Youngs could be back, albeit with Northampton\u2019s uncapped Alex Mitchell on the bench. A penny for the thoughts of George Ford and Dan Robson, both of whom might have been suited to this fixture. In certain respects, though, Jones deserves limited sympathy, his indecision still apparently final. Already he is in the position of having to talk up Jamie George after brutally jettisoning the Saracens hooker only last month. Now George has been retained in his matchday squad ahead of Leicester\u2019s Nic Dolly, who was originally picked in front of him. If George is currently wondering which way is up, he is not alone.\nThere would be even less logic if George now starts and Newcastle\u2019s Jamie Blamire, another original pick, sits on the bench. And what about Sam Simmonds, good enough to make the summer Lions tour but also now sent back to his club before the Tonga game along with Newcastle\u2019s Callum Chick and Leicester\u2019s George Martin? Rumours persist, meanwhile, that Courtney Lawes will wear 6 and Tom Curry operate at 8 at certain times this autumn. If so, and the in-form Alex Dombrandt is \u201conly\u201d warming the bench against the Tongans, when will the Harlequins No 8 ever be wholly trusted?\nRound and round it continues to swirl. Is it actually more experimentation that England need or more far-sighted judgment, a better balance and greater stability? It is all very well Jones deciding Billy Vunipola may not make the 2023 World Cup, when he will be almost 31, but where does that leave Manu Tuilagi and Youngs who will be 32 and 34 respectively? Ma\u2019a Nonu was 33 when he carved up the 2015 World Cup final but what if Tuilagi cannot regain full throttle this autumn? It is remarkable to think, either way, that Jones has chosen 20 different centre pairings in his 66 Tests in charge and started his optimum pair together in just five of them. Between them Tuilagi and Henry Slade have pretty much everything a coach could wish for: power, a gainline-breaking threat, a sweet left boot and a nice outside break.\nThink back to the spectacular 32-20 win over Ireland in Dublin in the 2019 Six Nations, the 40-16 obliteration of Australia in the World Cup quarter-final in Oita and even when England stormed to a dramatic 31-0 lead versus Scotland in that dramatic 38-38 Calcutta Cup draw at Twickenham in 2019. The common denominator, every time, was a Tuilagi-Slade midfield combo. So if Smith\u2019s \u201cminor leg injury\u201d forces him either to the bench or out of the 23 entirely, the silver lining could see Farrell lining up in his best position on his 100th Test appearance and everyone else finally being able to gauge whether England\u2019s issues stemmed more from how they were previously being told to play than the personnel involved. With Adam Radwan and Jonny May on the wings there should still be oodles of pace and opportunity could also yet knock for George Furbank.

The charities provide a lifeline to refugees who are hoping to seek sanctuary in the UK, often attempting Channel crossings by small boats. The deteriorating weather as winter approaches makes living conditions for the estimated 2,000 migrants in Calais, who are destitute and often forced to sleep outside, more precarious.\nIn a statement the charities said: \u201cWe may no longer be able to continue our work after December. If we were to leave Calais there would be dangerous gaps left in the provision of basic warmth, shelter and food.\u201d Choose Love has raised \u00a335m, works in 22 countries to support refugees and has supported 300 projects. It is backed by celebrities from the worlds of music, fashion and acting including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, Olivia Colman and Stella McCartney. The charities affected include Calais Food Collective, Refugee Info Bus and Refugee Women\u2019s Centre. Between them, the seven aid groups provide food people can cook themselves, prepared meals, water, firewood, dry clothing and footwear, blankets, tarpaulins, phone charging points and information services. Choose Love started in the summer of 2015 in response to the worsening situation for refugees in Europe, when a group of volunteers planned to take a van full of donations and raise \u00a31,000 for refugees in Calais. It became almost overnight the largest aid operation in northern France. In a statement issued on Instagram on Tuesday 2 November Choose Love announced that they would no longer be funding many of the smaller NGOs working on the frontline with refugees in Calais and Dunkirk. They will, however, continue to support two charities working with unaccompanied minors in the area \u2013 Safe Passage and ECPAT. Choose Love said: \u201cThis year we find ourselves in a place where we have had to make some difficult decisions and we have news which we are delivering with heavy hearts.\u201d It said it had initiated a strategic review and that many factors, including the pandemic, were behind the decision to withdraw funds. The seven charities which will no longer receive funds from Choose Love say that between them they are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds and that for some of them their entire income will be affected.\nA spokesperson for Refugee Info Bus said: \u201cFunding from Choose Love supported our vital services and filled a major gap left by governments and large NGOs. Their withdrawal is a serious blow which will have real consequences in Calais. A working phone is a lifeline here. Our teams are established and accepted within the communities in Calais but the funding situation poses a real risk. Last week Info Bus helped more than 500 people charge their phones and access the internet. The dire humanitarian situation in Calais continues and with the harsh winter approaching we are urgently seeking alternative funds.\u201d A spokesperson for Calais Food Collective said: \u201cWe will be greatly affected by the withdrawal of support from Choose Love. It is vitally important that our essential services are not scaled back \u2013 a permanent water supply for those who have no other water source, food and cooking equipment are invaluable to those in a state of near permanent precarity.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cPeople should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. It is dangerous to encourage these Channel crossings, which are illegal, unnecessary and facilitated by violent criminal gangs profiting from misery. We are working with the French to stop boats leaving their beaches and crack down on the criminals driving these crossings.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/refugee-aid-in-northern-france-at-risk-as-choose-life-ends-funding", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:05:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Holmes, an expert on the evolution of viral diseases, publicly shared the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the first time in January last year, publishing it on behalf of a consortium of Chinese scientists. For nearly three decades Holmes has studied how viruses evolve and jump between species. His research has focused on pathogens including HIV, Ebola and Zika, and his work on the emergence and origins of Covid-19 earned him recognition in 2020 as the New South Wales scientist of the year. Holmes described the recognition as a \u201ctruly humbling experience\u201d.\nAmong the other research achievements honoured in Wednesday\u2019s awards were the development of biomaterials to repair wounds, decoding mysterious signals in the distant universe, and treatments to improve the survival of breast cancer patients. The prizes, in their 22nd year, are Australia\u2019s most prestigious awards for achievements in scientific research, innovation and teaching. Prof Anthony Weiss, also of the University of Sydney, won the prime minister\u2019s prize for innovation, for developing biomaterials that can accelerate and improve wound healing in human tissue. Both he and Holmes were awarded $250,000.\nWeiss was recognised for creating a synthetic version of tropoelastin, a protein building block that gives human tissue \u2013 including the skin, arteries and lungs \u2013 its elasticity. \u201cEach of these little bricks is only 20 nanometers in size,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to assemble them into fibres and sheets and tubes.\u201d The tropoelastin is used in injectables for localised tissue damage, or as implants in larger wounds, to help speed up tissue repair after injury. The biomaterial is produced at scale by specially programmed bacteria. \u201cWe just basically crack open the bacterial cells and out pops out our tropoelastin,\u201d Weiss said. Weiss founded the firm Elastogen in 2008 to commercialise the research. The company was sold to one of the world\u2019s biggest biopharmaceutical firms in 2018, in a deal totalling $334m \u2013 one of the largest transactions in Australia\u2019s life science sector. Astronomer Dr Keith Bannister, of the CSIRO, was awarded the Malcolm McIntosh prize for physical scientist of the year. Bannister designed a way of pinpointing where fast radio bursts (FRBs) \u2013 short pulses of radio waves \u2013 originate from in galaxies billions of light years away.\nBannister said it was gratifying to be recognised, emphasising that the work was a \u201chuge effort\u201d by a team of scientists. He compared detecting an FRB to \u201cfinding a needle in a haystack the size of 50 football fields\u201d. \u201cWhen we find one, within half a second we can actually reach inside the telescope and do a live-action replay [which helps locate it],\u201d Bannister said. What exactly produces FRBs is still a mystery of modern astronomy, with some speculating the signals from deep space could be a sign of alien life. Bannister is sceptical of this explanation, but said the energy released by an FRB in one millisecond was equivalent to what the sun released in 70 years. He encouraged young people \u201cto think about the Stem disciplines as a career, and also a way of being creative and a way of making a difference to the world\u201d. Prof Sherene Loi, an oncologist and researcher at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, took home the Frank Fenner prize for life scientist of the year. Loi\u2019s research led to a biomarker test for breast cancer, which is now routinely used in pathology reporting in many countries. She also helped prove that immunotherapy can prolong survival in patients with triple negative breast cancer, the most aggressive type of breast cancer.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/03/university-of-sydneys-edward-holmes-wins-pms-science-prize-for-work-on-coronavirus-genome", "last_update": "2021-11-03T06:20:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Tottenham union suits Conte and Levy after summer blame game | David Hytner", "article": "Confront previous inconvenience and own the narrative. It is a staple PR play. And how Tottenham pushed it on Tuesday as they trumpeted the arrival of Antonio Conte as their new head coach. The inconvenience lay in how Conte had turned them down on 4 June. At that point Spurs were 46 days into the search for a permanent successor to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and, as we know, it would take 72 before they plumped for Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo \u2013 who had been out of work for the previous 37.\nNuno always felt like an uneasy fit, an appointment that failed to quicken the pulses of the supporters and he departed on Monday having virtually stopped them. On 2 June, the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, had opened talks with Conte, who had left Internazionale seven days earlier. Very quickly, there was a confidence on the Spurs side that a deal could be struck \u2013 but then, within 48 hours, it was all off. There was a blame game, with Tottenham letting it be known they were concerned about Conte\u2019s demands for a budget to reshape the squad \u2013 and one that did not factor in the sale of Harry Kane which, in fairness, Levy was not considering, either. The club also indicated they were worried as to whether Conte would commit to blooding young players, giving opportunities to players such as Oliver Skipp and Ryan Sessegnon. Nuno started Skipp in eight of his 10 Premier League games. Sessegnon has mainly been injured this season. How did Conte feel about the framing of events? He was not happy, to put it bluntly, even if there was an acknowledgment on his side of Spurs\u2019 need to project a version that defended them. Conte knows as well as anybody how cynical this business can be. Which is why it was difficult not to smile when Conte was quoted on Spurs\u2019 official channels explaining his decision to come this time. \u201cLast summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season \u2013 so I felt that it wasn\u2019t yet the right time to return to coaching. \u201cBut the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.\u201d\nIt is easy to wonder what has changed for Conte, assuming he still believes the Spurs squad needs surgery and it would not be performed cheaply. Emerson Royal, Cristian Romero and Bryan Gil were signed in July and August \u2013 representing steps in the right direction \u2013 but, on the down side, the group still looks thin in areas and the January transfer window is a distance away. It is never ideal for a manager to take over mid\u2011season, which is why Conte has not done so since 2007\u201108, with Bari, and this Spurs team are at a horribly low ebb, with five defeats in the league already. The more pertinent question concerns what has changed for Levy and the answer lies in the toxicity of the mood around Tottenham\u2019s stadium on Saturday during and after the 3-0 defeat against Manchester United. It has been a catalogue of disaster for Levy since December, taking in the slump under Mourinho, which led to his sacking six days before the Carabao Cup final; the rush to join the doomed European Super League; the exit strategy of Kane (albeit one that was thwarted); and the botched hire of Nuno. Levy has never had a tougher time in terms of his relationship with the fans and as he plotted his move after the United debacle he knew he needed something big. Something like, say, appointing the best out-of-work manager in the European game. He came to feel this was the only move to appease the masses and, with it, there have been concessions, the kind Levy has been reluctant to make in the past, to do with control over transfer business. Pressed into a corner, Levy has had to make certain promises to Conte.\nIt is traditional at times such as these to talk about war chests but what Levy has said to Conte is that he will always back him for the right player. Which sounds promising or a little too open to interpretation, depending on your view. As ever, sales will be vital and much will hinge on the work of Fabio Paratici, whom Spurs announced on 12 June as their managing director of football, with effect from 1 July. Conte worked productively with Paratici at Juventus from 2011 to 2014, winning the Serie A title every season, and it is safe to assume the pair spoke in early June when Levy first moved for Conte. It was widely reported at the time that Paratici had given his word to Levy that Conte would join Spurs but perhaps he did not have the working knowledge of the club back then; the capacity to be able to reassure Conte. That has changed. Levy has spoken about how Spurs have been hit hard by the pandemic but as he has taken out loans to plug financial gaps \u2013 including those linked to the construction of the \u00a31.2bn ground \u2013 the broader picture offers encouragement. According to Deloitte, the club\u2019s most recent accounts show \u201cmatchday and commercial revenue grew to \u00a394.5m (up 16%) and \u00a3160.5m (up 20%) respectively, demonstrating the revenue-generating potential that they have unlocked through the new stadium\u201d. Full capacity crowds have made projections within the league\u2019s profit and sustainability rules even better.\nWith Levy, there has long been the sense that each managerial hire is a reaction to the previous departure, making it hard to discern a consistent blueprint or, to use the buzz phrase, a club DNA. He has bounced from Glenn Hoddle to David Pleat to Jacques Santini; from Juande Ramos to Harry Redknapp to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas; from Mauricio Pochettino to Mourinho. What Conte promises to bring, however, chimes with what Levy and every Spurs fan wants: quick, hard-running football; intelligent, well\u2011drilled patterns; the remorseless will to win. It would surely have been preferable for Levy to have secured Conte in June. The pair intend to retrieve the lost time.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/03/tottenham-union-suits-conte-and-levy-after-summer-blame-game", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:55:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Detroit Lions face an impressively unenviable NFL record: a 0-17 season", "article": "Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker III brought up the most unpleasant NFL numbers possible after a nasty 44-6 loss on Sunday: \u201cWe have to fix it now, because obviously, it ain\u2019t going to fix itself, or we\u2019ll be 0-17,\u201d he said after the defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles. And there it was, for all the world to ponder: 0-17. No NFL team has gone 0-17, in large part because no NFL team has played 17 games in a regular season since 1930, when the late Frankford Yellow Jackets finished 4-13-1, and the New York Football Giants finished 13-4. But the NFL, always sniffing more money, expanded the regular season to 17 games from 16 this year, and the 0-8 Lions, who may not be the worst NFL team but are now the only winless NFL team, are getting close enough that 0-17 is coming up in conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them think like that,\u201d Dan Campbell, their first-year coach, said Monday.\nWhen Campbell, the fiery former tight end and long-time NFL assistant who led the Miami Dolphins to five victories in 12 games as interim coach in 2015, took the Lions\u2019 job in January, he drew some attention (and gasps) by promising, \u201cWhen you knock us down, we\u2019re going to get up, and on the way up, we\u2019re going to bite a kneecap off.\u201d The Lions have done little actual damage since, though they lost to Baltimore and Minnesota by two points each. The loss to the Ravens was particularly cruel because Justin Tucker beat Detroit with a NFL-record 66-yard field goal as time expired (the Vikings game wasn\u2019t much better: the Lions lost that one on a last-second Greg Joseph kick).\nBut at least the Lions put themselves in a position to win those games. The loss to the Eagles, who had been sputtering going into the game, was so thorough and demoralizing that 0-17 came up, evoking unpleasant memories. Only two NFL teams went 0-16 in 43 years: the Cleveland Browns in 2017, and, yep, the Detroit Lions in 2008. \u201cFor us to win, we\u2019ve got to play damn near perfect,\u201d said Campbell, the former Texas Aggie, \u201cand that\u2019s on us. We\u2019re charged with that as coaches.\u201d Lions quarterback Jared Goff, the former No 1 overall draft pick who helped the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl just three years ago before a drop in production, said, grimly, \u201cUntil we change our habits and until we change who we are, nothing will change.\u201d Any run to an 0-for-the-season attracts rubberneckers, but the Lions are especially compelling because (a) it\u2019s not too long since their last winless season, and (b) they are a big-market team that has been owned by the Ford family, the automakers, for nearly 60 years. They have won exactly one playoff game in that timespan. Indeed, the Lions\u2019 Wikipedia history page has been edited to include the following: \u201cIn the current millennia (sic), the Detroit Lions record of franchise mediocrity has been solidified through the continuing incompetent ownership of the Ford family.\u201d This has been a superb college football season in the state, with Michigan State rallying to beat Michigan on Saturday in a battle of unbeaten top-10 rivals. Even with the Lions facing an opponent some people thought they could beat, the paid attendance at Ford Field a day later 85 miles away was 47,192, nearly 18,000 short of capacity. \u201cWinning solves a lot of issues, as you all know,\u201d Campbell said. But the Lions have not won much for decades. They have lost all eight of their playoff games since 1991, when they fell apart in the second half against Washington in the NFC championship game. That was as close as the Lions have come to the Super Bowl. In fact, the Lions are one of just four NFL teams that have never played in a Super Bowl. And Jacksonville, Cleveland and Houston \u2013 the three others \u2013 have been around far less time than the Lions, who were established in 1928 as the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans. The Lions won the 1935 NFL championship and three more in their glory days between 1952 and 1957, but those were football\u2019s dark ages. Consider that a person born on 29 December 1957, the date when Detroit won their most recent NFL title, will turn 64 next month. Campbell is the 21st Lions\u2019 head coach since that day. He arrived with lower expectations than his immediate non-interim predecessor, Matt Patricia, a Bill Belichick disciple whose Lions won 13 of 43 games. Patricia hightailed it back to New England. The Lions are young, and Campbell has kept his expectations in check. Still, as he said during a news conference Monday: \u201cLook. We\u2019re in the middle of a lot of adversity now. We knew it was going to come. But I don\u2019t think any of us thought it was going to be 0-8.\u201d They won\u2019t lose this weekend, because they have a bye, and Campbell is planning to use the time to do a little more \u201cself-scouting,\u201d as coaches like to call it, to look at more tape and identify the problems. A lack of effort apparently is not one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of focus, details, fundamentals \u2013 and sometimes, a lack of attitude, if you will,\u201d Campbell said, referring to his team\u2019s tendency to take a while to reach a full boil. A Detroit Tigers\u2019 cap pulled low on his head, Campbell was blunt but calm. When he was told what Walker had said about possibly going 0-17, Campbell pointed out that the Lions still have nine games left, including a Thanksgiving Day home game against the struggling Chicago Bears. The New York Jets lost their first 13 games last year to stoke a lot of 0-16 chatter until, to the dismay of their fans, they won two games in a row to surpass Jacksonville, who won their opener and then lost their last 15 games. The Jaguars used the No 1 pick on Trevor Lawrence. The Lions already have a No 1 pick at quarterback, plus three draft picks acquired in the trade that sent their talented quarterback Matt Stafford to the Rams, who are 7-1. A turnaround may take a while, maybe even into 2022, but Campbell said one is coming. \u201cI know we\u2019re not the team that played yesterday,\u201d he said Monday, even though the Lions were that very team.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/03/detroit-lions-winless-season-0-17-nfl-football", "last_update": "2021-11-03T05:28:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Lawyers admit Australian government\u2019s conduct in fracking court case \u2018regrettable\u2019", "article": "Lawyers for the resources minister have conceded the Morrison government\u2019s \u201cregrettable\u201d conduct in a federal court case denied environmentalists the opportunity to prevent the Coalition from signing contracts to pay Empire Energy $21m to frack the Beetaloo Basin. The federal court is currently hearing a case lodged by the Environment Centre NT challenging a grants program designed to accelerate fracking in the Northern Territory as part of the government\u2019s gas-led recovery. The $50m program has already awarded almost half its funds to a single company, Empire, which is seeking to drill three exploratory wells in the basin. The central allegation in the case is that the grants were not lawful because the resources minister, Keith Pitt, failed to properly consider the risk to global heating posed by opening up the region to fracking. Earlier this year, as lawyers on both sides prepared for the current hearing, government solicitors wrote to the Environment Centre NT and promised it had no imminent plans to sign contracts with Empire. But, without any notice, it did precisely that in September.\nThe court heard the government\u2019s actions effectively denied the opportunity for the Environment Centre NT and others to seek an order from the court to prevent the signing of such agreements until the case was resolved. The government\u2019s actions sparked a furious response from the federal court, where justice John Griffiths said they were \u201cunfortunate and not reflecting well on the minister\u201d. The issue reared its head again on Wednesday. The Environment Centre NT and other applicants now allege the government signed the contracts in \u201corder to stymy the applicants\u2019 claim in this litigation\u201d. They argue the government wanted to lock the contracts in before the court had the opportunity to determine whether the grants and the grant scheme were lawful. Tom Howe QC, representing the minister, agreed the government had failed in its duty to act as a model litigant. Howe agreed the government\u2019s actions had denied those mounting the challenge the opportunity to seek interlocutory relief to prevent the contracts from being signed until the case was finalised. \u201cWhat happened should not have happened. What the commonwealth should have done when the opportunity to enter the contracts was brought forward was to write to the applicant and give them notice, reasonable notice of that so that they could make an application for interlocutory relief,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should have happened and it didn\u2019t and that was quite regrettable conduct that involved a departure from model litigant standards.\u201d But Howe denied, in strong terms, that the government had signed the contracts with the intention of thwarting the case or the applicants. \u201cYour honour knows that very often, when conspiracy or malice is alleged, that it can often be truly explained on the basis of error,\u201d Howe said. \u201cSometimes error of a serious kind, but not of a kind that involves intended wrongdoing.\u201d Howe also criticised the fact that the allegation had only been levelled at the government late on Friday. \u201cIt is a most serious allegation to raise. It\u2019s a serious allegation to raise very late in the day, for the first time after the close of evidence and only in submissions in reply.\u201d But the judge said the commonwealth was guilty of the same failing, having only notified the applicants of a key part of its argument and relevant case law on Sunday. The hearing concluded on Wednesday.

{"title": "Doctor who presided over cluster of infant deaths at Bacchus Marsh hospital banned from practising", "article": "A doctor who was director of obstetrics and gynaecology at a Victorian hospital during a cluster of baby deaths has been effectively banned from practising medicine again. However, the disciplinary action has come years after he already retired. Dr Surinder Parhar has not practised medicine since October 2015, after an investigation into a tragic cluster of newborn and stillborn deaths at the Bacchus Marsh hospital. He worked at the hospital for 30 years. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal made nine findings of professional misconduct against Parhar, banning him from practising for another 12 years. While it was not alleged Parhar directly caused any of the deaths, the tribunal found in its decision published on Wednesday that he \u201cfailed to recognise that what was happening needed to be addressed, and that he had individual responsibility to do something\u201d.\nThe case concerned Parhar\u2019s actions related to 27 maternity patients at the hospital between 2008 and 2015. Twenty-one of those patients experienced stillbirth or death of their baby shortly after birth, while others experienced various adverse events, a rate much higher than what would be expected for a hospital of the size of Bacchus Marsh. \u201cAs a low-risk birthing facility, the number of adverse outcomes over a short period of time should have led to \u2018alarm bells ringing\u2019 but did not,\u201d the tribunal found. \u201cLittle action was taken to identify the causes of the adverse outcomes or implement changes in practice. The failures in practice were not identified and continued for a significant period of time putting more patients at risk.\u201d The tribunal found deficiencies in Parhar\u2019s direct clinical care of one patient after he failed to recognise her symptoms were the result of the death of her baby. He also failed to ensure there were adequate clinical reviews of 19 perinatal deaths; to ensure there was adequate open disclosure with patients in relation to 15 perinatal deaths; to ensure necessary policies were in place to improve patient safety; to provide adequate supervision of three junior doctors; to improve or maintain his own professional performance; or to keep proper records. Parhar admitted to all of the allegations. \u201cHe is highly remorseful \u2013 he is sorry for himself and his role in this \u2018sad story\u2019 but also sorry for the impact on the parents and the community,\u201d the decision said. \u201cHe recognises that his career has ended in shame and ignominy. Much of what has been identified is very much \u2018with the benefit of hindsight\u2019.\u201d The tribunal decision said Parhar was not the only staff member to fail patients, noting \u201can almost systemic complacency and misguided self-congratulation about the quality of the maternity service\u201d.\nOther cases involving former hospital staff at the time are due to come before the tribunal. But the tribunal found there had been \u201cyears of missed opportunities to recognise and acknowledge what was going wrong, and act to prevent future avoidable deaths and adverse patient outcomes\u201d. \u201cParhar was not the only senior health practitioner \u2026 to be blind to the pattern emerging and to fail to recognise that alarm bells should have been ringing,\u201d the decision said. \u201cNevertheless, he occupied a significant leadership role as the director of obstetrics, although he did not apparently recognise that; and he had undoubted responsibilities as a medical practitioner and senior obstetrician, which he did not properly discharge.\u201d The tribunal acknowledged that its decision to ban Parhar from practising medicine for 12 years would have little practical impact on his career given he was already retired. \u201cBut it sends a clear message to those who may still expect to have years of medical practice before them that, if they engage in similar conduct, their time as a doctor is likely to end well before their planned retirement,\u201d the decision said. In 2015, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) apologised for the length of the investigation into the health service, after first receiving a complaint in 2013 about the care a different doctor provided to a mother after a stillbirth. Ahpra has investigated 43 health practitioners who then worked at Bacchus Marsh hospital. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nOn Wednesday Ahpra chief executive, Martin Fletcher, said this tribunal decision was a strong outcome in response to \u201ctragic and sad events\u201d. \u201cIt is important to hold accountable practitioners in leadership roles who have clear responsibilities for patient safety and who fail to act,\u201d he said. The case against Parhar was brought by the Medical Board of Australia. The board\u2019s chair, Dr Anne Tonkin, described the failures of the hospital as \u201ctragic\u201d. \u201cWhile we recognise this decision may be of little comfort for the families who so sadly lost their babies, it highlights the importance of registered medical practitioners, especially those in senior positions, understanding and acting on their responsibilities to ensure safe patient care,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/doctor-who-presided-over-cluster-of-infant-deaths-at-bacchus-marsh-hospital-banned-from-practising", "last_update": "2021-11-03T06:25:43Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Peaces by Helen Oyeyemi review \u2013 a hurtling hothouse of a novel", "article": "Helen Oyeyemi is a bamboozler, a discombobulator, a peddler of perplexity. She crushes fables and fairytales down to a powder and then laces her fiction with it like some kind of literary hallucinogen. Her novels should come with pharmaceutical warning labels: do not operate heavy machinery under the influence. Symptoms may include slurred realism and a persistent allegorical itch. In her most recent books, the British author seems to have been experimenting with how much expository and explanatory weight she can jettison to make space for filigree and romp. In 2019\u2019s Gingerbread, the result was something akin to immersive theatre \u2013 an invitation to explore. What we lost in orientation, we gained in play space. Gingerbread could be read as a novel about Brexit insularity, the tenacious forces of social immobility, or just a high fantasia about stupendous biscuitry. Oyeyemi\u2019s seventh novel, Peaces, is set on a train, a chimerical engine so scaled and silvered it seems almost creaturely. Inside its carriages, the laws of physics don\u2019t quite apply; the air crackles with ontological doubt (\u201cIf you stuck out your tongue it would dance there, right at the tip: the fizz of conditionality\u201d). Trains provide a \u201csticky mix of enclosure and exposure\u201d, Oyeyemi writes; an \u201cincubator for intense encounters\u201d. This one \u2013 The Lucky Day \u2013 comes replete with a postal sorting office, portrait gallery, sauna and holding cell. Not to mention a glass-panelled greenhouse car. And that\u2019s what Oyeyemi has built here: a hurtling hothouse of a novel. In the wilds of \u201cdeepest Kent\u201d we join Otto and Xavier Shin \u2013 a mesmerist and his ghostwriter lover \u2013 as they embark on their \u201cnon-honeymoon honeymoon\u201d. The trip is a gift from a wealthy insomniac aunt (\u201cshe looks so tired nobody realises she\u2019s rich\u201d), and they are accompanied \u2013 as always \u2013 by \u00c1rp\u00e1d, Otto\u2019s companion mongoose, 30th in a distinguished line of companion mongooses stretching back two centuries (mongooses should travel before they hit middle age, Oyeyemi explains, \u201cotherwise they get narrow-minded\u201d). Otto and Xavier share The Lucky Day with three others: a composer-cum-driver, a debt control officer (mystical trains are expensive), and the train\u2019s owner, theremin virtuoso Ava Kapoor, who \u2013 rumour has it \u2013 never disembarks. Is she a recluse or a captive? When our lovers catch a glimpse of her through a window, they can\u2019t tell if the sign she\u2019s holding says \u201cHELLO\u201d or \u201cHELP\u201d. It\u2019s all so drenched in quirk and whimsy \u2013 the leashed mongoose, the theremin, the brocade fainting couch in the train library that is \u201cthe colour of Darjeeling tea in the fourth minute of brewing\u201d \u2013 the stuff of Wes Anderson fever dreams. But, unlike Anderson\u2019s The Darjeeling Limited, the legacy of empire is wild and wakeful on Oyeyemi\u2019s train, not just elaborate wallpaper. The Lucky Day was once a tea smuggling train, with shady connections to the East India company. With old money come old cruelties. \u201cI\u2019m sure almost no one deludes themselves that all their ancestors were decent,\u201d Otto reminds us. As The Lucky Day lurches through a landscape our lovers don\u2019t recognise, Peaces lurches in and out of time and memory, accumulating symbols and backstories like clues to a grand whodunnit. What do a burning house, days-of-the-week boxer shorts, a board game duel, a handful of emeralds, a contested inheritance and a man in a peacock-green scuba suit have in common? Why is it that each of the passengers sees a different image emerge from the white-on-white paintings in the gallery car? Just as we suspect Oyeyemi has lost control \u2013 as her locomotive careens into Dadaist chaos \u2013 Ava arrives brandishing an envelope bearing the officious little stamp of the \u201cAgency for Introducing a Sense of Proportion into Novel Writing\u201d. Whether that missive delights or maddens will depend entirely on the reader. By the time Oyeyemi\u2019s wilfully disproportionate train has stopped, a unifying character has appeared in silhouette: the artist who painted those shapeshifting canvases. As his connection to our cast is drawn out, so is a parable of connection, of the ways we shapeshift to fulfil each other\u2019s desires. Peaces turns the existential terror of feeling unseen into a corporeal reality. How easy it is to lose yourself \u2013 or erase someone else \u2013 with the heat of your own wanting. To live unseen is a tragedy, but Peaces continues Oyeyemi\u2019s career-long project of helping us to unsee \u2013 unsnarling the neural knots that childhood fairytales tied in us: those tales of sovereignty and dominion, of limp princesses and their flaxen-haired suitors, of snowy purity and moral absolutes. White-on-white. \u201cHere\u2019s to unseeing the world,\u201d Ava rejoices. What we lose in orientation in this novel, we gain in a kind of merciless velocity. It\u2019s hard not to feel like a passenger aboard this book, a little queasy from watching the narrative blur and judder. But for all of her twee excesses, there are few writers who can match Oyeyemi\u2019s creative glee. On a first read, Peaces works best when you stop trying to solve it, and instead surrender to that exuberance. Far better to sit back and revel in this book\u2019s queer sensualities and the sherbet fizz of its wit; to enjoy the company of platinum-furred, jewel-hoarder \u00c1rp\u00e1d, lithe as Nijinsky reincarnate; or perhaps try to imagine a melody that makes a \u201ctheremin sound as if it was looking back on a long life of crime\u201d. Then when it\u2019s over, return \u2013 clear-eyed \u2013 for a second trip. \u2022 Peaces by Helen Oyeyemi is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

Gennadiy Shukin, Taymyr, Russia I was born in 1962 in a family of deer herders in Taymyr, on a peninsula in the very far north of Russia. I am part of the Dolgan community: we are an indigenous Russian group and there are around 6,000 left of us living in the tundra. Growing up, the Soviet Union tried to deny us our traditional way of life, but since then climate change has become the biggest challenge to our survival. Our community lives by hunting, fishing and herding deer. Scientists say that Taymyr has the most rapid temperature increase in Russia, and we can really feel it. Because of the warmer winters, we have seen that deer are giving birth earlier in the year. Many are born too weak and don\u2019t survive the long journeys they have to make. This means there is much less deer for us to hunt and it hurts the whole ecosystem. Rivers and lakes that we use for fishing have also started to dry out. Others are too polluted after all the big oil and gas plants have sprung up over the years in our lands. Some days we don\u2019t catch any fish at all. For generations, we have sold the food we caught to local towns and cities to buy basic products like sugar and wheat. Without animals, we cannot survive. Big craters are also forming because the Arctic permafrost is starting to melt under our feet. This means the routes that we have used for decades to travel, hunt and fish have to be adjusted as whole roads have sunk. It is also dangerous as you never know where the next crater will form. Our ecosystem is changing quickly: animals such as sables that I have never seen before in my life have appeared in the tundra. And now we also have to deal with giant mosquitoes and bugs that attack our livestock. The summers are becoming unbearable. It\u2019s madness. The youth sees that climate change makes our traditional way of life impossible and they are forced to move to the bigger cities to find jobs, which are often low-paid.

Gabie, a visual artist living in Gloucestershire, said they hoped to promote a shift in thinking about the climate crisis to focus on humanity\u2019s integration with and dependency on the natural world. \u201cThe conversations in Cop26 are dominated by a western notion of how we address climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to say part of the solution is a change of thinking, which can be inspired by other communities who have lived with nature in a very different way to our own. \u201cIt\u2019s opening ourselves to those different voices, that different conversation, and a different dialogue with nature and the environment that I think is so vital and necessary.\u201d\nBayley, a research manager, said indigenous and minority languages were rooted in their bonds with the surrounding environment. \u201cLanguage grows out of a place so the specifics of that place \u2013 the creatures, the plants, the landscape, the climate \u2013 are all represented in the language,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also language describes more deeply the relationships of humans to the more than human, but also all those other relationships to each other.\u201d Bayley cites the word tshinanu, from the Innu language Nehluen spoken in the Quebec province of Canada that means an all-inclusive \u201cwe \u2013 all as equals\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re very much driving the [Cop26] negotiations from a point of fear, \u2018If we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019re all screwed\u2019. As if we need to feel the heat turning up, the pressure increasing, in order for us to take action,\u201d she said. \u201cOur project is aiming to say it\u2019s all about relationships. From a sense we belong in nature, and that it\u2019s not a battle between either we win with our development model, or nature wins and we have to give up all that stuff. We\u2019re on the same side: we\u2019re in relationship with each other. The earth wants us to be here, because we also support her: there\u2019s a mutuality about it.\u201d Five words from the Living Language Land collection Itrofillmongen From the Mapudungun language of Chile, this means the indivisible elements of the diversity of life, both tangible and unseen.\nAibidil This Scottish Gaelic word was chosen to represent the 18 letters of the Gaelic alphabet, which has its roots in the tree-like script of Ogham.\n|Xau A verb from the bushman\u2019s language of |Xam from Namibia, |xau means \u201cto shoot with a magical arrow or go on a magical expedition\u201d.\nNapuro This word from the Cuyo islands of the Philippines means a forest within a forest, signifying an island of ancient trees, surrounded by younger forest.\nW\u00edyuk\u010da\u014b This Lakota word, chosen by Tiokasin Ghosthorse, means consciousness or knowing.

{"title": "Left more than \u00a32,000 out of pocket after passport confusion", "article": "We booked a last-minute holiday to Malta in August and checked post-Brexit entry requirements on the government website. It stated that passports need to be valid for at least three months after the day you planned to leave Malta, or any other Schengen country. I had five and a half months left on mine. However, when I tried to check in for our Ryanair flight, the airline told me travellers must have at least six months left on their passports in order to fly, and that we would be denied boarding. We therefore lost the \u00a31,200 we\u2019d paid for the holiday, and spent another \u00a31,600 on an alternative week in Cornwall. I can\u2019t be the only person caught out by this confusion about the rules. MF, Ipswich, Suffolk Indeed, you are not, and the fault lies, in part, with the Home Office. For nine months it published misleading information about post-Brexit passport requirements to Schengen countries. The guidance on the HM Passport Office website, published in October last year, stated that at least six months must be left on a passport for travel to most European countries. At the end of July, the government amended the guidance after reports of holidaymakers who had been denied boarding by airlines because of the error. The website now confirms the three-month rule and merely recommends that passports have six months of validity. Since you were due to fly in mid-August, Ryanair should have been aware of the rules and of the government correction. It had no business refusing to fly you. Not that the airline is admitting any fault. \u201cRyanair complies with all European Commission travel regulations and passengers travelling between the EU and the UK after the end of the transition period must have a passport that is not valid for more than 10 years,\u201d it says, completely missing the point. EU requirements do state that passports cannot be valid for more than 10 years (some older UK ones are) but since your passport reaches its 10th anniversary next February that is irrelevant. I pointed this out to Ryanair, but was met with resounding silence. The Home Office also focuses on the irrelevant 10-year rule to save face. Not only does it decline to apologise for misleading travellers, it claims its erroneous advice was doing travellers a favour. \u201cTo avoid the possibility of citizens encountering difficulties at any particular border when complying with these rules, our advice continues to show that any extra months added to a 10-year passport may not count. We make no apology for taking a risk-averse approach to ensure our citizens do not face issues at borders.\u201d When I again asked why, if the government stood by its guidance, it had been quietly rewritten in July, there was no further response. The good news is that, according to the specialist aviation solicitor Bott & Co, you can try to claim compensation from Ryanair and argue you were denied boarding without reasonable grounds under EC 261/2004 which has, since Brexit, been enshrined in UK law. The bad news is, the sum payable is limited to \u00a3350 and that still leaves you more than \u00a32,000 out of pocket. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

{"title": "\u2018An unbelievable sense of freedom\u2019: why Americans are quitting in record numbers", "article": "Josie, 19, landed her first \u201cadult\u201d job as an IT support worker last November, just a few months after graduating from high school. Though the job could be done fully remotely, managers insisted that she come into the office \u2013 despite the pandemic. At first, her co-workers and managers wore masks, but often incorrectly; when the local mask mandate was lifted, people stopped wearing them altogether. \u201cIt was honestly scary,\u201d Josie recalls. She\u2019d just moved into her first apartment with her partner; both have pre-existing health conditions that increase their vulnerability to severe illness from Covid-19. But as the sole earner in her two-person household, Josie felt resigned to the daily risk at work.\n\u201cIt was like getting shot out of a cannon into adulthood,\u201d she says. This August amid the rise of the Delta variant, she finally quit \u2013 becoming one of the 4.3 million American workers to voluntarily leave their jobs during that month alone. It was a record-breaking month for resignations since the government began tracking monthly job turnovers more than two decades ago, according to labor department data released in mid-October. Between January and August of this year, at least 30 million Americans quit their jobs. Whether you call it the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d or a \u201cnationwide reassessment of work\u201d, the labor market shake-up of the pandemic could have unexpected aftershocks for years to come. That may be especially true for early-career workers like Josie, who have now spent a major chunk of their working lives under the strain of Covid-19. Many of these workers say their job experiences in the pandemic have led them to recognize their real priorities in life \u2013 and leaving a job is perhaps the boldest assertion of those priorities they can make. \u2018It gave me this unbelievable sense of freedom\u2019 \u201cI never imagined it would happen this way, but here I am,\u201d says Alex, a 27-year-old marketing professional who had worked at the same Boston-based consumer tech startup since she graduated from college until early October, when she resigned from the company via email. Pre-pandemic, the company\u2019s culture was relaxed. But the switch to fully remote work in March 2020 was swiftly followed by a sharp boom in product sales. Over time, an \u201calways on\u201d work culture crept in as a result, with co-workers communicating at all hours. When a colleague left the company, Alex\u2019s workload doubled with no additional pay. \u201cI just felt like I couldn\u2019t let things go, because [the company was] really small,\u201d she says. \u201cIf anyone were to leave, it just seemed impossible.\u201d Alex reached out to teammates for help, only to discover that they were just as burned out as she was. But because this was the only job she\u2019d ever had, she didn\u2019t initially recognize that the extent of her overwork \u2013 and her sense of personal obligation to the business \u2013 were not necessarily normal or healthy. That is, until she talked to others outside the company. Quitting has been more than a relief. \u201cIt gave me this unbelievable sense of freedom that I could do whatever I wanted, and made things so much clearer,\u201d says Alex, speaking from her parents\u2019 home near Washington. She plans to spend a few months relaxing with family before finding a new job, possibly in non-profit work. She has also begun revisiting long-deferred plans to pursue a graduate degree in public administration \u2013 plans that were easy to neglect in the face of an ever-mounting workload. Like Alex, 28-year-old Cassie also experienced a pandemic burnout in her role as a case manager for a life insurance company in central Pennsylvania. A visual artist by training, Cassie joined the firm in July 2019 after a stint doing freelance graphic design work. It wasn\u2019t her dream job, but the stability was a nice change at first. Then in the second half of 2020, her workload multiplied seemingly overnight. Before long, Cassie was fielding more work calls than any single person could handle. Work became so all-consuming that she converted her home studio space, originally set up for unwinding and making art, into a makeshift home office. \u201c[The pandemic] turned this space for good times into work times, and eventually bad times,\u201d Cassie recalls. While she remains grateful to have had the ability to work from home in 2020, losing the time and space for a creative outlet was a blow. A few weeks ago, she opted to leave the job for good. Thanks to a salaried live-in partner and some personal savings, she feels fortunate to have a \u201ccoasting budget\u201d to live from while she explores what comes next. She hopes to find a job that\u2019s both creative and stable. \u2018My life is my life and my job is my job\u2019 For 27-year-old Lloren Zeigler, quitting was a way to regain control of her time. Leaving her job as a television production manager, last December, was easy. \u201cThey wanted me to work through the holiday and I said abso-fucking-lutely not,\u201d says Zeigler. Since walking away from her entertainment industry role nearly a year ago, the Los Angeles-based Zeigler has devoted herself full-time to the small business she began in 2020 with her partner, Liz Sanchez. The pair make incense that they sell at local swap meets and flea markets under the brand Le Trois Apothecary. It may or may not become a forever-job, but Zeigler appreciates the opportunity to nurture her entrepreneurial streak. Nancy, 30, a PR professional who also lives in Los Angeles, similarly resigned from her job for the greener pastures of self-employment. Working remotely during quarantine, she realized that she didn\u2019t need to rely on a hovering boss to be productive and do work that she could feel good about. In October, she left her position at a small recording company after just three months \u2013 her second time quitting a job during the pandemic. \u201cMy job is not my life,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cMy life is my life and my job is my job. I\u2019m willing to take on the uncertainty [of unemployment] simply to have my own time under control, and have my own life available to me.\u201d While Nancy remains open to the possibility of another full-time role, she says that a prospective employer would need to respect her boundaries and trust her to manage her own schedule. For the time being, she plans to pursue freelance music marketing projects and related project management. Josie, the 19-year-old in Ohio, is similarly protective of her personal boundaries in a work setting. Since quitting, she\u2019s found a new job doing similar work for a different company. This time, however, the position is fully remote. Though she isn\u2019t sure where her future will lead, Josie says she now knows what her rights are as a worker. They include the right to leave a job without remorse. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t care about me, either,\u201d she says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/an-unbelievable-sense-of-freedom-why-americans-are-quitting-in-record-numbers", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:20:17Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party saved Labour seats in 2019 election, analysis finds", "article": "Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party may have saved up to 25 Labour seats in the Midlands and the north at the 2019 general election, denying Boris Johnson a landslide majority of 130, according to new analysis. Farage\u2019s party failed to win a single seat in December 2019 as Boris Johnson sought to hammer home the message that the Conservatives would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. But elections experts John Curtice, Stephen Fisher and Patrick English say that by attracting Leave-supporting former Labour voters who might otherwise have backed the Conservatives, Farage may have significantly cut the scale of Labour\u2019s defeat. By modelling the behaviour of Labour Leavers elsewhere, they suggest that in the absence of a Brexit party candidate, 70% would likely have turned to the Tories and 30% stuck with Labour. Meanwhile, Conservative voters who switched to Farage\u2019s party were likely to have voted for Johnson. \u201cAs a result, the Brexit party may have cost the Conservatives about 25 of the seats that Labour managed to retain \u2013 most of them Leave-voting seats in the north of England and the Midlands \u2013 and thereby enabled Labour to avoid an even heavier loss of seats,\u201d they say in a new book, The British General Election of 2019, published on Tuesday. Labour\u2019s performance was already its worst in terms of seats won since 1935, prompting Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation after a chaotic campaign. The Brexit party stood its most prominent candidate, Richard Tice, in Labour-held Hartlepool where he took more than 10,000 votes but came in behind Labour and the Conservatives. The seat fell to the Tories in a byelection this year, raising questions about Keir Starmer\u2019s ability to win back the so-called red wall. Farage repeatedly sought an electoral pact with Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in 2019, offering to stand aside in Tory-held seats in exchange for a free run in former Labour heartlands constituencies. With no deal forthcoming, he unilaterally decided not to field candidates in seats where there was an incumbent Tory MP. This move had less of an effect on the UK-wide result, the authors say \u2013 but it did have an impact in a few key seats that the Tories only narrowly held. \u201cThere was just a handful of seats where the decision of the Brexit party to stand down might have helped avoid a Conservative defeat, though they include the seats of two prominent Brexiters, Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford & Wood Green) and Dominic Raab (Esher & Walton).\u201d The Liberal Democrats are heavily targeting Raab\u2019s Surrey constituency, which he held by just 2,700 votes. Edited by academics Tim Bale, Robert Ford, Will Jennings and Paula Surridge, the new book is the latest edition of what is widely viewed as the definitive academic guide to general elections, with the first edition published in the wake of Labour\u2019s landslide victory in 1945. By analysing constituency-by-constituency results, and responses to the British Election Study internet panel, covering 30,000 voters, Curtice, Fisher and English show that Brexit heavily skewed the outcome in contests right across the country. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 share of the vote increased by nearly six [percentage] points on 2017 in seats that are estimated to have backed Leave most heavily in 2016, while the party\u2019s vote fell by a couple of points in constituencies where most had voted Remain,\u201d they say. By contrast, they add: \u201cWhile Labour\u2019s vote fell by six points where most voters had backed Remain, it dropped by nearly nine points where a majority had supported Leave.\u201d They say this pattern was \u201cdisruptive of much of the existing geography of party support\u201d so that \u201call of Britain\u2019s parties often recorded some of their best performances in relatively unfamiliar territory\u201d \u2013 including the Conservatives\u2019 advances in the North and Midlands.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/03/nigel-farages-brexit-party-saved-labour-seats-in-2019-election-analysis-finds", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:28:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018We run from men only to meet crocodiles\u2019: Kenya\u2019s drought is deadly for women", "article": "The setting sun brings a warm glow to the huts in the village of Umoja in Samburu county, Kenya. Christine Sitiyan sits outside her home with her beadwork, carefully running the thin thread through tiny bead holes, hoping she can finish the colourful belt she is making before darkness sets in. The traditional belt can fetch 3,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a320), enough to cover her needs for a month. This tranquil scene is very different from her troubled past. Like many girls in her community, Sitiyan never finished school but was married off as a young teenager. Seven years later, with two children, she left her husband, unable to endure the beatings from a man she says could no longer fend for the family in an increasingly harsh environment. \u201cHe would beat me almost every evening out of frustration,\u201d says Sitiyan, 25. \u201cThe drought killed part of his family\u2019s livestock, while raiders from a neighbouring community stole the rest.\u201d He took up manual labour, earning 300 shillings a day, barely enough to provide for the family. \u201cOne day, I just took off with the children and found refuge here.\u201d Sitiyan is among scores of women and girls in Umoja, a village that has become a rescue centre for women and girls escaping domestic violence, female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages. There are no men in this manyatta, the traditional homestead.\nWhile the women may have escaped these threats, they are still potential victims of \u201cdrought-instigated violence\u201d. Along with women in other marginalised counties such as Garissa, Marsabit, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir and Turkana, they are at great risk of sexual molestation as they trek long distances in search of water. John Kitui, country director of Oxfam Kenya, an organisation that works with local groups helping to build resilience, says: \u201cAs the drought continues, families have nothing to fall back on and are forced to marry off daughters early to receive dowry payment. Without school fees, it is often girls who are forced out of class who then bear children at a young age. The resulting stress often leads to domestic violence.\u201d Women are also the unintended victims of tribal conflicts as communities fight over dwindling resources. Men are forced to move remaining livestock tens of kilometres away to find foliage, and the women and children left behind are at increased risk of attacks by bandits.\nA 2021 food and water assessment report for Samburu states that conflicts triggered by \u201ccompetition for rangeland resources \u2026 have resulted in loss of people\u2019s lives and their livelihoods\u201d, with local leaders reporting increasing climate-related cases of domestic violence. Henry Lenayiasa, a chief in Samburu, says cases of violence against women by men who can no longer eke out a living in the harsh environment are on the rise. He says residents may have heard about climate breakdown and how it affects them, \u201cbut men who are unable to cope with the drought take it out on women\u201d. \u201cWe have lost livestock in great numbers during the drought. In Kenya\u2019s arid north, a man without livestock cannot provide and loses self-esteem. This is likely to trigger cases of domestic violence. If we do not address climate matters adequately, such cases will only escalate,\u201d says Lenayiasa.\nWomen in these marginalised communities are exposed to risk of attacks from other men and from wild animals as dwindling resources mean they have to travel farther from their homes to get water or firewood. \u201cNo place is safe for us,\u201d Sitiyan says. \u201cI was almost beaten up after some young men waylaid me on the way to the river, but I managed to escape. It is a risk we take daily in order to provide for our children.\u201d For Sitiyan and the 38 women in Umoja, the nearby Ewaso Ng\u2019iro River was their main source of water. But its flow has been interrupted by extensive droughts that at times left the river bone dry. A decade ago, Nasa\u2019s Earth Observatory described the riverbed as \u201ca pale tan ribbon of sand\u201d after a prolonged drought in 2009. At other times, the river has flooded and displaced thousands. The river has little water currently, and what there is is contaminated by domestic and wild animal waste.\nOn a hot Thursday morning last week, the Guardian joined three women \u2013 Jane Nomong\u2019en, Paulina Lekureiya and Kareni Lematile \u2013 for the 25-minute walk to the river. The unmarked route weaves through thick bushes. \u201cThis is where they hide,\u201d Nomong\u2019en says, pointing to a nearby thicket where a moran (young Samburu warrior) tended some goats. \u201cThere are no men in our village to protect us from the [troublemakers].\u201d Along the route are several water pans dug in recent years to collect rainwater. It never rained.\nA steep gulley leads us to the riverbed where the women find a spot with soft sand and hope it will yield some underground water. Lematile, the youngest, is tasked with scooping out the sand with a cup to make a hole wide enough for water to seep up. It is exhausting. She takes a break every few minutes while the others keep watch. \u201cA 14-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile while fetching water up there,\u201d Lekureiya says. \u201cA woman was also attacked by a crocodile near the same spot. She was five months pregnant. We run away from men only to meet crocodiles.\u201d It takes Lematile 20 minutes of scooping out sand before water begins to collect at the bottom. Using the cup, she painstakingly collects the water in four, 10-litre containers. This takes another hour. The women take a cupful each, and so does Lematile\u2019s son. \u201cWe get some stomach upsets but what options do we have?\u201d says Lematile.\nAbout 100 metres away, a group of young men are scooping out large quantities of sand from the river to fill a truck and sell to developers, much to the chagrin of the women. Sand harvesting leaves the riverbed bare, unable to hold water during the dry season. It also results in floods during heavy rains. The women are afraid that if it goes on they will have to walk even farther to find water, exposing them to more risk of violence and attacks from wild animals. The women in Kenya\u2019s arid areas know that their future security depends on political efforts being made far away this week at the Cop26 climate talks in Scotland, a country where turning on a tap brings instant water. \u201cWorld leaders at Cop26 must deliver on promises to provide finance to these communities to enable them cope with the effects of climate crisis by addressing its root causes,\u201d says Kitui.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/03/we-run-from-men-only-to-meet-crocodiles-kenyas-drought-is-deadly-for-women", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:31:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "A moment that changed me: how a \u2018death knock\u2019 taught me about grief, respect and truth", "article": "I was 19 when, in September 1987, I got a fortnight\u2019s work experience on my local free newspaper, the Kingston Guardian, in south-west London. It was a small but dedicated team of reporters operating out of an office in Twickenham and they were incredibly generous, taking me under their collective wing and sending me out on all kinds of assignments. By the end of the two weeks, I had a handful of bylined pieces and had written my first investigative feature \u2013 a tug-of-love dog ownership dispute over a whippet. But the moment that changed me came on the very first day, on a story that I didn\u2019t even write. The team had suggested I go out in the evening with an older reporter on a \u201cdeath knock\u201d \u2013 going to visit a family after a death. They didn\u2019t call it a death knock and it wasn\u2019t one of those notorious tabloid visits, when a reporter turns up out of the blue and confronts a bereaved family. It had been agreed in advance with the parents of the deceased, a 17-year-old schoolboy who had died in a car accident, not long after passing his driving test. It was the kind of awful, accidental death that happens regularly, all over the country. The reporter drove us to the house and we rang the bell. I was very nervous at the idea of meeting people suffering such grief. But when the father came to the door, he shook our hands, smiled and welcomed us in. He had been waiting for us and was happy to tell us all about the kind, wonderful young man his son had been. We sat on the sofa and I listened while he talked about his son: what a good person he had been, all his achievements at school, his hopes and plans. I still remember that he had got a place at the University of York, because that was where my brother had studied. The reporter was kind and professional and took it all down in shorthand. He asked more questions to make sure he had enough details. It probably took about half an hour. When we had finished, the reporter asked if the family had had a chance to think about a photo for the paper to use. Again, they had asked in advance of the visit. The father had remembered the request and had a lovely portrait ready on the mantelpiece, which he handed over. The reporter said he would make sure it was returned to them. It was very matter-of-fact and very English. The father seemed calm and polite. The reporter was kind and sensitive. I had never confronted death with a stranger before. There were no tears. I felt there might be some small comfort in knowing your child\u2019s life and death were going to be marked and commemorated in the paper. It made me realise how journalists could provide an important service to their community, that they could be welcomed into the home of a bereaved family to help remember a life and record how a loved one mattered. I have taken that memory into every crime story I have covered. In 2006, while working as a reporter at Channel 4 News, I met the family of 15-year-old Rochelle Holness, who had been murdered by a serial rapist, a man with a long criminal record of violence against women. Her remains had been found in bin bags near his flat. The Sun had published a horrible and untrue story, claiming that police told them she had still been alive when he dismembered her body. The Met police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, had recently said the press were racist in how they treated black victims and this seemed evidence of that. Rochelle was a black girl from a south London council estate. Would the Sun have speculated in print that way about a white girl? Rochelle\u2019s mother, Jennifer Bennett, had kept a cuttings book of all the news clippings \u2013 even that Sun story. I was determined to counter the cruelty of those lies. In my report, after the killer was sentenced to a whole-life tariff, I interviewed Bennett, talking about what a fun daughter Rochelle had been. I showed a sequence of photos of her \u2013 from babyhood to her teenage years. She had been a loved child with her whole future ahead of her. I wanted viewers to know that her life mattered. Just as that 17-year-old boy\u2019s had. I still have all my early clippings in a cuttings book. The story of that first death knock isn\u2019t in it, of course, as I didn\u2019t write up the report. But it is the experience that made me the journalist I am. Or at least try to be.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/03/a-moment-that-changed-me-how-a-death-knock-taught-me-about-grief-respect-and-truth", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:13:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},

You didn\u2019t have to go out to him with no guns. \u201cBut I know God is going to deal with them.\u201d\nIt was February last year when Ahmaud Arbery, a Black 25-year-old, was jogging in the small coastal town of Satilla Shores. The three men accused of murder, Gregory McMichael, 67, his 35-year-old son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52, all pursued Arbery claiming they suspected him of involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood. Arbery had been recorded on surveillance footage entering and leaving a semi-constructed house in the area, but no evidence has linked him to any offense. A scuffle occurred as the McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery, who was unarmed, with their pickup truck. Travis McMichael then opened fire three times with a shotgun. On Tuesday, after 11 days of jury selection, a panel of 65 jurors was finally selected from a pool of hundreds. Barring any unforeseen delays, including last-minute motions defense attorneys have suggested they will file, a final jury of 12 and four alternates will be seated this week, with opening arguments to follow, probably on Thursday. The trial of the three men, who have pleaded not guilty, occurs six months after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis after pinning his neck to the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. That trial was undoubtedly a landmark moment for police reform advocates around the country, but, say many observers, the case of Ahmaud Arbery is a sterner litmus test for the state of racial justice in the US.\n\u201cThis case is almost a straight line from Emmett Till,\u201d said the civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who represents the Arbery family. \u201cOur legal system is statistically and continuously biased but it\u2019s more of a test than Minneapolis and George Floyd because we are in the heart of white supremacy here in south Georgia.\u201d Merritt\u2019s point was illustrated by the immediate surroundings. He spoke to the Guardian on the steps of the courthouse \u2013 less than a mile away a monument to the Confederacy, wrapped in protective plastic since the start of the trial, still stands in a local park. City officials have said it will eventually be removed. But the legal particulars of this murder trial also point to history as well. The McMichaels\u2019 defense is expected to hinge on a now defunct Georgia law that traces its roots to the state\u2019s era of slavery and essentially allowed private citizens the power to arrest people if they had \u201creasonable and probable grounds of suspicion\u201d of a felony being committed. In the wake of mass protest following Arbery\u2019s death, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor repealed the law, but attorneys for all three defendants are expected to utilize it throughout the trial. \u201cThey changed the law, but changing the law doesn\u2019t affect us. It doesn\u2019t change what was the law of the land at the time,\u201d said Bryan\u2019s defence attorney, Kevin Gough, last month.\nThe backstory to the prosecution, too, points to evidence of insider politics and institutional racism in the local criminal justice world here. One of the first prosecutors assigned to the case, George Barnhill, initially recommended not charging any of those involved, claiming the pursuit was \u201cperfectly legal\u201d due to citizen\u2019s arrest statutes. Barnhill, who had a chequered history of aggressively prosecuting Black residents in his jurisdiction, eventually recused himself from the case. Another former prosecutor initially assigned the case, Jackie Johnson, has been criminally charged for alleged misconduct in the process as Gregory McMichael had worked as an investigator in her office. The past two weeks have also highlighted the difficulties in impaneling a jury in this small rural county, composed of 69% white residents and 26% Black residents, and which voted 61% for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Defense lawyers have argued many potential jurors have not shown up for jury duty as the court whittled the final number down to 65 people. Prospective jurors were questioned about their prior knowledge of the case, whether they had expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and if they knew any of those involved. In a striking remark on Friday last week defense attorney Gough complained to the judge: \u201cIt would appear that white males born in the south over 40 years old without a college degree \u2026 which he might also be known as Bubba or Joe Sixpack \u2026 seem to be significantly underrepresented.\u201d Still, despite these hurdles, Merritt was explicit about his expectations for accountability in the case: \u201cWe expect convictions on all charges. These men should be in prison for the rest of their lives. That will get us on the road to justice.\u201d *** Among the small group of activists seated on the grass outside the courthouse was 68-year-old Patricia Fields, from the nearby town of Waycross. Like Diane Arbery Jackson she too has come to the courthouse every day and, in a recent week, went to visit Satilla Shores, the small neighborhood where Arbery was killed. \u201cIt\u2019s eerie there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a shadow over it. That something is just not right.\u201d\nOn a trip earlier this week few residents of Satilla Shores wanted to speak about the Arbery murder case. Along neatly kept lawns, a number of houses still display Trump 2020 presidential campaign placards and a golf cart was daubed in a sign that read: \u201cImpeach Biden\u201d. There is no memorial or marker at the site where Arbery was gunned down. For a case that is tied so deeply to atrocities of the past, the murder of Ahmaud Arbery is also closely linked to prosecutions from recent memory. The presence of eyewitness video, filmed by Bryan as he took part in the pursuit from behind, is set to play a pivotal role in the case. It took months for the footage to emerge, as the case sat in relative obscurity away from the gaze of most national media. The absence of publicly available footage undoubtedly contributed to the initial decision not to indict the three men now standing trial. It was not until the video was made public that the case was handed to Georgia state investigators who promptly recommended charges against the accused. In the same way that Darnella Frazier\u2019s eyewitness video of the murder of George Floyd thrust the incident into global consciousness and played a pivotal role at the trial of Derek Chauvin, so too does this footage hold the key to the case. The trial also bears striking similarities to the prosecution of George Zimmerman, charged with the murder of the unarmed Black teenager Trayvon Martin in the neighboring state of Florida in 2012. Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman who shot and killed Martin after chasing him down for \u201csuspicious\u201d activity, was acquitted at trial claiming self-defense under stand your ground statutes \u2013 a similar line of argument tied to self-defense that the McMichaels are likely to make at trial. Crucially, however, there was no witness video in the Zimmerman trial. *** Diane Arbery Jackson ate lunch on the lawn; shrimp, corn and grilled potatoes, donated to the small group of activists by a local racial justice coalition. She told the Guardian of her fondest memories of her nephew, whose death prompted the state of Georgia to ratify its first hate crime statute in June last year. \u201cHe always showed love to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time he sees you, he always gives you a kiss. \u2018I love you,\u2019 he always said. \u2018I\u2019m good.\u2019\u201d She described her family\u2019s history in Brunswick, which dated back to beyond the civil rights era. Her father and grandmother had marched in the 1960s, she said and were beaten by white residents. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to keep doing this, so we can keep going where they left off at. We have to come together as a community and continue the fight.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-trial-accused-killers-test-us-racial-justice", "last_update": "2021-11-03T03:23:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Capita pays compensation to family of woman who died after benefits cut", "article": "A government contractor has paid out \u201csubstantial\u201d compensation following the death of a young mother who took an overdose after her disability benefits were removed. Philippa Day, 27, a single mother from Nottingham who had longstanding mental health issues, died in hospital in October 2019, two months after taking an overdose. She had endured months of stress and anxiety after a long struggle with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Capita to reinstate her benefits. An inquest into her death identified 28 instances where \u201csystemic errors\u201d by both the DWP and its contractor had led to failures in the handling of Day\u2019s claim. These failures were a \u201cstressor\u201d in her decision to take the overdose, the coroner ruled, although he was unable to conclude she had intended to take her own life. In May, Day\u2019s family issued a compensation claim for negligence to both the DWP and Capita. The latter subsequently agreed to settle out of court. The sum was not disclosed but is understood to be in line with what the family was asking for. The family said the money would be used to provide for Day\u2019s son\u2019s future. Imogen Day, Philippa\u2019s sister, said: \u201cOur family has always maintained that my sister\u2019s treatment by Capita, on behalf of the DWP, directly impacted her mental state and in the end is the reason for her death. Capita\u2019s wall of bureaucracy, with no consideration for Philippa\u2019s mental state, exacerbated her despair at her debt and poverty. She was met with cold, uncaring call operators who would not listen to her cries for help.\u201d She added: \u201cThis settlement will in some measure provide for Philippa\u2019s family and a materially stable upbringing for Philippa\u2019s son, but he has lost his mother, and there is nothing Capita can do to put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa\u2019s death.\u201d It is believed to be the first time an agent of the DWP has settled a legal claim brought as a result of their errors. Capita, which administers disability benefits under contract to DWP, has also agreed to meet the family to discuss ways to improve its interactions with benefits claimants. A Capita spokesperson said: \u201cWe are very sorry for the mistakes we made in processing Philippa\u2019s personal independence payment (PIP) claim and the additional stress this caused her. In partnership with the DWP, we have considered and reviewed the coroner\u2019s report and we are implementing all the recommendations that are relevant to us. \u201cFollowing this incident, we have strengthened our processes and we are working to continuously improve and deliver a professional, efficient and kind service for every PIP applicant we assess.\u201d The family\u2019s lawyer, Merry Varney of solicitors Leigh Day, welcomed the settlement: \u201cCapita has shown acceptance of their failures and a willingness to ensure their mistakes are not repeated. However, there remain too many examples of the DWP, which controls the financial circumstances of the majority of people too sick to work, acting inhumanely to those receiving benefits and a continued resistance by the DWP to transparent investigations into benefit-related deaths.\u201d A DWP spokesperson said in statement: \u201cOur condolences remain with the Day family. We cannot comment on active legal proceedings.\u201d It is not clear to which legal proceedings they refer to as Leigh Day has confirmed Capita\u2019s settlement means no further legal action is outstanding regarding the Philippa Day case. The DWP was issued by the coroner with a prevention of future deaths notice at the inquest requiring it to set out how it would improve its services. In its formal response in April it said it recognised \u201cthe need to treat everyone with empathy and care; especially those with mental health conditions\u201d. It said it had introduced specialist mental health and behaviour and relationships training for all new staff handling disability benefits. It added it was \u201cdetermined to learn from this deeply tragic case\u201d. Day was described by her family as an intelligent, beautiful and \u201ceffervescent\u201d woman who loved her young son and had ambitions to train as a nurse. She had endured mental illness and type 1 diabetes since childhood. She had a record of self-harm and suicide attempts and had several stays in psychiatric care. Her life became increasingly stressful and chaotic after her benefits were reduced from \u00a3228 a week to just \u00a360 as a result of a botched benefits application. Her distressed state was captured in a recording of a phone call to a benefits official in June 2019, played at the inquest, in which she pleaded for help. In tears, Day had told the official: \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for six months now. I\u2019m literally starving, I can\u2019t survive for much longer.\u201d She added: \u201c[I\u2019m in] \u00a35,000 debt. Nothing to eat. I\u2019ve lost all my [benefit] premiums \u2026 I cannot survive \u2026 without any money. I need something to live for.\u201d After her benefits were finally reinstated, Day \u2013 who was agoraphobic \u2013 became increasingly terrified and anxious as DWP officials insisted she be retested at a face-to-face meeting at a benefits assessment centre or face losing her benefits. Her sister told the inquest this was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/03/capita-pays-compensation-family-woman-who-died-after-benefits-cut-philippa-day", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:58:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},

No, according to Dug, the drink is \u201ca patented emulsion of potatoes and rapeseed oil developed by Professor Eva Tornberg at Lund University in Sweden\u201d. Yum? Potatoes may be hot now, but the emulsified spud people shouldn\u2019t get complacent. The milk market is fiercely competitive. Any minute now, camel milk might become the hipster alt-milk beverage of choice.

{"title": "Cleo Smith found: first pictures of smiling girl as Australian police detail moment of rescue", "article": "A photograph of a smiling and waving Cleo Smith eating an ice treat in her hospital bed has been released by Western Australia police after the four-year-old was rescued from a Carnarvon house more than two weeks after she vanished from a remote campsite.\nWA police on Wednesday afternoon said a 36-year-old man taken into custody following Cleo\u2019s discovery was yet to be charged but they expected that to occur \u201cprobably\u201d later in the day. Investigators have said the man had no connection to Cleo\u2019s family and he only became a suspect in the alleged abduction on Tuesday night. In a press conference outside the Carnarvon police station on Wednesday afternoon, the commissioner, Chris Dawson, held up the picture of Cleo declaring \u201cit is a wonderful day\u201d. The picture was taken earlier on Wednesday when Cleo was in hospital where she had been taken for medical tests. She had since been discharged and was back with her parents. Police also released footage from an officer\u2019s body camera showing the moment Cleo was carried out of the Carnarvon house.\n\u201cIt is a really special day for Western Australia,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cI\u2019m just the proudest police commissioner I think in the world at the moment.\u201d Det Sgt Cameron Blaine, who was one of the four officers who raided the house in Carnarvon and was the one to ask Cleo what her name was, described the four-year-old as \u201cvery trusting and open\u201d with officers. He also said she was energetic. \u201cShe\u2019s a little Energizer bunny,\u201d he said. \u201cHow she has that much energy. I wish I did. We all wanted to take turns holding her.\u201d Blaine said Wednesday morning was \u201cthe best moment\u201d of his career. He described the moment Cleo was reunited with her family and said the four-year-old exclaimed \u201cmum\u201d. There were \u201cbig hugs, kisses and lots of tears\u201d, Blaine said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nDet Supt Rod Wilde, who led the investigation, said Wednesday morning\u2019s news came as an \u201cabsolute surprise\u201d to Cleo\u2019s parents and \u201cthey were ecstatic\u201d. Cleo\u2019s mother, Ellie Smith, posted on Instagram about 6am local time about her daughter\u2019s discovery with the caption \u201cour family is whole again\u201d. Dawson said chocolates and flowers had been left at the police station throughout Wednesday.\nThe WA police minister, Paul Papalia, said: \u201cIf you feel the need to thank God today, thank God for the West Australian police force. Cleo\u2019s rescue wasn\u2019t the result of an accidental sighting or a suspicious event, it was the result of hard police grind from the moment this incident began.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Cleo\u2019s disappearance had \u201ccaptured the hearts of Australians\u201d and \u201cI just thank God that Cleo is home and that she is safe\u201d. \u201cThe fact that that nightmare has come to an end and our worst fears were not realised is just a huge relief and a moment for great joy,\u201d Morrison said during a press conference in Dubai on Wednesday.\nThe West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said Cleo\u2019s discovery was a surprise. \u201cIt often is a tragic outcome [in such cases] but this is great news and uplifting for the entire country,\u201d McGowan said. Police officers found Cleo about 1am local time on Wednesday morning alone in a room at a house in Carnarvon, a town roughly 900km north of Perth on WA\u2019s north-west coast, and just 75km from where her family was camping when she disappeared from their tent in the early hours of 16 October. Investigators said they received information on Tuesday that, together with previous findings, led them to the Carnarvon address where Cleo was found. Deputy police commissioner Col Blanch, speaking to the ABC on Wednesday evening, said police had prior \u201cinformation on our records\u201d about the 36-year-old. Police earlier said they did not expect anyone to claim the $1m reward for information about Cleo\u2019s whereabouts that had been offered by the WA government \u2013 the equal largest reward ever offered by the state.

{"title": "Commonwealth Bank to offer cryptocurrency trading in first for Australia\u2019s big four", "article": "The Commonwealth Bank will allow its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its app, in the first move of its kind by a major Australian bank. Australia\u2019s largest bank announced on Wednesday it had partnered with US-based crypto exchange Gemini and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to offer the service to its 6.5m CommBank app users. Customers will be able to buy up to 10 crypto assets including bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. The bank will conduct a pilot in the next few weeks, ahead of a wider launch in 2022.\n\u201cWe believe we can play an important role in crypto to address what\u2019s clearly a growing customer need and provide capability, security and confidence in a crypto trading platform,\u201d CBA\u2019s chief executive Matt Comyn said in a statement. The bank said research on its customers found many had either expressed interest in crypto assets, or were already trading crypto through exchanges. \u201cCustomers have expressed concern regarding some of the crypto services in the market today, including the friction of using third party exchanges, the risk of fraud, and the lack of trust in some new providers. This is why we see this as an opportunity to bring a trusted and secure experience for our customers,\u201d Comyn said. Dr Dimitrios Salampasis, a lecturer of fintech leadership and entrepreneurship at Swinburne Business School, said he was not surprised CBA had entered the cryptocurrency field. He said the bank was trying to get first mover advantage in Australia, and hoped it would bring more legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space. \u201cHaving this coming from a systemic and the biggest bank in Australia, it\u2019s definitely a move that will change a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will hopefully bring legitimacy, bring further harmonisation, push further regulation and also minimise debanking, which has been a massive pain for all cryptocurrency startups in particular.\u201d Debanking is where financial institutions refuse to offer services to businesses in Australia. A Senate select committee report on fintech services in Australia, tabled this month, cited several cryto businesses that had been rejected by dozens of financial institutions in Australia, such as the exchange Bitcoin Babe. The committee, chaired by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, recommended the government regulate the sector to allow it to fully operate in Australia, including a market licensing regime for digital currency exchanges, and for the government to develop a clear process for businesses to deal with debanking. Salampasis said the committee\u2019s report, along with CBA\u2019s gradual move into the sector, would likely foster regulation of cryptocurrency in Australia. \u201cThere has to be regulation, there has to be provisions, especially in relation to custody, especially in relation to licensing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI do believe that Australia has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a leader in the space and really drive a complete regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.\u201d Bragg welcomed the announcement from CBA. \u201cFor too long, banks have cast aside cryptocurrency as an illegitimate fringe pursuit. I am pleased the tide is turning, as digital assets are mainstreamed,\u201d he said. \u201cNow banks are adopting cryptocurrency, they should stop \u2018debanking\u2019 hardworking Australians.\u201d CBA told the committee that it \u201cdoes not have a policy\u201d around debanking due to \u201ccompetitive or market factors\u201d but when making a decision on lending to new customers, \u201cwe take a range of risk considerations into account including the terms and conditions of any loan documentation and possible security provisions provided.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/commonwealth-bank-to-offer-cryptocurrency-trading-in-first-for-australias-big-four", "last_update": "2021-11-03T06:47:37Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018It\u2019s absolutely insane\u2019: the shocking story of the US-based Nazi camp", "article": "Too vast in scope to be contained within war drama, the Holocaust movie constitutes an entire genre unto itself, collecting a potentially infinite number of tragedies great and small. The history of the 20th century\u2019s most massive atrocity comes with thousands of footnotes now gradually expanded upon by media depicting the unsung courage and untold evil. Israeli documentary film-makers Daniel Sivan and Mor Loushy singled out one such extraordinary tale for their latest joint project, Netflix\u2019s short film Camp Confidential, drawing attention to a highly covert military operation only recently released from behind redaction-marker bars. \u201cThe first thing is, when producers Benji and Jono Bergmann approached us with this and told us of the story, we didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Sivan tells the Guardian. \u201cIt was just so out-there.\u201d\nThe black-op facility tucked away in northern Virginia\u2019s Fairfax county sounds like something out of a pulp paperback: Jewish soldiers, many of them refugees from the devastation in Europe, watched over Nazi prisoners of war in a surreally domestic setting. Known as PO Box 1142, it housed such notables as spymaster Reinhard Gehlen and rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who faced interrogations that would help lift the Allies to victory in the second world war. But those in charge of the base were also tasked with maintaining a baseline quality of life for the inmates, leading to bizarre scenes such as a department store outing with former members of the Third Reich to purchase unmentionables for their wives. Bulldozed at the end of the war and buried in secrecy until the National Parks Service unearthed some remnants in the early 2000s, the clandestine camp now doubles as a cautionary tale for modern Jews and a memorial for those who came before them. \u201cWe had hours of these interviews, and I remember very vividly that we were shocked,\u201d Loushy says. \u201cI had chills. This was an unbelievable relationship forming there, between the Jewish refugees and the Nazis who would\u2019ve captured them. Nobody knew about it, and the people who conducted the interviews never told anyone about it. They didn\u2019t even tell their wives or children \u2013they took this secret to their grave.\u201d\nSivan and Loushy had the privilege of sitting down with Arno Mayer and Peter Wiess, two veterans of this odd operation, thought to be the last living survivors able to set the record straight. With candor and a little apprehension, the two men recall a confounding daily contrast, caught between the satisfaction of sweating their captive guests and the indignity of catering to their needs. In one of the many flashback scenes rendered as animation to capture the dreamlike quality of memory, we see Jewish soldiers using the Nazis\u2019 own inhumanity against them by flooding a van with dust from a vacuum cleaner and letting the sadists assume they were being gassed, just like they\u2019d be doing if the positions were reversed. The former servicemen claim to have taken the high ground and avoided outright torture, instead gaining the prisoners\u2019 trust by playing host in their new country of America. \u201cYou can hear so many instances of them asking the interviewers, \u2018Is this safe? Can we talk? Is this not censored?\u2019\u201d Sivan says. \u201cIt took everybody a long time to understand that yes, it is safe to discuss this. When you listen to the audio tapes, once they started talking, you see a combination of pride and shame at the same time. On the one hand, they feel that they did collect important intelligence, and they did succeed in their mission. But on the other, they did take part in whitewashing the German ex-Nazi scientists into becoming the perfect American heroes.\u201d As the film explains, there\u2019s a bitter irony to the fate of Wernher von Braun, vilified during the war right up until the US government figured his scientific acumen could be put to good use. Under Operation Paperclip, hundreds of Nazi technicians were brought to the States and put to work before they could get snapped up by Space Race rivals in the Soviet Union, an unsavory gambit that paid off when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon. But the image rehabilitation von Braun enjoyed as a principal architect of rocket travel \u2013 the medals, the smiling photo ops next to President Kennedy \u2013 left a bad taste in the mouths of those who recalled his heinous deeds. \u201cWe all know that [von Braun] knew about Auschwitz, and that he participated with the Nazi regime,\u201d Loushy says. \u201cThe US, in giving him citizenship with all the other scientists, showed what was important to them.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re different, Arno and Peter,\u201d Sivan adds. \u201cWhat Peter really wanted to convey was the question of whether bad means can be justified by a good cause. He believed the cause was righteous, but that the means of achieving it were so corrupt that it wasn\u2019t worth it. Arno, however, wanted to talk about the cold war. During the second world war, while the fighting was still going on, his mission was to start fighting the Russians. The fact is that the US had already targeted a new archenemy, and it\u2019s shocking to see how fluid it is, the changing of enemies. Who was once your friend and ally is now the source of all evil. And these Nazis, who were the pinnacle of evil, were suddenly our best friends.\u201d\nThe film-makers view this chapter of the past as a moral and ethical thought experiment with ample resonance to the present, weighing pragmatism in the national interest against the sin of whitewashing. Does building an effective coalition supersede the mandate to hold fascists accountable for their actions? Neither Sivan nor Loushy is all that convinced. \u201cI personally believe that evil is evil, and don\u2019t think that a few years can change that,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople taking part in mass murder, even if they were not physically part of it, they were in support of it.\u201d \u201cYou see these Jewish refugees who\u2019d escaped Europe a few years before, all of their families murdered in the Holocaust, and now they\u2019ve got to form a relationship with Nazis?\u201d Loushy adds. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. There\u2019s a red line to causes, at the end of the day. The Nazis committed crimes against humanity.\u201d With domestic Nazi activity and Russia paranoia both having spiked under Trump, the takeaway from this brutal social studies lesson is clear: the nasty tendency to overlook transgressions for the sake of political usefulness hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. We\u2019re still repeating the mistakes of previous generations, putting what\u2019s expedient over what\u2019s right, leaving the civilian souls caught in the crossfire to be forgotten, abandoned, or ignored. Mayer and Weiss share their recollections in the hope that we can break this cycle, and hold our leaders to a higher standard of humanity. \u201cThis is not a story of the past,\u201d Sivan says. \u201cThe US is collaborating today with a bunch of dark regimes, Israel as well. If you look anywhere in the world, Europe or Asia, everyone\u2019s working with tyrants and other people who have blood on their hands. It\u2019s always in the \u2018national interest,\u2019 too. This isn\u2019t a story about terrible things that happened back in the \u201940s.

There is a prosperity of news today, and prosperity ought to be shared. The heatwaves and wildfires that caused devastation in Europe this summer would not have happened without global heating, new analysis shows. The summer of 2021 was the hottest ever recorded on the continent, with average temperatures about 1C above normal that caused wildfires and premature deaths. There is a stark message from scientists to leaders at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow: if countries do not achieve drastic reductions in carbon emissions by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050, the record heat of 2021 will strike every year by the end of the century. Meanwhile a new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) and PwC says creating an international price for carbon emissions could reduce global greenhouse gases by 12% at a cost of less than 1% of global GDP. The cost would be less than the economic losses triggered by the fallout of a runaway climate crisis, with the \u201ccarbon revenues\u201d raked in from polluters used to help hard-pressed households or ploughed back into green industries. Joe Biden has attacked the failure of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to attend the Cop26 summit. \u201cThey didn\u2019t show up \u2026 It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away,\u201d he said, also criticising Russia and Vladimir Putin. \u201cHow do you do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?\u201d * * * \u2018Hope was never lost\u2019 \u2013 Four-year-old Cleo Smith, who went missing from a campsite in Western Australia more than two weeks ago, has been found alive and well. Police said they had found Cleo alone in a house in Carnarvon at 1am on Wednesday and arrested a man soon afterwards. Cleo was reunited with her parents a short time later. The state police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said police had a 36-year-old man in custody and there was \u201cno family connection\u201d.\n\u201cTo find a little girl, a vulnerable little girl, after 18 days, you know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly, hope was never lost,\u201d Dawson said. The deputy commissioner, Col Blanch, said police broke into the locked house and found Cleo in one of the rooms. \u201cOne of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her, \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u201cShe said, \u2018My name is Cleo.\u2019\u201d * * * Midweek catch-up > In Virginia, the Republican Glenn Youngkin will be the next governor after an upset victory over the Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe that is a blow to Joe Biden.

The exit clears the way for Dacre, 72, to make a new application to be chair of Ofcom after he failed the interview process on the previous attempt despite the backing of Downing Street. The new job advert has been rewritten to favour a more confrontational candidate after Dacre was judged not to have met the original criteria. Dacre stood down as editor of the Daily Mail in 2018.

{"title": "The Macron spat over Aukus submarines has taught world leaders a lot about Scott Morrison | Katharine Murphy", "article": "As Scott Morrison flew towards Australia\u2019s military base for operations in the Middle East on Wednesday, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault was using an appearance at the National Press Club in Canberra to continue France\u2019s rolling excoriation of Australia\u2019s conduct while dumping a multibillion-dollar submarine contract. By the time Morrison touched down in the desert, the French ambassador had landed a potent extrapolation. If Scott Morrison\u2019s operation was prepared to leak private text messages from world leaders to settle diplomatic scores, who could trust Australia?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t behave like this on personal exchanges of leaders,\u201d Th\u00e9bault said in Canberra. \u201cDoing this also sends a very worrying signal for all heads of state. Beware, in Australia, there will be leaks, and what you say in confidence to your partners will eventually be used and weaponised against you.\u201d I doubt you\u2019ve missed the saga of the text messages, but just in case \u2013 the morning after Emmanuel Macron told Australian journalists on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome that Morrison had lied to him during the fracas, one of the president\u2019s private texts turned up in some Australian media outlets. Two days before Morrison, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden terminated Australia\u2019s contract with the French Naval Group to build diesel submarines in mid-September and replaced it with the Aukus pact, Macron had asked Morrison: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d This text was submitted as evidence that Macron\u2019s outrage \u2013 the accusations about lying and Australia stabbing France in the back \u2013 were entirely confected, because the president knew all along the French contract was about to be dumped. Actually, the message confirmed exactly the opposite. It shows Macron didn\u2019t know what was happening two days before three leaders humiliated France with the Aukus announcement \u2013 which you\u2019ll recall was livestreamed to the world. So as ruthless exercises in domestic damage control go, this was a particularly wild one. Measured in terms of international relations, this was high-cost, low-efficiency. Presumably, the score-settling reflected the fury of Australia\u2019s prime minister after Macron launched his drive-by character assassination at the G20. Morrison was as angry as I have ever seen him on learning of Macron\u2019s accusation. But if it was an impulse, a lashing out, his revenge play, once unleashed, could not be rescinded. Morrison has had plenty of opportunities to deny his office leaked the texts. He has not done so. He has also not expressed any remorse about it either. Asked on the ground at the Al Minhad air base what the threshold had been for engaging in retributive conduct entirely outside diplomatic rules of engagement \u2013 was the trigger one world leader (Macron) accusing another one (Morrison) of lying \u2013 Morrison doubled down. \u201cClaims had been made and those claims were refuted,\u201d the prime minister said. Implicit in this is Macron was the one who shifted the goalposts by launching a personal attack. Morrison does have a point. There was nothing diplomatic in the French president\u2019s observation at the G20. It was an extraordinary moment. Morrison responded with an extraordinary moment of his own.\nBut the rapid escalation has removed all the guard rails and conventions that normally restrain the apex predators of politics from engaging in unmasked aggression against their peers. Morrison understood he was now in uncharted territory \u2013 which is why the prime minister declared an armistice during his brief stopover in the Middle East. The prime minister thought now everybody had got various things off their chests, it was time to get past the muck. \u201cClaims were made and claims were refuted, what is needed now is for us to move on \u2013 that is what is important the Australian people\u201d. What\u2019s important, according to Morrison\u2019s telling, was he, Scott Morrison, had made the right call by replacing French diesel powered submarines with nuclear ones. He, Morrison, had \u201cdelivered an incredibly important capability to Australia to keep us safe and defend and protect Australia \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing, that is what is at issue here\u201d. \u201cThat is the thing that matters most to Australians \u2013 that we do everything we can to ensure the Australian defences are the best they possibly can be and the men and women who serve get the best. That\u2019s what I was seeking to do and if others have other motives, others have other agendas, well that\u2019s for them\u201d. The means justify the ends, in other words. Nothing else matters. Morrison is still a relatively new player on the global stage, but his global counterparts have learned something important about Australia\u2019s prime minister in this episode. Morrison doesn\u2019t need to be liked. He doesn\u2019t need to be trusted \u2013 and in a domestic political context, Morrison is not trusted either by colleagues or by adversaries. Morrison\u2019s confidence in his own instincts and decisions is absolute.\nHe doesn\u2019t need anyone to prop him up, or validate his choices. His emotional hinterland is outside of politics. In the prime ministership, he is an island. What\u2019s important is the will to power, which for Morrison, takes form in a sense of relentless righteousness. What is important to Morrison is whatever it takes to win the next political battle. International relations are only important insofar as they express themselves through the prism of domestic politics. Morrison thinks he\u2019s on a winner. Macron might be a casualty of that. Australian taxpayers might have to fork out billions to decouple from the Naval Group. But if it\u2019s a winning play, the costs don\u2019t matter.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/the-macron-spat-over-aukus-submarines-has-taught-world-leaders-a-lot-about-scott-morrison", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:14:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "French ambassador says leak of Macron text \u2018new low\u2019 as submarines rift deepens", "article": "The French ambassador has denounced the Australian government\u2019s release of a private text message from Emmanuel Macron as \u201can unprecedented new low\u201d, arguing other world leaders would now worry their words might be \u201cweaponised\u201d against them. Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault said the leaking of the text message from the French president was a setback \u201cin terms of truth and trust\u201d, and it would be \u201csad\u201d if this was the Australian government\u2019s answer to France\u2019s request for concrete actions to heal the relationship. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters in Dubai on Wednesday he would \u201cnever make any apologies\u201d for scrapping the French contract to deliver submarines that were \u201cnot going to do the job that Australia needed [them] to do\u201d. Morrison did not dispute a suggestion that his office had leaked the text message, simply saying: \u201cClaims had been made and those claims were refuted \u2026 what is needed now is for us to move on.\u201d The extraordinary rift between Australia and France flows from Macron\u2019s accusation that Morrison lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines as a replacement for the $90bn French project. Morrison rejected Macron\u2019s claim and several Australian media outlets then reported that the French president had texted the Australian prime minister two days before the Aukus announcement in mid-September to ask: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d Th\u00e9bault said far from backing the Australian government\u2019s position that it had been candid with France about its changing needs, the text \u201cdemonstrates that until the last minute, we didn\u2019t know where things were heading to\u201d. The French ambassador told the National Press Club in Canberra the leak of the text would not help build confidence to repair the relationship. \u201cThis is an unprecedented new low - in terms of how to proceed, and also, in terms of truth and trust,\u201d Th\u00e9bault said. \u201cYou don\u2019t behave like this on personal exchanges of leaders who are allies. But maybe it\u2019s just confirmation that we were never seen as an ally. \u201cBut doing so also sends a very worrying signal for all heads of state - beware, in Australia, there will be leaks, and what you say in confidence to your partners will be eventually used and weaponised against you one day.\u201d Asked whether Morrison should apologise to Macron \u2013 a suggestion made by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 the ambassador said the US had taken concrete steps to mend ties over what Joe Biden called the \u201cclumsy\u201d handling of the Aukus partnership. Th\u00e9bault said eating \u201chumble pie\u201d may \u201csometimes be difficult\u201d and it was \u201cup to everyone to make his own decision\u201d. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, defended the release of the text message, suggesting Macron had triggered that action by claiming Morrison had lied. \u201cIt [the leak] is not as extraordinary as calling the leader of another country a liar when they\u2019re not,\u201d Joyce told ABC TV. The French ambassador was recalled to Paris in September after Australia scrapped a $90bn French deal in order to launch an 18-month study with the US and the UK on acquiring nuclear-propelled submarines. Having now returned to Canberra, Th\u00e9bault said the Morrison government had acted in a way that was \u201cout of this world\u201d and not befitting of friends, and he questioned whether any other partner could now trust \u201cthe value of Australia\u2019s signature and commitment\u201d. Th\u00e9bault also raised doubts about whether Australia\u2019s new partnership with the US and the UK would deliver nuclear-propelled submarines quickly enough: \u201cMagical thinking will not change the facts.\u201d\nAnd he said Australia would be scrutinised by the rest of the world over its \u201cvery specific responsibilities\u201d, arguing the deal could have implications \u201cin terms of our common efforts to strengthen nonproliferation norms\u201d. \u201cFrance will always be a close and loyal friend of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cNo artificial wedge, despite attempts, can be put between our people. If there is a problem today it is with certain aspects of the \u2018Canberra bubble\u2019 and its \u2018secret city\u2019 practices.\u201d Th\u00e9bault said the defence and foreign ministers of France and Australia met just two weeks before Aukus was announced, with both sides agreeing to a joint statement that underlined the importance of the future submarine program. \u201cDo you agree on such a joint communique when there is the slightest doubt on something so massive as the official backbone of our cooperation? Maybe on Mars. But not on this planet,\u201d Th\u00e9bault said. Th\u00e9bault suggested that the reason the Australian government did not want to be explicit was explained by Morrison on 16 September, when the prime minister said there was never any certainty that the Aukus process would result in a deal. Th\u00e9bault said that meant it was deemed necessary to keep open the possibility of continuing the French submarine program, \u201cand so it was mandatory to keep us in the dark, on the backburner\u201d. Arguing \u201cthe deceit was intentional\u201d, Th\u00e9bault said: \u201cBecause there was far more at stake than providing submarines, because it was a common agreement on sovereignty, sealed with the transmission of highly classified data, the way it was handled was a stab in the back.\u201d He acknowledged that the Australian government would make its own decisions when it came to national security. \u201cBut the way this Australian government decided to turn its back on our solemn and far reaching partnership, without ever frankly consulting with France, when there were countless opportunities, without having shared frankly and openly its thoughts or without having looked for alternatives with France, is just out of this world,\u201d Th\u00e9bault said. \u201cAlarm bells should have rung on the likely consequences. And if it was the case, and they were disregarded, it is even worse.\u201d\nTh\u00e9bault said the Naval Group-backed project to deliver 12 conventional submarines had not been \u201ctroubled\u201d or suffered cost blowouts, despite an \u201cintensive smearing campaign\u201d about the program.

{"title": "\u2018Our generation\u2019s Emmett Till\u2019: what happened to Kendrick Johnson?", "article": "America\u2019s recent focus on 22-year-old Gabby Petito, whose body was found last month in a remote part of Wyoming, revived criticism of \u201cmissing white woman syndrome\u201d and the media\u2019s failure to convey that Black lives matter too. There are few starker example than Kendrick Johnson, an African American teenager found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his high school gymnasium in 2013. How and why he lost his life remains a mystery that has never been solved.\n\u201cKendrick went missing: nobody searched for him,\u201d his mother, Jacqueline Johnson, says to the Guardian by phone from Valdosta, Georgia. \u201cNobody called a US marshal or the FBI for him. Nobody called all those people in. They didn\u2019t put it all over the news. They didn\u2019t do none of it. \u201cYou see the imbalance right there. If a Black person goes missing it\u2019s just like they don\u2019t really care. As soon she [Gabby Petito] goes missing, because of her colour, she gets all the media, all the shows, everything. Everywhere you see Ms Petito. Nobody else matters.\u201d Local and state authorities ruled 17-year-old Kendrick\u2019s death a freak accident, concluding that he got stuck in the middle of the mat while reaching for a gym shoe and was unable to breathe. Jacqueline and her husband Kenneth insist that he was murdered, accuse law enforcement and school officials of a cover-up and continue to wage a campaign for the truth. The case is the subject of a new documentary, Finding Kendrick Johnson, based on a four-year undercover investigation into a tangled web of allegations, new evidence and alarming questions over authorities\u2019 handling of the tragedy. With didactic narration by actor and activist Jenifer Lewis, the film demands that attention must be paid.\nKendrick was a sports-loving teenager. Jacqueline, 49, recalls: \u201cHe was the baby of our family. He was just like the funniest person ever. He played three sports all the way up through high school: he played football and basketball and he ran track. Football was his passion in life. Older kids looked up to him because he would say, \u2018Yeah, one day I\u2019m going to make it in football. Y\u2019all going to see.\u2019\u201d The bright shard of memory darkens. \u201cThey just took his dream away and they took our goal away because that was our goal for him. He loved football. I would say two or three years old, he was out there playing football with his dad and brothers, and then when he was old enough to get on the field, he was playing football ever since he was four years old.\u201d When she thinks of Kendrick now, Jacqueline says, \u201cit\u2019s so much hurt, so much pain. We can\u2019t even really begin to grieve or mourn because of the fight we\u2019ve had to endure.\u201d Fellow students found Kendrick\u2019s body in the gymnasium at Lowndes high school in Valdosta \u2013 a town in the deep south where Confederate monuments still stand - at around 10.30am on 11 January 2013. Kendrick was 5ft 10in; the rolled up mat is 6ft tall. The mat was propped upright against a wall next to the gym bleachers. Sheriff\u2019s investigators closed the case four months later, concluding that Kendrick died in a bizarre accident while reaching for a shoe inside one of the mats. A state medical examiner ruled the cause of death was \u201cpositional asphyxia\u201d, meaning the teenager got stuck upside down in a position that left him unable to breathe. But Kendrick\u2019s family were left with many unanswered questions. There were strange gaps in surveillance footage from the gym. The county coroner was not called to the scene until six hours after Johnson\u2019s body was found; under Georgia law he should have been notified immediately.\nThe family secured a judge\u2019s order to exhume the body so that a second autopsy could be performed. A private pathologist found haemorrhaging beneath the skin of Johnson\u2019s jaw and neck and concluded he suffered a fatal blow near his carotid artery that appeared to be \u201cnon-accidental\u201d. The second autopsy made another shocking discovery: Kendrick\u2019s internal organs were missing and paper had been stuffed into the cavities (the fate of the organs remains unknown). In October 2013 a federal criminal civil rights investigation was announced, leading to interviews with almost a hundred people, but the justice department closed the case in June 2016, saying investigators \u201cfound insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges\u201d. The Johnson family also pursued various civil lawsuits without success; they were even countersued and face potential legal costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u201cMy whole family is hurt because they treated us like we\u2019re the ones who have committed a crime and instead we\u2019re the victims,\u201d Jacquelyn reflects. \u201cWe\u2019re Kendrick\u2019s mother and father and family and friends, and they treated us like we\u2019ve committed a crime. It\u2019s hurtful and it\u2019s so wrong on so many levels.\u201d Brian and Branden Bell, white classmates of Kendrick, were reportedly considered persons of interest in the FBI investigation. The brothers were never charged and an FBI video analysis determined they were in different parts of the school when Kendrick went to the gym. (Their father, Rick Bell, was an FBI agent who resigned after his house was raided for evidence.) The brothers told investigators and the media that they did not see Kendrick on the day of his death. But the documentary dug up surveillance footage showing Kendrick standing about four feet from Brian Bell in a school hallway, as well as an unredacted FBI report that states: \u201cKendrick Johnson is observed in a covered walkway moving towards the camera. Bell is observed in the same location at this time.\u201d The Bell brothers deny any wrongdoing. The film\u2019s writer director, Jason Pollock, first met Jacquelyn when he was living in Ferguson, Missouri, during the uprising that followed the death of Michael Brown, a Black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white police officer (the subject of his film Stranger Fruit). After becoming Facebook friends with Jacquelyn, Pollock noticed graphic pictures of Kendrick\u2019s mutilated face cropping up daily in his feed.\nAs the film highlights, Jacquelyn\u2019s willingness to share the harrowing image of her son evokes Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, whose mother decided to have an open casket so the world could see what had been done to him. The killers were never brought to justice but the searing image was galvanising for the civil rights movement. Jacquelyn believes that someone first posted the image with malicious intent. \u201cI would never have shared no photo of him looking the way he looked \u2013 as a mother, it hurts me that you would see that picture \u2013 but I began to share that and remind the people this is what they did to my child.\u201d Moved and incensed, Pollock went on to spend four years researching Kendrick\u2019s death, determined to show that it is a burning injustice long overdue a fresh look. \u201cIf a white kid had been rolled up in the gym that day, I wouldn\u2019t have had to do this,\u201d he says by phone from California. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be talking right now because the system would have done its job and the system didn\u2019t do its job from day one. They wanted to make this look like it was an accident because they didn\u2019t want to do an investigation.\u201d Pollock continues: \u201cThe whole story is just Shakespearean, what they\u2019re going through, watching the state abuse them like this. The film doesn\u2019t come to a conclusion. We\u2019re not trying to support any conspiracy theories but we\u2019re just trying to show the facts that we\u2019re giving the light of day. \u201cI hope this piece of art puts a human face on the trauma as well as just gets the story out there. We don\u2019t know what happened. But this is a story we should be talking about because I do believe he is our generation\u2019s Emmett Till.\u201d The director, who started his career working for the documentarian Michael Moore, has become a fierce advocate for the family. \u201cWe are calling on President Biden and his team to review the malpractice at the FBI and the DoJ with the Kendrick Johnson case and unless Washington DC starts looking at this case, the state of Georgia is never going to deal with this. \u201cIf you want to clean up the act of our nation, you need to clean up this case because this is a really, really, really bad one and this family deserves way more from America than they\u2019ve gotten. If you care about Black Lives Matter issues, you need to take the Kendrick Johnson case on in Washington and deal with this.\u201d\nFinding Kendrick Johnson opens with whistleblower Mitch Credle, a 23-year veteran homicide detective with Washington police who investigated Johnson\u2019s death with the US attorney\u2019s office. He says by phone: \u201cI hope the film will wake up law enforcement as far as wanting to look at it again. What bothers me at this point is: who will look into it? \u201cNo one\u2019s going to really trust the local jurisdiction there to look into it because of, I guess, the bad feelings, the history. The federal government were recused from the situation. So I don\u2019t know who they will get to come in and look at it and just go based on the facts. \u201cDon\u2019t do it with any villains involved. Just go and investigate it based on the evidence, regardless of who the suspects are. Just start from A and investigate it the proper way. All the families ask for is just do things the proper way. That\u2019s all they want.\u201d Earlier this year Ashley Paulk, a county sheriff in Georgia, reopened the investigation into Kendrick\u2019s death, saying he was reviewing 17 boxes of evidence collected by federal agents that his office obtained from the US justice department. Jacqueline is sceptical of that effort but says: \u201cI remain hopeful. I\u2019m going to stay hopeful and I\u2019m going to stay prayerful that one day the truth will come out.\u201d The memory of Kendrick is with her constantly. But so is the manner of his death. If \u201cclosure\u201d, whatever that means, is even possible, it still eludes her. \u201cThere\u2019s no days of not thinking about him and the things that happened to him and how can people be so evil? This is eight years\u2019 worth of pain and it is\u2019s growing stronger and stronger every day. They say it gets easier, but it don\u2019t.\u201d Finding Kendrick Johnson is available to rent now in the US with a UK date to be announced", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/03/kendrick-johnson-documentary-emmett-till", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:00:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The BBC spy thriller, starring Comer as the psychopathic assassin Villanelle and Sandra Oh as British intelligence officer Eve Polastri, is approaching its fourth and final series. Speaking to Harper\u2019s Bazaar, the Liverpool-born actor, 28, admitted she tried to avoid thinking about the show\u2019s conclusion. Comer, who received the editor\u2019s choice award at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar women of the year awards on Tuesday, said: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about it too much, honestly. It\u2019s sad, you know? I\u2019ve been with this character for a really, really long time. \u201cI would rather we ended on a good note and kept our integrity, instead of going on and on, and being kicked out the door.\u201d Comer said there were many layers to Villanelle : \u201cShe\u2019s multifaceted and you can\u2019t really pin her down. She\u2019s instilled a sense of fearlessness in me. Through playing her, I\u2019ve had to shed my own self-consciousness. \u201cVillanelle\u2019s style is loud and a little bit mismatched. She dresses for herself, which I adore. I\u2019m happy when I\u2019m comfortable, I want to explore fashion but ultimately, I want to feel like myself. Villanelle would probably hate me.\u201d The actor said she hoped to appear in a science-fiction project and work with the French film director and screenwriter Julia Ducournau, who won the Palme d\u2019Or at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival. \u201cI\u2019d love to do some very grounded sci-fi and I really, really want to work with Julia Ducournau,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I love about her is that she clearly has such a distinct voice and her films are so unexpected.\u201d Killing Eve follows Oh\u2019s Polastri as she attempts to track down and arrest Comer\u2019s Villanelle, but as the pursuit unfolds the pair develop a mutual obsession with one another. In 2018, the first season set a record for BBC iPlayer when it notched up 10.8 million requests in seven days. This record was later beaten by the television adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People. Based on the Villanelle novel series by Luke Jennings, each series has been led by a different female head writer, with the first penned by the Fleabag creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Emerald Fennell was head writer for season two, Suzanne Heathcote worked on season three and the fourth and final series is led by Laura Neal, who previously worked on the Netflix comedy-drama series Sex Education.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/03/jodie-comer-killing-eve-should-end-on-a-high-and-not-go-on-and-on", "last_update": "2021-11-02T14:02:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},

But if you go back far enough, you reach a period where Earth was a very dull place. Nicknamed the \u201cBoring Billion\u201d, the period between 1850m and 850m years ago appears to have had hardly any plate tectonic movement, very little change in climate and a stalling of biological evolution. But was this period more interesting than we think? Geologists have been studying the geochemistry and makeup of continental rocks from the Boring Billion. The geochemistry suggests that the continental crust was hot and thin (40km or less) \u2013 not suitable for plate tectonics or building mountain ranges. But curiously the structure and composition of continental rocks indicate that crust did shimmy around and that low mountain ranges existed. The findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. Instead of the dodgem-car style of plate tectonics we have on Earth today, the Boring Billion seems to have been more like a waltz on a slippery dancefloor. This gentle form of plate tectonics has long since vanished, but understanding it may give us a clue as to how contemporary plate tectonics got started.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/03/terrawatch-earths-boring-plate-tectonics-period", "last_update": "2021-11-02T09:29:35Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Salma Hayek: \u2018Weinstein would scream at me, I didn\u2019t hire you to look ugly\u2019", "article": "Salma Hayek is dreadfully jetlagged, which is one of the perils of having homes around the world and frequently hopping between them. \u201cLet me tell you about my craziness,\u201d she says by video chat from her home in west London. \u201cI\u2019m here for less than a week, then I go back [to the US] for five days for my husband\u2019s work, then I come back here for my work, then I go back to LA because I\u2019m getting a star on the Hollywood Boulevard! It\u2019s crazy,\u201d she says. After this interview she has a fitting for dresses for various movie premieres. \u201cWe\u2019re just making it up as we go along!\u201d she says in exasperation at her crazy life. Despite the craziness, she looks impeccable in a Gucci dress (\u201cAs comfortable as your sweats!\u201d), framed by the enormous mirrored painting behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s by [Takashi] Murakami,\u201d she says casually of one of the most expensive living artists. She blows a kiss to her husband, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, as he leaves the house. Pinault is the CEO of the fashion conglomerate Kering, which is behind labels such as Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and many others. The Pinault family wealth is estimated at $49bn. It\u2019s crazy. Hayek could have easily opted for the cosy, cosseted life of a mega-rich housewife. And, to be honest, there are times when she does sound a bit like one. Her favourite outfits at the moment are Balenciaga dresses: \u201cI have four that I love,\u201d she says. Of course, it helps that her husband owns the brand. Is she allowed to wear brands that aren\u2019t owned by her husband? \u201cI\u2019m allowed to do whatever I want!\u201d she says with mock indignation, although she adds \u201cit\u2019s just easier to buy the [Kering] brands. They know me there.\u201d Yet, despite possessing a walk-in closet presumably as big as an average house, Hayek is not your average gazillionaire\u2019s wife. By the time she met Pinault, she was 39 and a famous actor with an Oscar nomination, for 2002\u2019s Frida. Plenty of actors before her had married wealthy men and then disappeared behind the fortress wall; Grace Kelly gave up her career to become the princess of Monaco, and Prince Rainier had a fraction of Pinault\u2019s money. But Hayek, 55, was never going to do that. \u201cI love what I do,\u201d she says when I ask what motivates her to work. Plus, she says, she pays for her own expenses in her marriage: \u201cSometimes I struggle because I have a lot of expenses, but I like that sensation. It keeps me real,\u201d she says solemnly. (Mind you, Hayek\u2019s \u201creal\u201d is the bank balance of a Hollywood star.) This month alone, she stars in two films: the latest Marvel megamovie, Eternals, and House of Gucci, the biopic of the Gucci family. I\u2019ve only been allowed to see Eternals, and it\u2019s undeniably pleasing to see a female superhero older than 21 \u2013 and a deaf one, a gay one, an Asian one and a black one \u2013 among the seemingly endless Eternals heroes. That casting \u201cfeels like a miracle\u201d, she laughs. \u201cIt has to start somewhere, and I\u2019m glad it starts with me!\u201d But good intentions can\u2019t disguise that the script is a load of hooey (the Guardian gave the film two stars). I ask Hayek if she agreed to star in it because it was directed by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, who won an Oscar last year for Nomadland, given she has long been a vocal supporter of female directors. \u201cYes, absolutely. I was in awe of her every second I was with her,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I am working with a Chinese female director,\u2019 and there\u2019s a satisfaction in that that\u2019s bigger than the film: it\u2019s watching another woman be so brave, be so clever, be so inspiring.\u201d\nEternals is Hayek\u2019s first superhero movie \u2013 \u201cAnd I found it fascinating!\u201d I ask why she thinks superhero movies are so popular now, but instead of making the usual economic arguments (eg they\u2019re easier to sell to Chinese audiences than American dramas), she makes a very Hayek one: \u201cI have a strange theory about it. It\u2019s out there, so get ready: I think that because we only use from 3% to 10% of our brain, we know there\u2019s a lot more to a human being that we have not discovered. So I think the superhero story makes us wonder if there\u2019s more that we can do. That\u2019s what they do to me anyway.\u201d By her usual charismatic standards, Hayek is a little flat today because of the jetlag. But she warms up on subjects she cares about, so we talk a bit about Frida, her true labour of love, which she spent eight years getting made. But this, alas, leads to a subject she\u2019s a little less fond of: Harvey Weinstein, who produced it. In 2017, Hayek wrote a blistering piece for the New York Times, detailing how he sexually harassed her for years, and how she kept saying no: \u201cNo to me taking a shower with him. No to letting him watch me take a shower. No to letting him give me a massage. No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage. No to letting him give me oral sex. No to my getting naked with another woman. No no no no no \u2026 And with every refusal came Harvey\u2019s Machiavellian rage.\u201d Hayek, understandably, isn\u2019t super-excited about rehashing this particular part of her history: \u201cIt\u2019s so boring and old!\u201d she groans. But when I tell her that Weinstein bullied me, got me banned from restaurants and parties and even wrote an article about me because he didn\u2019t like things I\u2019d written, she perks right up. \u201cNow I want to interview you! Now, this is an interesting conversation because, if you really look at my piece, you\u2019ll see that I really focused on the bullying [rather than the sexual harassment], and I do think women got it worse [from him].\u201d Weinstein \u201cis not the only man to reassure himself by knowing he can destroy women,\u201d she says. I ask if she normalised his bullying as a way to cope with it. \u201cTo a degree. And I did feel all right [when he bullied me]. OK, I would shake [afterwards] and it did depress me, but there was a cartoon aspect about the whole thing. When he would call me up [during the making of Frida] and scream, \u2018Why do you have a [monobrow] and moustache? I didn\u2019t hire you to look ugly!\u2019 I was like, \u2018But didn\u2019t you ever look at a picture of Frida Kahlo?\u2019 If a man was playing Cyrano de Bergerac, he wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018What\u2019s with the nose?\u2019\u201d I start to ask about her claim in the article that she thinks the reason Weinstein never assaulted her was that she was friends with Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney, but she interrupts me. \u201cAlso I was very strong,\u201d she says pointedly. This sounds a little like she\u2019s suggesting some of Weinstein\u2019s victims could be seen as weak, which seems unlikely from a woman who has done so much activism on behalf of women. So I ask if she just means she said no. \u201cI didn\u2019t just say no. I\u2019m a force to be recognised,\u201d she stresses again. \u201cHe never saw me weak. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not afraid, but you\u2019re not going to see it. I can be almost intimidating in my calm strength, you know?\u201d When did she learn to control her fear?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe animals. I have a lot of animals and I know that it\u2019s very important they don\u2019t smell the fear. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d By the way, she says, Weinstein was \u201cnot the first or last one\u201d who treated her like that. In Hollywood or in general? \u201cIn general! We\u2019re girls! \u2026 So you learn to be brave. It\u2019s not easy, but you have to.\u201d Are there men who bullied or harassed her who are still working in Hollywood? \u201cI\u2019m sure \u2013 it was systematic. But one of my strengths is I don\u2019t hold a grudge,\u201d she says, and then adds, \u201cI also believe people can change \u2026 I\u2019m not interested in shaming anyone. I just want it to stop.\u201d Hayek was born and raised in Mexico, and I ask what constituted a worse problem for her in Hollywood: the harassment or the racism. \u201cWell, it comes hand in hand. When they disrespect your background, they feel you\u2019re weaker and they prey on weakness,\u201d she says. A few years ago, Hayek revealed in an interview with the Guardian that the director Ivan Reitman wouldn\u2019t even let her audition for the lead of a film because the part \u201cwasn\u2019t written Latin\u201d. Which movie was that? \u201cUmmm, the leading man was, um, Indiana Jones?\u201d Harrison Ford? \u201cYes! Harrison Ford! The woman was supposed to work in the fashion business and, ironically, [Reitman] thought it wouldn\u2019t be believable for me. It was Six Days, Seven Nights and Anne Heche got the part. And then she came out! Just before the movie was released! And they thought I wouldn\u2019t be believable [in a romance with Ford]!\u201d she hoots. Did she lose many parts because of her ethnicity? \u201cSo many! I\u2019m not going to name names, but there was one part written for me, for a Mexican, and it was played by not even a Latina,\u201d she says. And yet she was criticised for playing a Puerto Rican character on 30 Rock, I say. \u201cAhhh, it\u2019s complicated because they wrote that for me. Probably if I had not done that, [that character] would not have happened. As an actress, I want to play a Puerto Rican, I want to play a Colombian, I want to play a Martian! As an actress, that is what it\u2019s supposed to be. On the other hand, it\u2019s good to give people opportunities. But there has to be a balance, because if we restrain people too much, everyone is going to be afraid to do anything: \u2018You need a name because you need to promote the thing: oh, it\u2019s too complicated, let\u2019s just get a white girl.\u2019 So we need to be realistic and to strike a balance. I\u2019m not black and white about this, or about anything.\u201d\nHayek grew up in a wealthy family in Mexico, the daughter of an oil executive and an opera singer. She became hugely famous in her own country at the age of 23 when she starred in a telenovela and slowly broke into Hollywood when Rodriguez cast her in Desperado opposite Antonio Banderas. Soon after, she founded her own production company, through which she would make Ugly Betty and Frida, the film that really confirmed her as a star. From early on, she was an activist for helping women, including testifying to the US Senate to reauthorise the Violence Against Women Act and donating to women\u2019s shelters. She also bought a ranch, which she uses as an animal sanctuary. For a long time, she assumed she would just live as a single woman with her animals, but then she met Pinault, through their mutual friend, the late designer L\u2019Wren Scott. They have a 14-year-old daughter. Trying not to channel Mrs Merton too much, I ask what first appealed to her about mega-billionaire Pinault. \u201cHe\u2019s like no one I ever met before,\u201d she says, clearly relishing the subject. \u201cHe\u2019s a fascinating man and it\u2019s been 16 years and I\u2019m still fascinated by him. I\u2019d met amazing men, but I don\u2019t know if anybody saw me as clearly as him. And I know who he is. Something about his soul, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it\u2019s pure.\u201d During lockdown, Hayek got dangerously ill with Covid, but refused to go to hospital, preferring to stay home. \u201cIt was terrifying. But it was also kind of lovely to be in the house with him, who is my rock,\u201d she says. She was 41 when their daughter, Valentina, was born and I ask what the upsides are to being an older mother. \u201cYou appreciate it so much more because, by the time you get there, you\u2019ve been through the fear of maybe it might never happen. Also you know what you want to do with your life, so you don\u2019t have the pressure of: \u2018What am I going to do with my life? And I\u2019m a mother!\u2019 When you marry young, it\u2019s hard because maybe you don\u2019t know who you are yet. I was a little bit wiser,\u201d she says. And as she heads off for more fittings for her upcoming premieres, Murakami twinkling over her shoulder, who would disagree? Eternals is in cinemas from 5 November. House of Gucci is released on 26 November.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/03/salma-hayek-weinstein-would-scream-at-me-i-didnt-hire-you-to-look-ugly", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:32:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "UK business rates review may tax streaming services and online goods", "article": "Streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, online newspapers, ebooks and items reserved online but picked up in stores could be subject to a new online sales tax if ministers give it the green light. In a long-anticipated final report on a review of business rates the Treasury said it would shortly launch a consultation on a new tax for online goods and services which was expected to conclude next year. Should an online sales tax be pursued, the report said \u201cdesign choices\u201d would need to be made on what should be taxable, including digital products, sales agreed via email or instant message, and essentials such as most foods, medicines and children\u2019s clothes, which currently do not attract VAT. But the consultation added that it was likely any extra cost of such a tax would be passed on to consumers at a high rate, suggesting it would be \u201cregressive\u201d \u2013 or borne more heavily by low-income households. Publication of the detailed review comes after the government announced at the budget last week it would \u201cexplore the arguments for and against\u201d an online sales tax that could fund a reduction in business rates for high street retailers. The report said a new tax set at 1% to 2% would not raise enough money to replace business rates, but could \u201chelp to rebalance the tax burden between bricks and mortar shops and online retail\u201d. Despite widespread calls from the retail and hospitality industries, who partly blame hefty business rates bills for mass closures on the British high street, the report said there was no case for a fundamental revamp of the property tax which brings in \u00a325bn a year. The government review said: \u201cThe evidence provided has not established that the business rates system is responsible for the shift to online or for broader problems on the high street. Other factors that may be relevant include changing consumer preferences, improvement in the choice and convenience available to online shoppers, and differences in the amount of stock that physical stores carry as compared with online retailers.\u201d Store owners say they are disadvantaged by paying higher taxes than online specialists such as Amazon, Boohoo and Asos who divert shoppers away from local thoroughfares. Labour last month pledged to scrap business rates and undertake the \u201cbiggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation\u201d if it was voted in at the next election.\nIn his budget speech last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would help small retail and hospitality businesses with a temporary 50% cut. However, industry groups said the cut, which is capped at \u00a3110,000 per business and will last a year, would only benefit small retailers, bars and restaurants and pubs, because larger shops such as a single department store can pay more than \u00a31m a year in rates.

{"title": "Cop26 has to be about keeping fossil fuels in the ground. All else is distraction | George Monbiot", "article": "In some respects, preventing climate breakdown is highly complicated. But in another, it\u2019s really simple: we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground. All the bluster and grandstanding, the extravagant promises and detailed mechanisms discussed in Glasgow this week amount to nothing if this simple and obvious thing doesn\u2019t happen. A recent study in the scientific journal Nature suggests that to stand a 50% chance of avoiding more than 1.5C of global heating, we need to retire 89% of proven coal reserves, 58% of oil reserves and 59% of fossil methane (\u201cnatural gas\u201d) reserves. If we want better odds than 50-50, we\u2019ll need to leave almost all of them untouched. Yet most governments with major reserves are determined to make the wrong choice. As the latest production gap report by the UN and academic researchers shows, over the next two decades, unless there\u2019s a rapid and drastic change in policy, coal is likely to decline a little, but oil and gas production will keep growing. By 2030, governments are planning to extract 110% more fossil fuels than their Paris agreement pledge (\u201climit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels\u201d) would permit. Even nations that claim to be leading the transition mean to keep drilling. In the US, Joe Biden promised to pause all new leases for oil and gas on public lands and in offshore waters. His government was sued by 14 Republican states. Though climate campaigners argue that Biden has many other tools for preventing such leases from being issued, he immediately folded, and his government has now begun the process of auctioning drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s just the kind of weakness the Republicans were hoping to exploit. Germany has promised to phase out coal production by 2038 (far too late, by the way). Yet it is still developing new deposits. For example, the village of L\u00fctzerath in North Rhine-Westphalia, which sits above a thick seam of the filthiest kind of coal \u2013 lignite \u2013 is currently being destroyed. But if Germany abides by its own rule, the mine will need to be abandoned before it reaches full production. So either homes and forests are being trashed for no reason, or the German government doesn\u2019t intend to honour its promise. In the UK, the government still insists on what it calls \u201cmaximising economic recovery\u201d of oil and gas. Last year, it offered 113 new licences to explore offshore reserves. It aims at least to double the amount of fossil fuels that are ready to be exploited here. Every speech and pledge and gesture at Glasgow this week is thistledown, by comparison to the hard facts of new coalmines, oil and gas fields. It\u2019s the mining and drilling that counts: the rest is distraction. But distraction is big business. The oil corporations have spent many millions of dollars on ads, memes and films to convince us they\u2019ve gone green. But the latest report on this issue by the International Energy Agency reveals that in 2020 \u201cclean energy investments by the oil and gas industry accounted for only around 1% of total capital expenditure\u201d. Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world\u2019s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8tn into fossil fuel companies. People in rich nations seek to blame climate breakdown on India and China, which continue to develop new coal plants. But an estimated 40% of the \u201ccommitted emissions\u201d for the Asian coal plants sampled by researchers can be attributed to banks and investors in Europe and the US. Even if guilt were to be apportioned by nationality \u2013 a preposterous notion in a world where money moves freely and power is wielded across borders \u2013 we could not detach ourselves from these decisions. There\u2019s scarcely a fossil fuel project on Earth that has not been facilitated by public money. In 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund, governments spent $450bn in direct subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. The IMF accounts the other costs the industry imposes on us \u2013 pollution, destruction and climate chaos \u2013 at $5.5tn. But I find such figures meaningless: dollars can\u2019t capture the loss of human life and the trashing of ecosystems, let alone the prospect of systemic environmental collapse. One in five of all deaths, according to a recent estimate, are now caused by fossil fuel pollution. Public finance corporations are still pouring money into coal, oil and gas: in the past three years, G20 governments and multinational development banks outrageously spent two and a half times as much money on international finance for fossil fuels as they did on renewables. On one account, 93% of the world\u2019s coal plants are protected from market forces by special government contracts and uncompetitive tariffs. The UK has reduced its petroleum revenue tax for companies drilling for oil to zero. As a result, our oilfields are likely soon to cost the exchequer more money than it gains. What\u2019s the point? For just $161bn \u2013 a fraction of the money governments spend on supporting fossil fuels \u2013 they could buy out and shut down every coal plant on Earth. If they did so as part of a just transition, they would create more employment than they destroy. For example, research by Oil Change International suggests the UK could generate three jobs in clean energy for every one lost from oil and gas. Everything about the relationship between nation states and the fossil fuel industry is perverse, stupid and self-destructive. For the sake of this dirty industry\u2019s profits and dividends \u2013 overwhelmingly concentrated among a tiny number of the world\u2019s people \u2013 governments commit us to catastrophe. All over the world, people are mobilising to change this, and their voices need to be heard in Glasgow. The campaign to create a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty has gathered the signatures of thousands of scientists and more than 100 Nobel laureates. Europe Beyond Coal is bringing together movements across the continent to stop new mines and close existing ones. The visionary governments of Denmark and Costa Rica have founded the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. We should pressure our governments to join it. And yes, it really is this simple. We have the technology required to replace fossil fuels. There\u2019s plenty of money, which is currently being squandered on the destruction of life on Earth. The transition could take place in months, if governments willed it. The only thing that stands in the way is the power of legacy industries and the people who profit from them. This is what needs to be overthrown. The handwaving, the complexity, the grandiloquent distraction in Glasgow are designed above all for one purpose: not to accelerate this transition, but to thwart it.

{"title": "\u2018The bikini line is still a no-no\u2019: why does dance have a problem with body hair?", "article": "The ideal dancer\u2019s body is unrealistic in many ways: bendier than a Barbie, incredibly lean but super-strong, with very particular proportions (in ballet, small head, long legs, short torso, high insteps). And also, it\u2019s hairless. As with swimmers, athletes, gymnasts and others who wear leotards for a living, constant depilation is part of the job. That goes for men as well as women. \u201cI choose to shave because it gives me a sense of readiness,\u201d says dancer and choreographer Eliot Smith. \u201cI believe it gives me better outlines of the body against the stage lights.\u201d On ballet message boards, it\u2019s not uncommon to find parents of teenage boys asking what to do about hairy legs showing under white tights (wear two pairs of tights, or paint over hairs with pancake are two suggestions, if shaving isn\u2019t an option). But is there an alternative? When pole dancer Leila Davis was pictured in an Adidas campaign in March showing off armpit fuzz, as well as toned abs, there were plenty of online haters, predictably, but lots of lovers, too. And there are a few \u2013 although not many \u2013 contemporary dancers who are happy to let their body hair be seen on stage. \u201cI want it to be normalised,\u201d says Jessie Roberts-Smith, a performer with Scottish Dance Theatre. And independent choreographer Ellie Sikorski sees it as part of a bigger picture. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first fight I would pick about the homogeneity of bodies on stage,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s something archaic in dance \u2013 where your body is policed in certain ways. You\u2019re taught not to have agency over your body and body hair is a tiny detail of that.\u201d\nIn ballet, land of smooth, clean lines and impossible perfection, it\u2019s hard to imagine unkempt hairs sprouting up on stage any time soon. \u201cIn classical ballet you\u2019re never going to see a beautiful tutu princess with loads of armpit hair,\u201d laughs Nancy Osbaldeston, a principal with Ballet Vlaanderen in Antwerp, who fits in leg shaving and Brazilian waxes around her performance schedule. She recently danced Palmos, a ballet of bare legs and high-cut leotards by Andonis Foniadakis. \u201cThere were definitely some crotchy moments,\u201d she recalls.\nIn fact, Osbaldeston thinks hair removal is so much part of the job that dancers might be able to claim it as an expense. \u201cI think someone did tell me that if you have a good accountant to do your taxes, you can write it off,\u201d she says. When Osbaldeston danced with English National Ballet, she remembers a woman coming in once and waxing everyone in turn as a job lot. Bego\u00f1a Cao, winner of a National Dance award, had a similar experience. \u201cWe\u2019d put a mat down and lock the door.\u201d Laser removal is popular as well. \u201cI like to be tidy,\u201d adds Cao. \u201cThe thought never crossed my mind to not take it off. If you have a tutu on, the audience from further out can\u2019t see anything. But you\u2019ve got your colleagues and people in the wings and those ballet fanatics that have their binoculars!\u201d\nOutside ballet, though, there are some hairs peeking through, in line with a wider cultural shift among Gen Z-ers happy to show off their armpits au naturel on Instagram, or even dye their body hair. And then there\u2019s the beauty brand Billie, which advertises razors with pictures of models and their proudly furry bikini lines. \u201cI do feel like we\u2019re getting more into a world where both are normal,\u201d says Roberts-Smith, who is 26 and leaves her hair as it is, which is fine by Scottish Dance Theatre. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about it any more. I\u2019m lucky to be in a company that embraces different shapes and sizes and hairless and hairy. It needs to be happening. For me, it is one of the most profound inequalities between men and women, that we have been removing parts of ourselves for such a long time, and that\u2019s just deemed normal by society. It\u2019s bonkers when you think about it, absolutely bananas.\u201d Obviously, men do shave their faces, but it\u2019s the sense of disgust attached to women\u2019s hair that\u2019s so gendered. \u201cThere\u2019s all this deep-seated stuff about cleanliness, which just isn\u2019t true,\u201d says Roberts-Smith. Sikorski, 33, stopped shaving her legs at 17. \u201cBecause, I suppose, I discovered that was possible,\u201d she says, and because shaving irritated her skin. She\u2019s more likely to get a reaction now on the tube than on stage \u2013 she\u2019s had people take pictures of her when she\u2019s been holding on to an overhead support. There\u2019s a hierarchy of hirsuteness, though. Sikorski remembers that, in one of the first pieces she made, she wore a swimming costume. \u201cI had hairy legs, hairy armpits, but I plucked my bikini line.\u201d \u201cI think the bikini line is still a no-no,\u201d says Robert-Smith, with regard to the move towards letting it all hang out \u2013 although she has a leotard piece coming up and isn\u2019t planning to buy any Veet.\nThere are plenty more hair-related issues \u2013 most seriously, the dancers with afro hair who are told flat-out that it\u2019s not appropriate for ballet. French dancer Marie-Astrid Mence talked about this in the film Pointe Black last year. The vagaries of personal grooming may seem trifling by contrast. But the discrimination against afro hair is changing, according to Northern Ballet\u2019s dancer Aerys Merrill, who\u2019s heard those stories, but hasn\u2019t experienced negative comments about her own afro hair. In the US, she danced Clara in The Nutcracker with her natural hair proudly on show. \u201cSome companies are more accepting; some companies want it to be extremely uniform, with the same slicked-back look,\u201d she says. Like Merrill, 17-year-old Ta\u00efs Vinolo, who appeared in Amazon\u2019s The Show Must Go On advert last Christmas, used to straighten her hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my own hair until two or three years ago,\u201d she says. Now she\u2019s wondering if we\u2019ll see ballet dancers with braided hair on stage. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m pretty sure we are close to it,\u201d she says, but adds that as a young pre-professional dancer, \u201cI am scared to approach that subject with my teachers.\u201d\nSome choreographers actively incorporate (head) hair into their choreography, Pina Bausch being the queen of long flowing locks, whether swooping around the dancer like an extra limb in 2006\u2019s Vollmond or being used to whip the cruel Bluebeard in her 1977 version of the folk tale. Osbaldeston says she missed out on being cast once because she had short hair and the choreographer wanted it long and swishy. Choreographers have a vision in mind \u2013 and that includes facial hair. Sikorski knows of a male dancer who has lost jobs because he won\u2019t shave his beard off. Smith has become more relaxed about his own facial hair, he tells me, in line with a general shift across the industry that includes dancers having visible tattoos. As an artistic director he has an open mind, he says, but expects the dancers to look \u201cpresentable\u201d and be open to what\u2019s needed for a particular character. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a question of whether ballet is a personal expression or whether a choreographer has the final say over how you look,\u201d says dancer James Forbat who, incidentally, shaves his chest and leg hair out of choice for performances, but has never explicitly been asked to.\nSikorski raises a similar point. Do you see a body as an abstract tool to create visual art, or a person who can\u2019t be separated from what they\u2019re doing? \u201cPeople think you can abstract a body, and I fundamentally think you can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where I differ with a lot of people in the dance world.\u201d All these dancers agree on one thing, though: each to their own, everyone\u2019s personal choice should be respected. But the decision to shave and wax, or wear your hair straightened or natural, inevitably reflects the values of their art forms as well as the wider culture at large. Osbaldeston doesn\u2019t think any of her female colleagues will stop shaving their armpits soon. \u201cI would feel bad for partnering, if a boy was holding you under your arms,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they have hair there too,\u201d she muses, \u201cso I don\u2019t know the difference really.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/03/bikini-line-dance-problem-body-hair-chests-armpits-legs-waxed-diverse-performers", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:04:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "What are the elements in your iPhone, Starbucks cup and bike? Visualized", "article": "What happens if you reverse engineer the raw materials of everyday objects such as an iPhone, a Starbucks cup or a bicycle? Lonneke Gordijn and Ralph Nauta of the Dutch art collective Studio Drift attempted to find out by stripping back the elements and depicting them proportionately in cubes and prisms. Titled Materialism, their show at the New York event space the Shed asks viewers to put aside culturally constructed ideas of various chemicals and view the objects with a renewed sense of wonder. Materialism is presented within another show, Fragile Future, that is equally enamored with the material world, finding a certain grace in enormous blocks of concrete. Fragile Future\u2019s five minivan-sized concrete blocks (\u201cDrifters\u201d) appear to float through the air, rotating and performing feats of choreography that start out free-form before tracing specific shapes around the viewer. It\u2019s set to music composed by Anohni, an artist long preoccupied by questions of human ecology. Nauta describes the pieces in Materialism as \u201cdeconstructions of everyday objects that we find interesting\u201d. By nudging us to remember that iPhones contain elements like nickel that are environmentally destructive to mine \u2013 along with trace quantities of cobalt and tungsten, which have been linked to conflict mining \u2013 Studio Drift wants us to realize the connections between consumer goods and the societies that create them. In a less world-historical sense, phones themselves have changed a great deal. Comparing the components of an iPhone 4S with those in a now obsolete Nokia 3210, Nauta observes that the shift has been enormous in barely 20 years. The Nokia\u2019s main component is the circuitry of an actual telephone, whereas with iPhones, the biggest chunk is specially developed glass.\nThe iPhone 4S is made of specially developed glass along with steel, polycarbonate, graphite, copper, nickel, and a range of other materials.\nThe Nokia 3210 includes polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, nylon and aluminum. Its main component is the circuitry of an actual telephone. \u201cAt first, the function was more important,\u201d Nauta says of early-aughts phones. \u201cThe screen was minimal. The connection was more important, but now it\u2019s the visual connection. There are a lot of details: the cobalt, the mercury, the nickel, which comes from certain mines. We\u2019re going deeper into that for our next project, putting in an augmented layer where you can actually dive into the object and find more about the materials.\u201d\nA Nokia 3210. Apple claims to have phased out mercury in its products in 2009, but in Materialism\u2019s breakdown of a Nokia \u2013 a company that once attempted to manufacture a tablet called Mercury \u2013 a spongy, kelly-green prism jumps out from the mostly transparent or grayscale. In this context, it looks eerie, almost radioactive. The show\u2019s spookiest piece might be the Internet, a single, dark-gray block. It\u2019s silicon, Nauta says. Using the time-honored principle of E = MC2, he calculated the weight of all the electrons running through the internet on a specific date in 2020. The total? About 60kg, up from 25 grams not so long before. Many of these prisms are representations of the materials, not the materials themselves. This owes less to toxicity than to the fussy properties of some materials at room temperature, or their cost.\nThe internet of 2020 is represented by a large block indicating the weight of all the electrons running through it, with a much smaller block showing how it appeared in 2000. Nauta says the ratios on display are more important. Take the Big Mac Menu, for example. \u201cWe kept it recognizable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could have gone to a molecular level, but with this, we thought you can still point out the fries, the sugar, the salt, the saturated fats, the pickle, the straw. It\u2019s interesting, because people do recognize it and get all of the blocks correct. So we have a logic in our minds that sees this hamburger and understands the size of the block that should be for the pickle, which I find fascinating.\u201d\nThe Big Mac Menu features water, bread, fries, Coke, fat, meat and other ingredients that \u2018people do recognize\u2019, Nauta says. Like the human body itself, the Starbucks Cup is mostly water. Nauta says that when he pays $5 for a cup of tea, he feels like someone screwed him over, but when he gets coffee with milk in it, he feels like it\u2019s worth it. (\u201cBut it\u2019s the same amount of water you\u2019re buying!\u201d he says.)\nThe Starbucks Cup is mostly water, but also contains paper, coffee, wood and polystyrene. Once deconstructed, this poses all sorts of questions about how arbitrary human economics can be, from quirks of the human palate to the fact that the global coffee industry appears consumed with questions of fair-labor practices far more than tea is. The more processed an item is, the harder it becomes for our minds to process.\nAn AK-47. Geopolitics shows up in several pieces, namely the M16 and the AK-47. The AK-47, one of the best-known Soviet exports, has become a totem of rightwing American ideas of liberty \u2013 it\u2019s a sort of cold war narrative in miniature. This humble Kalashnikov, Nauta says, is a $500 tool whose bullets are steel. By contrast, the M16 is practically a luxury good.\nThe AK-47 consists of birch wood, steel, paint and other materials, while the bullet contains steel, smokeless powder, lead and more \u2013 as compared with the high-grade polymer and nickel bullets of the M16, Nauta says. \u201cThe AK is made with wood, but in the States, it\u2019s this high-grade polymer that\u2019s specifically developed for the M16 that makes these weapons tens of thousands of dollars, and the bullets are made out of nickel,\u201d he says. \u201cThese different war machines \u2013 why do they function in a certain way?\u201d Then there\u2019s the Bike, as much a symbol of the Netherlands as the tulip. Unlike the smartphone, it\u2019s something most people can dismantle and fix in their garage. And yet even an analog technology can, when reduced to its essence, renew a sense of wonder.\nThe bike, which, unlike the smartphone, is something people can dismantle themselves, is made of rubber, polyurethane foam, steel, aluminum and other materials. \u201cWhen it rains here, or it\u2019s -15C here, everyone\u2019s still on their bike,\u201d Nauta says. \u201cEverybody knows how to repair their tire or put a chain back on their bike. In Amsterdam, you go through three a year, and it becomes this piece of mechanics that\u2019s just a part of your life. Still, all these things that you collect, it\u2019s impossible to process.

{"title": "NHS test-and-trace contractor cuts guaranteed pay by one-third", "article": "NHS mobile test-and-trace units run by Mitie are cutting the guaranteed pay of workers by a third after winning a new contract from the government. The outsourcing firm, which employs about 1,000 people at mobile testing sites, has told workers that from 8 November they will be guaranteed pay for an eight-hour shift each day, rather than 12 hours, slashing secure pay to \u00a380 a day from \u00a3120. Workers previously received the \u00a3120 no matter how many hours they worked, they will now receive extra pay only if they work more than eight hours. Workers said the pay change came amid a surge in demand for their services with some sites dealing with more than 600 people in a day. One worker said some supervisors were so busy they did not have time for the regulation half-hour break.\nAnother said the mobile test-and-trace workers had suffered \u201ca huge blow to morale\u201d because of the pay changes that are hitting shortly before Christmas. \u201cPersonally, I feel betrayed and seen as disposable by Mitie. The changes mean that everyone will be losing hundreds of pounds in earnings each month, with those who live the closest to and furthest from our sites losing significantly more with the new mileage proposals. \u201cThe bumbling way Mitie have handed this and their poor communication to employees is just shocking,\u201d the worker said. The latest cuts come after fellow mobile test-and-trace operator G4S cut the pay of some workers by up to 5% in the light of a new government contract that specifies they should receive the real living wage. Some G4S workers were told their hourly pay rate would drop from \u00a310 to a maximum of \u00a39.50 outside London, a cut of 5%. Those in London will drop from a maximum \u00a311 an hour to \u00a310.85, a 1.4% cut.\nMitie said there were no standard shift timings for mobile-testing units and the hours could change depending on a range of factors including location and weather. It said workers would be paid for the time from when the mobile unit left its base location until it returned. They will also now receive payment towards travel expenses \u2013 of 45p per mile from the testing base \u2013 as well as expenses such as parking fees as set out by the government. It said that previously these costs were factored into the workers\u2019 daily rate. A Mitie spokesperson, said: \u201cWe are introducing new procedures to ensure a consistent and fair approach to the payment terms for all colleagues working at mobile-testing units. \u201cThese changes better reflect the average shift length while still ensuring that colleagues are paid for any additional time they work, as well as for their business mileage and other associated driving expenses.\u201d Mitie said it had been directed to pay travel expenses by the government. The UK Health Security Agency, which was set up this year to replace Public Health England in the handling of public health protection and dealing with infectious diseases, is understood to be reviewing its position on travel expenses and the terms of payments have yet to be agreed with all operators. G4S did not respond directly when asked if it was planning to pay travel expenses for its workers. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe terms and conditions of our team members will remain in accordance with government guidelines and our contractual requirements, as it has been at all times throughout the delivery of this important contract.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/nhs-test-and-trace-contractor-cuts-guaranteed-pay-by-one-third", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:31:07Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Walrus leaves Arctic comfort zone for snooze on Dutch submarine", "article": "The disruption from the climate emergency being experienced by marine wildlife reached a new high in the first week of Cop26, when a female walrus was discovered sleeping on a submarine in a naval base in North Holland. Walruses normally live in the polar regions \u2013 several hundred miles north. This particular animal is one of at least two of the species that have been seen far from their Arctic habitat. Another wandering walrus, seen off the Scilly Islands, France, Spain and West Cork, Ireland, has since been sighted back in Icelandic waters. Freya, as the animal has been named, is the first of her species to visit the Netherlands in 23 years. She was spotted snoozing on a submarine in the naval port of Den Helder by Jeroen Hoekendijk, a Dutch scientist specialising in marine mammals.\nShe appears to be in good health, although Hoekendijk \u2013 who observed the animal feeding on razor clams earlier \u2013 noted a raw wound in her front flippers. She is thought to have swum south, following the Danish and German coasts. (Suggestions that she or the \u2018Irish\u2019 walrus might have been cast adrift on a broken ice floe were widely ridiculed by marine scientists.) Hoekendijk was instructed that he wasn\u2019t allowed to board the vessel to photograph the animal, only to be told; \u2018But you can walk on it.\u2019 He also noted that the vessel happens to be a \u2018Walrus-class submarine\u2019 \u2013 and is named Zr. Ms. Dolfijn. Social media users quipped that the Arctic mammal showed an \u201cexcellent example of animal-initiated civil resistance\u201d, and that \u201cconsidering military are huge contributors to carbon emissions, the walrus is probably protesting climate justice\u201d. Others, however, thought it was very nice of the Dutch navy not to kick the walrus off their boat.\nBut walruses are not just recent visitors to these southern waters. In 1456, William Caxton, the medieval chronicler and printer, recorded a walrus in the Thames (along with a swordfish and 20 whales). Caxton warned that the beast\u2019s appearance was a sign of trouble to come. Although that might have been for the walruses themselves, since they were slaughtered for their thick hide, which was made into ropes, and for their tusks, which were carved into ivory objects such as the famous Lewis chess pieces. And five hundred years ago this year, in 1521, the Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a great chronicler of the natural world, drew perhaps the first modern image of a walrus, said to have been stranded in \u2018Netherlandish waters\u2019. The sepia drawing goes on show in a major exhibition of D\u00fcrer\u2019s work at the National Gallery in London later this month.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/walrus-leaves-arctic-comfort-zone-for-snooze-on-dutch-submarine", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:46:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018A continuation of colonialism\u2019: indigenous activists say their voices are missing at Cop26 ", "article": "As world leaders inside the Cop26 conference centre in Glasgow boasted about pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions and end deforestation, indigenous delegates gathered across the river Clyde to commemorate activists killed for trying to protect the planet from corporate greed and government inaction. At least 1,005 environmental and land rights defenders have been murdered since the Paris accords were signed six years ago, according to the international non-profit Global Witness. One in three of those killed were indigenous people. The dead include Berta C\u00e1ceres, winner of the prestigious Goldman prize for environmental defenders, who was shot dead at her home in Honduras in March 2016 for opposing the construction of an internationally financed dam on a river considered sacred by her Lenca people. As the names of the murdered defenders were projected on a large outdoor screen, indigenous activists from Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and the Philippines implored political leaders to listen to their struggles. \u201cThe Cop is a big business, a continuation of colonialism where people come not to listen to us, but to make money from our land and natural resources,\u201d said Ita Mendoza, 46, an indigenous land defender from the Mixteca region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, attending Cop for the first time. \u201cWhat benefits does the Cop bring when more than a thousand people fighting to keep the planet alive have been killed [since Paris]?\u201d Mendoza is part of the Futuros Indigenas (Indigenous Futures) collective from Mexico, who spent months crowdfunding to be able to attend Cop26 so their communities\u2019 struggles and vision for protecting the planet might be heard. The collective did not get accreditation for the full two weeks, and as Cop first-timers are struggling to navigate the bureaucracy and structural barriers to their participation.\nStill, at least they made it. About two-thirds of civil society organizations who usually attend Cop could not come to Glasgow due to a combination of visa and accreditation problems, lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines and changing travel rules. Mostly absent are those from the global south \u2013 poorer, less industrialized nations who have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions but are disproportionately harmed by increasingly intense extreme weather events linked to global heating such as drought, storms and floods. Their voices will be missed during the negotiations, but the problems run much deeper, according to multiple veteran Cop participants. In the 50 years since Cop began, international climate policies have mostly ignored or violated the cultural and territorial rights of indigenous peoples \u2013 despite them being recognized in 2001 as a formal constituency, one of nine broad thematic clusters (that also include business groups, environmental NGOs, women and youth groups and trade unions) permitted to observe and lobby negotiators.\nThen in 2015, the Paris accords legally recognized the crucial role of traditional knowledge and innovations by local communities and indigenous peoples in understanding and tackling the climate crisis. The move was meant to ensure they could participate and influence international climate policies in a more meaningful and equal way. But six years on, indigenous people interviewed by the Guardian say little has changed inside the UN-led negotiations, while outside environmental destruction continues unchecked in their communities and the impact of the climate crisis is getting worse. \u201cIndigenous people are more visible but we\u2019re not taken any more seriously; we\u2019re romanticized and tokenized,\u201d said Eriel Deranger, executive director of Indigenous Climate Action and member of the facilitated working group for North America, part of the new UN structures established after Paris. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to collect and preserve indigenous knowledge while continuing to leave us out of the actual decision-making and positions of power. It\u2019s the only lever we have to hold states and governments accountable, but it\u2019s the same paternalistic system as ever. We\u2019re set up to fail, so that\u2019s where civil society must come in.\u201d\nTom Goldtooth, executive director of the North American Indigenous Environmental Network, who\u2019s attended every Cop since 1998, said indigenous knowledge holders were being \u201cco-opted and manipulated by the Eurocentric UN system\u201d. This week, it was announced that $1.7bn will be given to indigenous peoples and local communities in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet\u2019s lands and forests. Net-zero targets, the central theme of Cop26, revolve around incentivizing carbon capture markets through mass reforestation, biofuels and new technologies \u2013 which many indigenous leaders see as false climate solutions that will lead to further land grabs and environmental and cultural destruction. For them, keeping fossil fuels and minerals in the ground is the only way to curtail global heating and its devastating impacts. Chief Ninawa Inu Huni Kui, president of the Huni Kui People\u2019s Federation of the Brazilian Amazon, added: \u201cOur vision is very different to those who make the decisions at Cop. We have ancestral connections to the environment and Mother Earth. These are spiritual spaces that we would never negotiate or offset for money, but the working groups don\u2019t represent the views of our communities or explain what these carbon markets actually mean.\u201d\nAs the climate crisis intensifies with record floods, fires and heatwaves across the world, so does the violence against defenders. 2020 was the deadliest year on record for environmental and land defenders, with indigenous people accounting for half of the total 227 killed. Many, like C\u00e1ceres, had been resisting environmentally destructive extractive industries and energy projects including pipelines, dams, industrial wind and solar farms, and African palm plantations. Still, indigenous peoples have survived against the odds, and they are not giving up. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament of our resilience that even after hundreds of years of colonization and betrayal that we indigenous communities are still willing to sacrifice our lives, health and energy for this last-ditch attempt to save the planet,\u201d said Ruth Miller, climate justice director of the Alaska-based Native Movement, a Dena\u2019ina Athabaskan and Ashkenazi Russian Jewish woman, who is a member of the Curyung tribe. \u201cWe\u2019re here offering sustainable solutions to the rest of the world that require an ideological shift, not a green industry built on colonialism and repression. It\u2019s up to them if they listen or not.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/cop26-indigenous-activists-climate-crisis", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:53:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Paul Dacre departs from Daily Mail after 42 years", "article": "Paul Dacre has departed his role as chair of the Daily Mail\u2019s parent company, sources say, with the newspaper also no longer paying for his secretary and chauffeur. Although Dacre stood down as editor of the Daily Mail in 2018, he remained on the payroll after being given the largely honorific positions of chair and editor-in-chief of parent company Associated Newspapers.\nTwo individuals with knowledge of the situation said this arrangement ended last week, with Dacre also losing access to his personal support staff. His departure from the company all but marks the end of Dacre\u2019s 42-year-old association with the Daily Mail, which included a quarter of a century as editor. One source suggested it was the company\u2019s decision to let Dacre go after he had served as chair for exactly three years. The Daily Mail declined to comment, while Dacre could not be reached. The departure clears the way for Dacre, 72, to make a new application to be chair of the media regulator Ofcom after he failed the interview process on the previous attempt despite the backing of Downing Street. Dacre, one of the leading media campaigners for Brexit, was rarely seen in the Daily Mail newsroom after moving upstairs to an office on the executive floor of the company\u2019s Northcliffe House headquarters in west London. He used his position to pick battles with Geordie Greig, his Remain-supporting successor as Daily Mail editor. In one intervention Dacre wrote a public letter to the Financial Times accusing Greig of being \u201ceconomic with the actualit\u00e9\u201d when it came to suggesting advertisers thought the newspaper had become too toxic. He also accused Greig of failing to pay enough respect to Dacre\u2019s journalistic achievements. News of Dacre\u2019s departure comes after Daily Mail owner Viscount Rothermere, the great-grandson of the newspaper\u2019s founder, announced he is close to concluding a complicated series of financial transactions related to the business. This will allow Rothermere to take the parent company DMGT off the stock market and have total private control over the Daily Mail and its sister titles such as MailOnline, Metro, and the i. Dacre, who earned \u00a32.7m in his final year as Daily Mail editor, is still the favourite to be appointed as chair of Ofcom, with the government re-running the appointment process for his benefit. The new job advert has been rewritten to favour a more confrontational candidate after Dacre was judged not to have met the original criteria during his first application. If he is successful on the second attempt, he will help steer policy on issues from regulation of social media platforms such as Facebook, complaints about television news and oversight of postal services.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/03/paul-dacre-departs-from-daily-mail-after-42-years", "last_update": "2021-11-03T04:35:37Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Is a UK interest rate rise certain? Good question", "article": "It is a sign of the confusion surrounding the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision on Thursday that investors are unusually divided over which direction the central bank will go. Financial markets show that more than six in 10 investors are anticipating a hike in the cost of borrowing while a majority of City economists take the opposite view, telling a Reuters survey they expect rates will remain at historic lows, at least for the time being.\nIn a big week for central banks, America\u2019s Federal Reserve will today make its much more clearly signposted announcement on tapering the scale of its monthly stimulus package, though interest rates are expected to remain unchanged. Which way the BoE will swing, even at the 11th hour, is anyone\u2019s guess. Ahead of one of the most finely balanced monetary policy (MPC) meetings in a decade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s gauge of interest rate futures, known as BoE Watch, has stated there is a 100% likelihood of a rate rise in the UK this week. The views of City economists chime with MPC members Silvana Tenreyro and Catherine Mann, who have aired fears that an interest rate rise now could threaten a recovery that is already weakening. Governor Andrew Bailey, his chief economist Huw Pill and Michael Saunders, the former Citibank economist, have argued in speeches and comments that swift action could be needed to quell rising prices, swaying opinion in financial markets in favour of the BoE being the first major central bank to tighten policy. Bailey\u2019s remark that the bank \u201cwill have to act and must do so if we see a risk, particularly to medium-term inflation\u201d caught the eye of many investment funds seeking to hedge against rates going up. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden is also believed to be in favour of Threadneedle Street pushing rates from historic lows after he voted with Saunders at the last MPC meeting to stop quantitative easing (QE) in its tracks ahead of a planned cut off date in December. QE is the second strand of the BoE\u2019s stimulus programme and was ramped up by \u00a3250bn to \u00a3895bn after the pandemic hit. If four members of the committee have signed up to higher rates, it only takes one more to tip the scales. That puts another deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, in the frame, since the former Goldman Sachs economist has never voted against the governor in his seven years on the MPC. Deutsche bank economists Sanjay Raja and Panos Giannopoulos said after Bailey\u2019s intervention that they were changing their view and that the BoE would \u201cdeliver its first post-pandemic rate hike of 0.15%\u201d, adding: \u201cWe also expect the MPC to end its current QE programme \u2013 one month earlier than expected, trimming \u00a320bn from QE.\u201d Pride will be the deciding factor, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities. \u201cDisappointing [markets] now, we think, would be Bailey\u2019s least preferred option,\u201d they said, though they conceded a rate rise was not a done deal. The confusion surrounding the outcome of Thursday\u2019s meeting stems from the wide range of often contradictory data that has emerged in recent months. After Britain suffered its worst slump in the postwar era in March 2020, it has bounced back strongly this year. Job vacancy rates have spiralled higher and wages, which fell sharply last year, have recovered. Inflation, after dropping to almost zero earlier this year, has climbed since the spring above the BoE\u2019s target level of 2% to 3.1%. At the MPC\u2019s last meeting, it said rates would most likely need to rise by 0.5% next year to help bring down inflation to 2% over the next three years, though the minutes show it cautioned against early action. \u201cAll members agreed the outlook for the labour market, and hence underlying inflationary pressures, was particularly uncertain.\u201d David Blanchflower, the Ivy League economics professor and former MPC member, said the committee should ask itself how much of the pandemic dust had cleared. \u201cThe furlough scheme has only just ended, consumer confidence is sliding backwards and businesses are nervous about the future. How can they say the economy is strong enough to cope with more expensive credit? If anything the indicators show the economy is weakening, which means that an interest rate rise would be a colossal mistake.\u201d The other major central banks are a long way from raising rates. The Federal Reserve has held rates at near zero since the start of the pandemic and plans to continue adding to a $8.5tn QE programme, albeit at a slower pace.\nThe European central bank has pledged to maintain its policy of negative interest rates and boost QE for the foreseeable future while the Bank of Japan said last week that it plans to redouble its efforts to stimulate a lacklustre recovery in the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Ana Boata, head of economic research at credit insurer Euler Hermes, said Bailey\u2019s comments \u201chave pushed the BoE into a corner\u201d. She believes a rate rise now could push the UK into recession, such is the pressure on household finances from higher prices, only moderate wage rises and significant tax rises due next spring. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said while some MPC members might argue the government was pouring fuel on the inflationary fire, this view was misguided. \u201cTightening policy when other major central banks are still in loosening mode would seem incongruous, particularly when the UK economy was more affected by the pandemic than the US and the eurozone,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/03/is-a-uk-interest-rate-rise-certain-good-question", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:33:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Country diary: A frightful fungus worthy of an Edgar Allan Poe tale", "article": "I have come on an annual pilgrimage, this autumn afternoon, along a muddy track under a tunnel of trees, in search of two toadstools that fire the imagination. One is almost extraterrestrial in appearance, the other a Halloween horror story from the underworld. Until two years ago, in a lifetime of looking, I had never seen an earthstar. But then a naturalist told me about a colony of these most charismatic toadstools, rare in our region, growing on a bank beside this path. And here they are again today, collared earthstars, Geastrum triplex, half hidden among ivy, looking like invaders from another planet. Each began when barely visible underground hyphae coalesced into an egg-shaped object on the soil surface. Now the outer rind has split into segments that are folded back, like spacecraft landing-module ramps, revealing a sphere with a pore in the top, ready to puff clouds of spores whenever a raindrop splashes against its paper-thin walls.\nAs the autumn days grow shorter, the fleshy rays will curl back further, eventually levering the whole toadstool from the ground. Then it will be free for the wind to carry away across the landscape, like tumbleweed, shedding more spores as it bounds. If evolution\u2019s twin forces of chance and necessity hadn\u2019t already crafted this unlikely fungus, then HG Wells might surely have invented it for a role in The War of the Worlds. Further down the path, another toadstool, this one worthy of a gruesome Edgar Allan Poe horror story: dead moll\u2019s fingers, Xylaria longipes. Miniature hands of slender, spongy fingers attached to skeletal wrists, reaching up from the shallow grave of a decaying sycamore branch. This species has an explosive method for finding new hosts, shooting spores from microscopic flasks clustered in pits on its surface: fungal artillery, silent, unseen, performing its seasonal bombardment. The sun is setting, daylight has begun to fade. A chill has settled over the wood. Time for a final deep breath of glorious autumnal scent before heading home, lungs filled with the aroma of damp earth, decaying leaves and, no doubt, some spores of earthstar and dead moll\u2019s fingers. \u2022 Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/country-diary-a-frightful-fungus-worthy-of-an-edgar-allan-poe-tale", "last_update": "2021-11-02T14:06:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Democrats\u2019 stinging Virginia defeat raises stark questions for Biden\u2019s tenure", "article": "Joe Biden exuded confidence. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win,\u201d the US president told reporters before departing Cop26 in Glasgow. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to win in Virginia.\u201d But as Biden returns to Washington, he faces questions about why his prediction was so wrong \u2013 and whether Democrats\u2019 loss in the most important election of the year will send his presidency into a downward spiral.\nThe Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s surprise victory over the Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the race for governor of Virginia is a brutal rebuke for Biden, who had personally invested in the race, twice making the short trip from Washington to campaign for McAuliffe at rallies. It will particularly sting because Donald Trump, whom he defeated in Virginia by 10 percentage points in last year\u2019s presidential election, will doubtless seek to claim credit for the result and savor his revenge. But the truth is that this election was more about the current president than the spectre of the last one. Biden\u2019s ambitious agenda has stalled in Congress. By his own admission, the inertia has sucked oxygen away from priorities such as a police reform and voting rights, disillusioning the activists who fuel Democratic turnout. Inflation and gasoline prices are up. Global supply chains are buckling. And Biden\u2019s sunny predictions for post-withdrawal Afghanistan were as off the mark as his predictions for Virginia.\nThe president\u2019s sagging approval rating of 42% combined with historical headwinds to drag McAuliffe down. Nothing energizes a political movement like opposition: the president\u2019s party has lost every election for governor of Virginia over almost half a century \u2013 the exception was McAuliffe himself in 2013. But this time McAuliffe failed to inspire. The chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential primary campaign had a distinct whiff of Clinton 2016: a career politician imbued with a sense of entitlement who constantly found himself on the defensive against an upstart candidate drawing bigger crowds. Like Hillary Clinton\u2019s reference to \u201cdeplorables\u201d, McAuliffe made a perceived gaffe \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach\u201d \u2013 which was replayed endlessly in Youngkin attack ads. McAuliffe\u2019s central argument \u2013 that Youngkin is an acolyte of Trump \u2013 was about the past. Youngkin\u2019s central argument \u2013 that schools are under attack from culture warriors on race and gender \u2013 was about the future, even if it was riddled with falsehoods. To many voters, the future tends to be more persuasive. Enough of them did not seem to know or care that Youngkin\u2019s arguments on schools were based on a lie. He stoked fears about critical race theory being taught in schools \u2013 it isn\u2019t \u2013 with a caricature of Black children learning to think they are victims and white children learning to self-hate. It cut through and proved effective in a febrile, pandemic-era atmosphere where parents shout and even turn violent at school board meetings debating issues such as gender identity and mask mandates. Whereas McAuliffe wanted to nationalize the election, Youngkin managed to keep it local, albeit by tapping into Fox News talking points following last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Expect this incendiary mix of children and racism to be chapter one of the Republican playbook in next year\u2019s midterm elections for Congress. Expect chapter two to be How to Deal with a Problem Called Donald Trump.\nThe 45th president will still be welcome in the safe districts of the Make America Great Again nation, sure to draw fanatical crowds and turn out the vote. But in swing states, Youngkin has shown Republicans the way to have their cake and eat it too. In the Republican primary, he praised Trump and fanned his false claims of voter fraud by raising concerns about \u201celection integrity\u201d. In the general election, he was willing to tacitly pat Trump on the back without ever embracing him \u2013 he eschewed mentions of the former president in campaign speeches and must have been tremendously relieved that Trump never turned up in person. Youngkin squared the circle that many Republicans have struggled with, creating a template for how to win over moderates and independents without alienating the Trump base, or vice versa. Call it the Goldilocks principle of strategic ambiguity: neither too hot nor too cold, but just the right temperature. Democrats knew exactly what he was doing. McAuliffe relentlessly tried to conflate Youngkin with Trump. At a rally last week, Biden warned: \u201cExtremism can come in many forms. It can come in the rage of a mob driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a smile and a fleece vest. Either way, the big lie is still a big lie.\u201d But it was all in vain. Youngkin, like Trump, might have emphasized his status as a businessman and political outsider but otherwise came over as a suburban dad, more polished and less profane: the acceptable face of Trumpism. Yet his tactics were just as dark, dishonest and divisive. Democrats will now need to find a counter-strategy fast. Some commentators have suggested that members of the House and Senate could desert Biden and rush to the exits, retiring rather than facing a bloodbath in the midterms, so weakening the president\u2019s hand at a crucial moment for his agenda. Virginia is a warning cry that the party needs strong leadership to get it done before things fall apart. Wednesday marks the first anniversary of Biden\u2019s defeat of Trump in a presidential election like no other. But the pandemic of Trumpism rages in new and unexpected ways \u2013 and the Youngkin variant may prove among the most dangerous.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/02/virginia-governor-result-joe-biden-democrats", "last_update": "2021-11-03T06:42:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018I could count all its teeth\u2019: Italian couple find burglar is endangered brown bear ", "article": "An Italian woman who investigated what she thought was a burglar on her balcony, has described a petrifying encounter with a rare brown bear. The Marsican bear had climbed on to her bedroom balcony in Pescosolido, a village in the Lazio province of Frosinone, just days after a bear was spotted bathing in the fountain of a neighbouring village. Annalisa Castagna and her husband, Claudio Parravano, came face-to-face with the bear on Sunday night. The Marsican is a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle Italy\u2019s Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions. The couple initially thought there was a burglar on their first-floor balcony after hearing noises shortly after midnight, and stepped outside to investigate, using the light of their mobile phones. \u201cI practically screamed in the face of the bear,\u201d Castagna wrote in a Facebook post shared with the online community group Sei di Pescosolido se. \u201cThe bear snarled back at me and tried to reach me with its paw. In the dim light of the mobile phone, I was able to count all its teeth and see its red tongue.\u201d Castagna leapt back inside, while Parravano threw himself over the balcony to escape the animal, causing minor injuries. The bear fled, leaving its faeces on the balcony. \u201cThe bear was certainly frightened, possibly even more than we were,\u201d said Castagna. \u201cThe fear was great and we thank God [nothing happened]. We ask our fellow Pescosolido citizens to be careful \u2026 and we hope those in charge will ensure that the bear returns to its natural habitat without being harmed.\u201d The encounter came a few days after a Marsican brown bear took a dip in the fountain of the main square in San Donato Val di Comino, a nearby village of about 1,200 residents where bears have occasionally been sighted on the streets. A resident, Vania Tramontozzi, took photos and shared them with the Facebook group, Visit San Donato Val di Comino. \u201cMy husband is the manager of the bar right by the square,\u201d Tramontozzi told Kodami, a website for news about animals. \u201cSeeing the bear so quiet and relaxed in the fountain, at about 7.45pm, when there were some people around, was very emotional.\u201d Both villages are close to the vast national park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise, home to the endangered Marsican bears, of which only an estimated 50 are left. The animals tend to venture into inhabited areas more between September and November, but are not known to be aggressive towards humans. A spokesperson for the national park, Daniela D\u2019Amico, said: \u201cExperts from the national park went to Pescosolido today to better understand what happened on Sunday night, but it is a little strange to hear that the bear managed to climb on to the balcony.\u201d Marsican bears that gravitate towards towns in search of food during the autumn are either females with cubs or young bears, she said. \u201cBears are opportunistic and follow their stomachs \u2026 in this period they need to eat a lot in order to face the winter.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re malnourished. There is abundant food in the mountains. But staying in the mountains is risky for the young, who will have to share their territory and food with adult bears, and for female bears, who are at risk of male bears killing their cubs, forcing the female back into heat.\u201d In 2019, the Italian branch of the World Wildlife Fund warned that the Marsican brown bear faced extinction.

The Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, had campaigned with Biden and Barack Obama but it was not enough to prevent the Republican Glenn Youngkin pulling off an upset. The AP called the race for Youngkin in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Republican took an early lead after polls closed that he maintained throughout the evening, while McAuliffe lagged in key counties that Biden swept in 2020. Clenching his fists then clapping his hands, Youngkin addressed jubilant supporters in Chantilly just after 1am. \u201cAll righty, Virginia, we won this thing!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow much fun!\u201d The 54-year-old political neophyte described it as \u201ca defining moment\u201d for millions of Virginians \u201csharing dreams and hopes\u201d. Youngkin promised: \u201cTogether, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth and friends, we are going to start that transformation on day one. There is no time to waste.\u201d In a nod to what became his defining campaign issue, the Republican said: \u201cWe are going to restore excellence in our schools... We are going to introduce choice in our public school system... Friends, we\u2019re going to embrace our parents, not ignore them. We\u2019re gonna press forward with a curriculum that includes listening to parents\u2019 input.\u201d As on the campaign trail, Youngkin did not utter the name \u201cTrump\u201d. The battle in Virginia has been seen as a litmus test of Biden\u2019s presidency one year after he won the White House, and it coincided with his agenda stalling in Congress and his approval rating sinking to 42%. \u201cThe fight continues,\u201d said McAuliffe in a speech on Tuesday night, thanking his campaign staff for a hard-fought race, but stopping short of a concession. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we protect women\u2019s right to choose here in the commonwealth of Virginia. We\u2019ve got to make sure everyone gets quality, affordable healthcare here in the commonwealth of Virginia. Everybody\u2019s entitled to a world-class education here in the commonwealth of Virginia and we are going to continue that fight tonight, and every day going forward.\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s all-out effort to portray Youngkin as an acolyte of Donald Trump proved less effective than the Republican\u2019s laser-like focus on whipping up parents\u2019 fear and anger about culture war issues in Virginia\u2019s schools. Youngkin made false claims that critical race theory \u2013 an analytic framework through which academics examine the ways that racial disparities are reproduced by the law \u2013 is rampant in the state\u2019s education system (in fact it is not taught). His campaign zeroed in on a perceived gaffe by McAuliffe at one of their debates: \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d\nImportantly, Youngkin was also successful walking a political tightrope in which he accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement but never mentioned him in stump speeches or invited him to campaign with him in person. He cultivated sufficient ambiguity to appeal to moderate Republicans without alienating the Trump base. History was on Youngkin\u2019s side in that the party that loses the White House tends to be energised and usually wins the Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race a year later. But McAuliffe himself had bucked that rule when he became governor in 2014 (he was limited to one term). However, no Republican had won statewide office since 2009, and Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points, meaning that a Democratic loss here would reverberate across the nation. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a similar story was unfolding as the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, fought to win re-election against his Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli. That race was too close to call, with Ciattarelli narrowly ahead. If Murphy holds his office, he would be the first Democrat re-elected as the state\u2019s governor in 44 years, while a defeat would bode ill for national Democrats. At McAuliffe\u2019s election night event at a hotel in Tysons, Virginia, giant TVs that had been showing cable news coverage were switched off long before any result was finalized. Stunned supporters trailed out into the chilly night.\nManisha Singh, 48, an analyst, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing. I can\u2019t imagine all the lies that were spread to influence voters. I was knocking on doors and people were saying take the porn out of public schools, which is a lie. They were just repeating what they had seen on Fox News.\u201d Singh added: \u201cThis might be a huge wake-up call to Democrats. We always play nice when the other party spreads lies. We need to be more aggressive. \u201c Argument quickly broke out among national Democrats over what had gone wrong. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said in a statement: \u201cTerry McAuliffe sadly can blame his loss on a few corporate-aligned obstructionist Democrats who blocked bold action in Congress, plus his own reliance on backward-looking Trump messaging. It added: \u201cDemocrats won\u2019t win simply by branding one opponent after another as a Trump clone, and then hoping to squeak out a razor-thin win. When Democrats fail to run on big ideas or fulfill bold campaign promises, we depress our base while allowing Republicans to use culture wars to hide their real agenda.\u201d McAuliffe, a career politician and establishment Democrat, is likely to point to Biden\u2019s falling popularity and Washington gridlock as factors in his defeat. Youngkin, a former executive at the private-equity firm the Carlyle Group, sold himself as a political outsider challenging the liberal elite. His strategy \u2013 a delicate balancing act of stoking culture wars in education and winking at Trump without fully embracing him \u2013 is seen as a potential blueprint for Republican candidates in next year\u2019s congressional elections. Trump said in a statement: \u201cAll McAuliffe did was talk Trump, Trump, Trump and he lost! What does that tell you, Fake News? I guess people running for office as Democrats won\u2019t be doing that too much longer. I didn\u2019t even have to go rally for Youngkin, because McAuliffe did it for me.\u201d Dan Conston, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super political action committee dedicated to electing Republicans to the House of Representatives, said: \u201cTonight\u2019s results put every Democrat in Congress on notice. \u201cVirginia was once ground zero for suburban decline but has now become the epicenter of a Republican comeback in 2022. If Republicans can win even in a state so blue that Joe Biden won by 10 points, then far more Democrats are in peril next year than they want to admit.\u201d The battles in Virginia and New Jersey came as voters in states across the US headed to the polls on Tuesday, an off-year election day, to cast their ballots for local governors, mayors and public measures. In New York, the former police officer Eric Adams easily won his race to become the next mayor of New York City. In Boston, Michelle Wu made history when she defeated Annissa Essaibi-George to become the first woman of color and Asian American elected as the city\u2019s mayor. History was also made in Durham, North Carolina, where Elaine O\u2019Neal became the city\u2019s first Black female mayor after campaigning on neighborhood safety, housing and economic relief in the aftermath of the pandemic, while Abdullah Hammoud won the mayoral race in Dearborn, Michigan, making him the city\u2019s first Arab American leader. In Minneapolis, voters rejected an initiative that would have replaced the police department with a new department of public safety, nearly a year and a half after the police killing of George Floyd inspired nationwide protests against police brutality.

{"title": "Why is Facebook shutting down its facial recognition system and deleting \u2018faceprints\u2019?", "article": "Facebook has announced it is deleting about 1bn \u201cfaceprints\u201d it used as part of a facial recognition system for photo tagging, citing concerns with the technology. Meta, the company formally known as Facebook, announced on Tuesday it would end its use of facial recognition technology in the coming weeks. A third of Facebook\u2019s users, or about 1 billion people, had opted into the service, Meta\u2019s vice-president of artificial intelligence Jerome Pesenti said. So is the company really concerned about people\u2019s privacy, or is it just a public relations move? How was Facebook using facial recognition technology? When people opted in to allowing the use of facial recognition, Facebook scanned a \u201cfaceprint\u201d of that user and used it to find photos and videos of them on the platform, and suggested tagging them.\nIt was also used to identify if someone else was impersonating that user on Facebook, and helped with accessibility for people with visual impairments by telling them who was in a photo. Why is Facebook stopping it? Pesenti said while facial recognition technology is a powerful tool to verify identity, it needs strong privacy and transparency controls to let people limit how their faces are used. He noted there were \u201cmany concerns\u201d about the place of facial recognition technology in society, with regulators still playing catch up. \u201cAmid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate,\u201d he said. Pesenti said facial recognition was most valuable when operating on a person\u2019s device only \u2013 such as for unlocking iPhones \u2013 rather than communicating with an external server, as Facebook\u2019s technology had operated. It comes at a time when Facebook has faced widespread criticism over its attitude towards user privacy and safety, after the release of tens of thousands of internal documents from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\nWhat will happen to tagged photos? A spokesperson for Facebook said there would be no change to existing tagged photos or videos that were tagged using the technology, just that there will not be a suggested tag in the future. What will it mean for assisting people with visual impairments? People will still be able to add text and tags to their photos and videos, but Facebook won\u2019t automatically suggest them. What will happen to my faceprint? Facebook says it will be deleted. If you opted out of the service before this, or never opted in, or deleted your account, Facebook has said the faceprint would not be retained.\nHad there been any data breach or sale of faceprint information? Facebook has previously said that the only person who could access the faceprint was the account user, and a spokesperson confirmed there had been no other access to the faceprint information. Will it be replaced with something else? The spokesperson said Meta believes there are \u201ca number of potentially positive use cases for facial recognition in the future\u201d and it\u2019s something the company will explore, but privacy, control and transparency will be front of mind. \u201cFor each potential future application, we\u2019ll continue to be public about its intended use, how people can have control over these systems and their personal data, and how we\u2019re ensuring the technology lives up to our responsible innovation framework,\u201d he said. Meta is shifting its focus to creating the metaverse, and trying a whole bunch of new things at the same time as it battles against an increasingly negative public image in the past few months.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/03/why-is-facebook-shutting-down-its-facial-recognition-system-and-deleting-faceprints", "last_update": "2021-11-03T04:28:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "NSW premier orders grants review as it\u2019s revealed $20m school solar program went mostly to Coalition seats ", "article": "The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ordered a review of grants funding in the state but denied the move was an admission that two grants at the centre of an anti-corruption investigation were improperly awarded. On Wednesday, Perrottet announced he had ordered the department of premier and cabinet to conduct a review of grant procedures to \u201censure the fairness and probity of current grant systems\u201d. But the state opposition says it is concerned the review may not go far enough. Labor said it would adopt recommendations made by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) to improve transparency over grant funding, as well as introducing rules requiring ministers to explain when they diverged from department advice. Perrottet\u2019s announcement followed evidence by his predecessor, Gladys Berejiklian, to the state\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog that the government \u201cthrew money at seats to keep them\u201d and grants were made to help win votes. This week, Icac concluded 11 days of public hearings into Berejiklian\u2019s conduct, a probe which centred around two multi-million dollar grants in the seat held by her then-secret boyfriend, the Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. The investigation heard evidence that Maguire had consistently lobbied for the grants over several years, and that they were ultimately signed off by Berejiklian despite concerns from within the public sector. The former premier used her appearance before Icac to defend the grants, saying they had been awarded in part to shore up support for the Coalition government following the loss of the Orange by-election to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party. Since her resignation, Perrottet has been critical of the practice of pork barrelling in government, saying he disagreed with the \u201cconcept\u201d. On Wednesday, he said he had asked both the department and the productivity commissioner, Peter Achterstraat, to conduct a review of grant funding.\n\u201cTaxpayers expect the distribution of funds will be fair, I share that expectation,\u201d Perrottet said. \u201cEvery dollar from NSW taxpayers is important. I am committed to making sure grant programs are fair, robust and follow best practice when those dollars are put to work in the community.\u201d But during a press conference, Perrottet denied the review was an admission proper process had not been followed in relation to the two Wagga Wagga grants, saying it was \u201cimportant there is public confidence in relation to the expenditure of taxpayer funds\u201d. Perrottet also said the report, due in April, may not lead to any concrete changes in grant funding processes. \u201cThese guidelines haven\u2019t been looked at since 2010, I think it is incredibly important we look at it. Perhaps nothing will change, it\u2019s really a matter for the government to look at a better way of doing things,\u201d he said.\nThe opposition seized on those comments, criticising Perrottet for refusing to commit to an overhaul of grant funding. On Wednesday, NSW Labor said in government it would require ministers to explain \u201cin writing and provide reasons\u201d if they went against a department recommendation on grant funding. The party would also introduce recommendations made by Icac last year as part of its submission to an inquiry into the integrity of grant funding. The inquiry, prompted by the government\u2019s $252m Stronger Communities Fund, found money was overwhelmingly spent in Coalition-held seats and led to an admission from Berejiklian that it did amount to pork barrelling but was \u201cnot an illegal practice\u201d. In its submission to the inquiry, Icac recommended changes to the government\u2019s 2010 \u201cgood practice guide\u201d to include obligations for ministers to \u201cact ethically and in accordance with general probity principals such as transparency, accountability and fairness\u201d. \u201cThe growing culture of pork-barrelling by this Liberal National government must be broken,\u201d Labor leader Chris Minns said. Perrottet\u2019s announcement came at the same time it was revealed more than 90% of schools selected as part of a $20m pilot to fund solar power systems were in Coalition-held seats. The Daily Telegraph reported 92% of the 25 schools selected as part of the pilot program came from Coalition seats, including two in the ultra-marginal seat of Penrith in western Sydney which is held by deputy Liberal party leader Stuart Ayres. Three of the schools were from Dubbo, which is held by the Nationals with a margin of just over 2%. Only two of the 25 schools were from non-government seats, including one held by the rival Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party.

Dominic Perrottet owes them an explanation,\u201d he said. But the government has defended the grants. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the schools chosen for the pilot program were selected by the department of education based on areas where the \u201celectricity grid is constrained\u201d \u2013 and that the program had been targeted at regional areas. Her office released correspondence which it said showed the schools chosen for the pilot had been recommended by the department. An email chain from June shows the minister\u2019s office had requested the department provide it with the list of schools, and that almost all of the schools selected came from its initial recommendation. Two of the recommended schools were not selected because one was in recess and the other did not require the project.\n\u201cThey are located in areas where the electricity grid is constrained and, in order to deliver commitments made through the cooler classrooms program, require an electrical upgrade which would have involved a costly upgrade to electrical infrastructure,\u201d a spokesperson for the minister said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/nsw-premier-orders-grants-review-as-its-revealed-20m-school-solar-program-went-mostly-to-coalition-seats", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:27:17Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Victorian health service can fire nurses who refuse Covid vaccine, court rules", "article": "An injunction to stop Victoria\u2019s largest public health service from firing nurses who are refusing the Covid-19 vaccination or refusing to disclose their vaccination status has been thrown out by the federal court ahead of a trial challenging the vaccine mandate. Nick Ferrett QC is representing about 90 nurses at Monash Health, and told the court on Wednesday that under Victoria\u2019s Occupational Health and Safety Act, the nurses should be consulted before any disciplinary action is taken against them. \u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion that any of the \u2026 relevant employees \u2026 is dogmatic about vaccines, and unwilling in all circumstances to get vaccinated,\u201d Ferrett said. \u201cSo consultation has value in those circumstances.\u201d\nA directive from Victoria\u2019s chief health officer under the Public Health Act makes it clear that health workers must be fully vaccinated, having received at least their first Covid-19 vaccine dose by 29 October, in order to work in a healthcare setting. They must provide evidence of vaccination to their employer. But Justice John Snaden said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Monash Health was trying to prevent nurses from exercising their workplace rights by commencing disciplinary action to fire them. \u201cOn the contrary, the evidence that there is very much suggests that the course that has been plotted has been plotted because Monash Health has formed the view that under the public health directions by which it is bound, they\u2019re not permitted to do anything else [other than terminate employment],\u201d he said. Ferrett argued whether Monash Health had commenced the disciplinary action because workers were asserting their rights and pushing to be consulted should be explored at trial. But Snaden said the nurses \u201c\u2026 can\u2019t point to anything in the way of evidence that substantiates their contention\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cThe relevant employees maintain that they ought to have been consulted about the vaccination direction and that the disciplinary action to which they are imminently to be subjected will be visited upon them because they possessed, and or, sought to exercise that right to be consulted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears very unlikely, perhaps even impossible on the material that has been filed to date, that the applicants will be able to succeed in their claim that they have been or will soon be the victims of adverse action because or for reasons that include that they have possessed or exercised workplace rights, or because Monash Health wishes to prevent them from exercising any such right. \u201cThat of course presupposes that they in fact do possess such a right or rights. That will be a live question at trial.\u201d\nChris O\u2019Grady QC, representing Monash Health, said the employer had simply been following the chief health officer\u2019s directions. \u201cIn light of the CHO directions it goes without saying that anyone working in the health sector is going to have difficulty working in that sector absent their willingness to either be vaccinated or disclose their vaccination status,\u201d he said. Monash Health also denied it was obliged to consult with employees before terminating them, and that it would, in any case, not change its requirement to abide by the CHO directions. Snaden said when the matter goes to trial, if the court finds the vaccine mandate was unlawful, then the nurses would likely have their employment reinstated and receive back pay. Therefore, the court had no reason to block disciplinary action including Monash Health firing the nurses in the meantime, he said, adding that the case had been \u201cat best, weak\u201d. Monash Health had given undertakings not to take action against the relevant nurses until the matter was determined. In light of Snaden\u2019s decision on Wednesday, Monash Health was now free to terminate the staff.

{"title": "Victoria Covid restrictions: reopening rules for Melbourne, regional Vic, freedoms for vaccinated people \u2013 explained", "article": "Covid restrictions across Victoria changed from 6 PM, 29 October, after the state reached an 80% full vaccination rate. Melbourne had endured 262 days, nearly nine months, of stay-at-home restrictions that went over 6 lockdowns since March 2020. Now, restrictions are the same across Victoria for those who are vaccinated. The Victorian roadmap is here. In summary, from 29 October: No restrictions on travel around the state. No masks outside. People can return to work if fully vaccinated. Outdoor public gatherings of 30 people allowed. Gyms and retail reopen, subject to density limits. Indoor and outdoor hospitality venue limits increase. Indoor entertainment venues open at 75% capacity, as many as 1000 patrons. Outdoor venues as many as 5000 patrons. Indoor sport resume with density cap.

{"title": "Midnight Oil, Alex Lahey and Thelma Plum: Australia\u2019s best new music for November", "article": "Ball Park Music \u2013 Sunscreen For fans of: Superdrag, Pavement, T Rex Brisbane\u2019s most beloved band sealed the deal with a record-breaking 13 shows at local venue The Triffid last year, making the most of living in the sunshine state where live music fought through the entire pandemic. Sunscreen is their first new music since those shows, and it\u2019s a restless tune, Frankensteined from a number of disparate pieces songwriter Sam Cromack had lying around, searching for a home. For this reason, structurally it\u2019s a maze, weaving from part to part without any sense of direction: one minute the band breaks into Beach Boys harmonies, the next they\u2019re riding a wave of chugging bass and quick-fire vocal melodies. This could have been two or three great tunes, but instead, it\u2019s one exceptional summer single. Slip, slop, slap it on your stereo (sorry). For more: check out the band\u2019s self-titled 2020 album, which is up for two Aria awards. Spacey Jane \u2013 Lunchtime For fans of: the Hummingbirds, the Cure, the Lemonheads Belying its joyous propulsion and a run of peeling guitars that recall an 80s single by the Cure, Lunchtime was reportedly written while frontman Caleb Harper was experiencing a heavy dose of post-inebriation anxiety, and his hopeless mindset is plastered all over the lyrics of this audio panic attack \u2013 an existential crisis in and out before your lunch order even comes to the table. Harper\u2019s voice breaks in just the right way during the earworm chorus, while the lovely backing vocals from bassist Peppa Lane recall the Hummingbirds in top flight. For more: check out their June single, Lots of Nothing.\nMidnight Oil \u2013 Rising Seas For fans of: planet Earth Peter Garrett and co have been warning us about climate change since second-degree sunburns were a must-have summer accessory. Yet here we are, dragging the climate chain on an international stage at Cop26, and Midnight Oil are, suitably and understandably, still filled with rage. They are taking aim at inept leaders and corruption that leaps across industries and party lines, and this time Garrett can\u2019t dance-shake off the anger. \u201cEvery child put down your toys and come inside to sleep,\u201d he growls at the start of the song. \u201cWe have to look you in the eye and say we sold you cheap.\u201d The band delivers its grim message with the same raw power of its best anthems. This is an important song, and hopefully it won\u2019t fall on deaf ears. For more: check out last year\u2019s collaboration album The Makarrata Project. Alex Lahey \u2013 Spike the Punch For fans of: Paramore, the Starting Line, Best Coast It\u2019s fitting that Alex Lahey\u2019s music has appeared on Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater \u2013 she is one of the few artists these days doing pop-punk that neatly sidesteps the self-pity for a hefty dose of glorious, hedonistic self-sabotage, like spiking the punch or launching yourself down a concrete ramp without kneepads. With guitar harmonies that sit between Queen and the Darkness, a slightly warped beat that recalls the Postal Service, and a propulsion and punch that belongs on a Cheap Trick album (or at least a Blink-182 set list), Lahey\u2019s audible influences are all over the shop, in the best possible way. For more: Listen to On My Way, the theme song for animation The Mitchells vs The Machines. Punko \u2013 Cash Under the Bed For fans of: Kate Bush, the Donnie Darko soundtrack, the Church\nPunko is Liv Jansz, a severely talented Melbourne artist now based in Newcastle, where she crafts haunting and wonderful pop music that leans towards the 1980s without settling into pastiche. Co-produced by Bonnie Knight, the duo meld a Nevermind-sounding chorused-out guitar with frosty synths and dark lyrics about twisted love and the abusive bonds that tie and confuse. The song creeps slowly and ominously, with minimalist instrumentation, hypnotic guitar lines and vocal refrains. For more: Punko\u2019s debut album Plants Singing is out March 2022. Check out her first single Undivided. Thelma Plum \u2013 Homecoming Queen Strings For fans of: Ella Fitzgerald, Little Birdy, Lana Del Rey Homecoming Queen was the standout track from Thelma Plum\u2019s exceptional Better in Blak album, but it struggled to find a home, appearing as a stripped-back waltz, then as an Alice Ivy remix. This definitive version, draped in strings, underscores its beauty and heartache. Feeling unseen as a young Indigenous Australian must be a crushing and damaging experience, and Plum chronicles this experience and her own hard-fought rise to self-respect in a wonderfully moving way. It is, unfortunately, a widely felt experience; as personally as she paints her first two verses, it\u2019s the bridge that points this out: \u201c\u2019Cause in 1967 I wasn\u2019t human, and in 1994 I was born,\u201d she sings. \u201cI\u2019m still here. We are still here.\u201d For more: check out her entire album, Better in Blak, as well as her haunting cover of Powderfinger\u2019s These Days.\ne4444e \u2013 Wear No Flag For fans of: White Fence, Alex G, Modest Mouse Newcastle multi-instrumentalist Romy Church is one of the best young artists in the country, creating weird, warped pop songs one minute, and Aphex Twin-sounding doomscapes the next. Here he leans into the acoustic-based pop side of his immensely Google-friendly e4444e project, sounding like a lost outtake from the first Ben Kweller album or Beck on K Records. With unsettling tempo changes that suck like quicksand, single-syllable melodies that lead into a slightly funky breakdown, and a voice that sounds uncannily like Bandcamp hero Alex G, this is a top-shelf single, and a great indicator for Church\u2019s second album, which we\u2019ll get to hear in a few long weeks. For more: new album Autumnal Eve is out 19 November. Columbus \u2013 Temporary Summer For fans of: Yellowcard, Luca Brasi, Relient K\nThis sun-dappled slice of joyous pop punk may just make Melbourne three-piece Columbus our latest international export. Close your eyes and you can imagine this gem soundtracking any number of MTV shows about love and island, or any teen movie that chronicles that last important summer before college. The impermanence of summer is well represented in anything from Grease to Yellowcard\u2019s Ocean Avenue \u2013 to which this song owes a substantial sonic debt \u2013 and for good reason: it is such a bittersweet and universal sentiment. As long as young people are falling in love under a burning orb, bands like Columbus will neatly wrap that feeling and blast it back at them with a half-time chorus and a singalong hook. For more: listen to previous singles Can\u2019t Hide From What Hurts, Out of Time and Pain Is a Mirror. Alice Ivy ft Sycco \u2013 Weakness For fans of: disco Kylie Minogue, Pnau, Sneaky Sound System If this bright, sun-filled dance tune was released back in the heyday of Channel [V], Alice Ivy would have found herself with a No 1 hit. As it stands, she still has a fairly good shot at the title: it would be a programming travesty if commercial radio didn\u2019t pick this up and blast it through car stereos. With a chorus that will stick in your head for days, and breezy, tight production, this warm banger is destined to be one of the big songs of the summer. Alice Ivy\u2019s discography is only two records deep, but already she has showcased many various talents: bouncing off Camp Cope vocalist Georgia Maq on previous single Someone Stranger, remixing Thelma Plum and genre-bouncing without betraying her core sound. This is her best work to date. For more: check out 2020 album Don\u2019t Sleep. Montaigne \u2013 Now (in Space) For fans of: Rihanna, Drake, Jhen\u00e9 Aiko\nAny song that boasts a video clip with aliens and universe-sized plates of pasta deserves to go viral on its own obvious merits, but when it is affixed to a tune as lovelorn and bouncy as Montaigne\u2019s latest gem, then the sky\u2019s the limit. Equally as anthemic as her Eurovision song with a more futuristic, glitchy production bed, this is the first track from a forthcoming record Montaigne promises is \u201cgoing to be the peak of my career\u201d. She further describes it as \u201cbeautiful and wholesome\u201d, which is the perfect descriptor for this single. For more: check out her 2019 album, Complex.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/03/midnight-oil-alex-lahey-and-thelma-plum-australias-best-new-music-for-november", "last_update": "2021-11-03T04:18:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Global pollution price could cut greenhouse gases by 12%, says report", "article": "Creating an international price for carbon emissions could reduce global greenhouse gases by 12% at a cost of less than 1% of global GDP, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) and PwC. The report found that if global governments agreed together to set a price for pollution to help cut carbon emissions the cost would be less than the economic losses triggered by the fallout of a runaway climate crisis. The \u201ccarbon revenues\u201d raked in to government coffers from the world\u2019s most-polluting companies could also be used to help hard-pressed households or ploughed back into green industries which help reduce emissions while creating jobs and economic growth, the report found. Bob Moritz, the global chair of auditing giant PwC, said setting a global carbon price could make a \u201csignificant contribution to tackling global warming by accelerating emissions reductions\u201d. The report analysed a scheme proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this year to help accelerate the world\u2019s carbon emissions cuts by 2030 in a bid to stay within 1.5C to 2C of global heating compared with pre-industrialised levels, as set out under the Paris agreement in 2015. \u201cWe found this could be done without severe economic damage to livelihoods and business, although the effects would be somewhat uneven across the world. The costs to society and business of failing to act are far greater,\u201d Mortiz added. Under the IMF scheme companies with high greenhouse gas emissions, in high-income countries, would be subject to a carbon price of $75 for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. This would fall to $50 a tonne for polluters in middle-income countries, and $25 a tonne for low-income countries. Currently, the price of carbon is set at anywhere from $0 to more than $130 per tonne of CO2 equivalent across different global regions. In some cases this has created an uneven playing field by making it cheaper for international companies to move high-carbon activities, such as manufacturing, to countries without carbon schemes to avoid paying a price for pollution. But WEF and PwC found widespread participation in carbon price set across the global economy, even at reduced price floors for low and middle-income countries, would lead to very little \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d from companies moving their manufacturing to countries where carbon prices are lower. B\u00f8rge Brende, the president of WEF, said although the findings of the report are \u201cextremely positive\u201d, a huge amount of cooperation between governments and private sector companies would be key for carbon pricing to move ahead and accelerate efforts for a more sustainable and inclusive recovery. The political and technical challenges behind creating a global carbon price have stalled plans, leaving a patchwork of different international schemes to reduce carbon emissions which include mandatory emissions trading and carbon taxes, and voluntary carbon offset schemes. In the UK, a carbon price floor was introduced in 2013 at a rate of only \u00a316 per tonne, and rose to \u00a318.08 (\u20ac20.40), which has managed to drive almost all of the UK\u2019s coal plants out of the electricity market in recent years. Coal power made up about 2% of electricity last year compared with around half of all power generation a decade ago.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/global-pollution-price-could-cut-greenhouse-gases-by-12-says-report", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:22:01Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Radioactive material and pesticides among new contaminants found in US tap water", "article": "Water utilities and regulators in the US have identified 56 new contaminants in drinking water over the past two years, a list that includes dangerous substances linked to a range of health problems such as cancer, reproductive disruption, liver disease and much more. The revelation is part of an analysis of the nation\u2019s water utilities\u2019 contamination records by the Environmental Working Group, a clean water advocate that has now updated its database for the first time since 2019. It found that the jump is partly driven by newly identified PFAS, a toxic class of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that are widely used across dozens of industries and are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 100 million people. Pesticides, water disinfectant byproducts and radioactive materials are among other substances identified by regulators. Though the new contaminant list is disturbing, it would be much longer if regulators and utilities were properly monitoring the nation\u2019s water supply, said the EWG senior scientist Tasha Stoiber. \u201cIt speaks to the fact that we don\u2019t have nearly strong enough regulations in place to protect drinking water, and the regulation process is much too slow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re testing for things that are already in our drinking water after the fact \u2026 and we\u2019re not keeping pace with these chemicals.\u201d The list includes some substances that have been in production and used for years, but are only now being monitored by regulators as their links to health problems become clear. Other contaminants include those that industry is only beginning to use in larger quantities. Many of the substances were identified as part of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s unregulated contaminant monitoring rule (UMCR), which is one of the first steps in the regulation process. It tracks chemicals\u2019 presence in some water systems and its aim is to provide the EPA with a picture of how widespread a chemical\u2019s contamination is before new limits are established. Among other substances detected is HAA-9, a byproduct of the drinking water disinfection process. Regulators previously set limits for HAA-5, a contaminant in the same family that was found to cause health problems. Industry claimed HAA-9 was safe, but recent studies linked it to low birthrate, so the EPA is beginning to track it. However, setting limits can be a lengthy process, and the EPA has failed to set a new limit under the UMCR in the 20 years since the rule was implemented. The agency found what Stoiber characterized as \u201ceye-opening\u201d levels of PFAS compounds in 2013 yet is aiming to set water limits for just two kinds by next year. Other contaminants in the new list were detected by states that are moving to put stricter regulations in place for chemicals, like PFAS. In the meantime, there\u2019s little that people can do beyond educating themselves about which contaminants are in their water system, buying filters and advocating for stronger regulations. EWG\u2019s database allows users to search for contaminants in water systems by zip code, and it provides a guide on which chemicals water filters can remove. \u201cEveryone can be educated,\u201d Stoiber said. \u201cContact the local utility, ask them questions about what they\u2019re doing \u2026 and push for stronger regulations that protect people\u2019s health.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/us-tap-water-contaminants-discovery-radioactive-material-pesticides", "last_update": "2021-11-02T22:43:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},

South Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, western Victoria, western New South Wales and western Queensland will see falls of up to 100mm in hard-hit areas as Australia edges closer to declaring an official La Ni\u00f1a.\nSenior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Jonathan Howe said it would be \u201cone of the wettest weeks\u201d coming into summer for every mainland state and territory as a trough extended from the Great Australian Bight to the tropics. \u201cAcross central and eastern Australia it will be muggy, rainy and stormy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery state and territory will be hit by thunderstorms and rain over the next week, with showers coming past before the storms arrive.\u201d\nHowe said Western Australia, western Queensland and New South Wales, northern Victoria and much of the Northern Territory would be hit the hardest on Thursday and Friday, before storms gradually shifted to the east coming into the weekend. The heaviest rain \u2013 between 50mm and 100mm \u2013is expected across remote Western Australia, the Kimberley and the Top End, while parts of north-east Victoria and south-east New South Wales were predicted to see rain of up to 50mm. \u201cIt depends on where the thunderstorms fall, but there are heavy rain warnings in place in northern Victoria and western New South Wales and there\u2019s already the risk of flash flooding in remote areas,\u201d Howe said. \u201cSome places are soaked already, so there is a risk of some marine flooding.\u201d Howe said an active tropical moisture front was causing the storms, with steamy waters in the north of Australia sitting at temperatures between one and three degrees hotter than normal. \u201cIt\u2019s generally in the high 20s but water is getting to 33 degrees, like a warm bath,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s causing evaporation, and the tropical moisture is dragged across continent, leading to humid days and instability.\u201d\nWhile La Ni\u00f1a hadn\u2019t been officially declared, Howe said forecasters were \u201con the cusp\u201d of doing so in the coming days or weeks, and predicted the continuation of above-average rainfall lasting into summer. \u201cYou need an above-average temperature over a consecutive period, and we\u2019re almost meeting all criteria. It\u2019s the warm waters that would lead us to declare it,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually you see weather like this at the start of the active rain and cyclone period, but what is unusual is the timing. You see this in summer, at peak warmth, but it\u2019s quite early in the season which was unexpected.\u201d Howe said one silver lining may be the lowered risk of severe bushfires like those seen during Black Summer in 2019. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIt was getting really hot [in 2019] but because we\u2019re seeing so much rain across western and central Australia, it\u2019s not giving the heat a good chance to build and we\u2019re unlikely to see big heatwaves over the next few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking to be an average season coming into summer, but that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t get any bushfires as all you need is a few hot days. \u201cThere\u2019s an above normal chance of bushfires in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales because of how dry it\u2019s been, but across eastern Victoria and New South Wales it\u2019s below normal, which comes back to the wet weather.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/storms-forecast-across-central-and-east-australia-as-la-nina-weather-event-declaration-expected", "last_update": "2021-11-03T05:18:18Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Smith claims he only had a few glasses of wine at a friend\u2019s house before deciding to drive home on Saturday night but he returned a blood-alcohol reading of more than twice the legal limit after crashing into a Hawthorn house in Melbourne\u2019s east. Speaking to reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday, Smith said it was the \u201cworst decision of his life\u201d and he had spoken to his doctor. \u201cI\u2019m not (mentally) unwell. I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredible regretful of what\u2019s occurred.\u201d The MP for Kew returned a breath test reading of 0.131, prompting the immediate suspension of his licence for 12 months.

{"title": "New Zealand gang leaders unite to urge community to get Covid shots", "article": "Seven New Zealand gang leaders, representing four of the countries most well-known street gangs, have joined forces in a video urging their communities to get vaccinated, in a concept that was conjured up by a government minister. The video was commissioned by the minister for Maori development, Willie Jackson, after a discussion with gang leaders, who then provided footage that was edited by Jackson\u2019s son, Hikurangi, the Herald reported. In the four-minute video, Denis O\u2019Reilly, who joined the Black Power gang aged 19, says he had \u201ctaken a few shots\u201d in his time, including the two shots against Covid-19, and he is asking his community \u201cto do the same\u201d. \u201cThis is not all about gangs, this is all about our wh\u0101nau (family),\u201d says Harry Tam of the Mongrel Mob. \u201cOne thing we need to be clear about is that this is not about the government telling us, it is about the experts telling the government, that is getting us to vaccinate to protect ourselves.\u201d Fellow member Dennis Makalio says it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for him.\nNew Zealand\u2019s outbreak now stands at a total of 3,634 cases and has established itself along stark ethnic lines: about 70% of infections in the current outbreak are M\u0101ori and Pacific New Zealanders, who make up about 27% of the total population combined.

{"title": "Eric Adams, former police officer, wins New York mayor\u2019s race", "article": "Former police officer Eric Adams will be the next mayor of New York City, after the Democrat defeated Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday\u2019s election. Adams was on course to easily beat Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, with a lead of 66% to 29% after more than half of projected votes were counted. Adams will now take charge of the largest city in the US in January, when he will be faced with overseeing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 34,500 New Yorkers. Adams, 61, becomes only the second Black person to be elected New York mayor, after David Dinkins, who led the city from 1990 to 1993. Adams, who defeated several progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, has pledged to cut government inefficiency and made public safety a central part of his campaign. In a speech, Adams urged unity and told his story as a working-class child who grew up to become mayor. \u201cTonight, New Yorkers have chosen one of their own,\u201d Adams, said in a victory speech. \u201cI am you.\u201d Adams urged unity. \u201cToday, we take off the intramural jersey and we put on one jersey, Team New York,\u201d he told supporters at a celebration at the New York Marriott. \u201cTonight is not just a victory over adversity, it is a vindication of faith. It is the proof that the forgotten can be the future.\u201d The centrist politician has been a disappointing choice for many progressives who hoped to see radical reforms in the criminal justice system. Adams has promised to strike a balance between fighting crime and ending racial injustice in law enforcement. After winning a contentious primary, Adams was always the favorite to defeat Sliwa, a Republican, in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans seven to one. He will replace Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat who is limited to two terms as mayor, in January. Adams was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, in 1960, and spoke during the campaign about his impoverished upbringing. He decided to join the New York City police department in an effort to change the force from within, Adams said, after being beaten by officers when he was 15 years old. He joined the police in 1984 and became a captain before leaving in 2006 to run \u2013 successfully \u2013 for state senate. During his time in the state legislature he was criticized by the New York inspector general for his role in attempting to bring a casino to a racetrack in Queens, New York City. Adams had accepted campaign contributions from a politically connected group bidding for the gambling franchise. In 2013 Adams was elected to Brooklyn borough president, a power-light position that chiefly involves championing the borough, but one which also boosted Adams\u2019s profile as he weighed a run for mayor. Adams trailed Andrew Yang, a 2020 presidential candidate, in the early months of the Democratic primary, but came through New York\u2019s ranked choice voting to edge out Kathryn Garcia, a former New York City sanitation commissioner, in July. His campaign raised eyebrows over the summer when Adams was forced to answer questions about whether he actually lives in the city he was bidding to lead, given he owns a home in New Jersey and was rarely spotted at the address in Brooklyn where he claims to reside. Adams has insisted he lives in New York City. Sliwa, a talk radio host best known for founding the Guardian Angels, a volunteer crime prevention group, in the 1970s, proved a charismatic if ultimately flawed candidate. He had been a regular presence on New York City\u2019s streets, frequently standing on top of a car-pulled float and spreading his message through a microphone and speaker. Sliwa wore his red beret throughout the campaign, including during the mayoral debates, but struggled to gain much attention in a race where Adams had long been the presumptive winner.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/02/eric-adams-wins-mayor-election-new-york-city", "last_update": "2021-11-03T02:33:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Minneapolis voters reject bid to replace police with public safety department", "article": "Voters in Minneapolis have rejected the idea of replacing their police department with a new department of public safety, more than a year after the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer launched a national movement to defund or abolish police. Floyd\u2019s murder in the summer of 2020 sparked outrage and international protests on police brutality and racial injustice. In Minneapolis and elsewhere, calls for major changes to law enforcement, including defunding police departments, soon followed. If the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council. The projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council via ordinances. Mandatory minimum police staffing would also be erased from the city charter.\nSupporters argued it was a chance to reimagine what public safety could be and how money was spent. Among other changes, supporters said, funding would have gone toward programs that did not send armed officers to call on people in crisis. The idea won wide support among many progressive groups who pointed out that it would have changed the nature of policing in the city \u2013 not gotten rid of law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s a vote for us to all reimagine public safety and to move away from the type of systems that have not produced safety for all communities,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, a spokesperson for Color of Change Pac, which organized support for the referendum. Opponents said the proposal contained no concrete plan for how to move forward and warned it would leave some communities already affected by violence more vulnerable as crime was on the rise. \u201cTonight Minneapolis voters have made clear that we want a planful approach to transforming policing and public safety in our city that needs to include meaningful consultation with the communities that are most impacted by both violent crime and by over-policing,\u201d said Leili Fatehi, manager of the All of Mpls campaign, which advocated for a \u201cno\u201d vote on the measure. The policing amendment earned the support of several prominent progressive Democrats, including the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents the Minneapolis area, and the state attorney general, Keith Ellison. But other prominent figures, including the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, and the US senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, opposed it and feared the backlash could lead to Democratic losses across the country in 2022. Rishi Khanna, 31, a tech worker, voted \u201cyes\u201d on replacing the police department, saying he didn\u2019t believe police officers were qualified to deal with many situations, such as mental health crises. He said he thought having professionals equipped to deal with a range of public safety issues in the same department as law enforcement would benefit both residents and police officers. \u201cI understand that law enforcement will have to have a seat at the table, but I think both in our community and in communities around the country, too often law enforcement is the only seat at the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right solution.\u201d Askari Lyons, 61, voted against the ballot initiative. A resident of the city\u2019s largely Black north side, he said he believed Minneapolis police officers \u201cmay have learned a lesson after George Floyd\u2019s death and what happened to the cop that killed him\u201d. Lyons called it \u201cunwise\u201d to replace the department and said he believed change within the department was imminent. \u201cPeople are so frustrated, so angry, so disappointed\u201d with the violence occurring citywide as much as they are with the city\u2019s law enforcement, he said. Minister JaNa\u00e9 Bates, a spokeswoman for the pro-amendment campaign, told reporters Monday that even if the proposal failed, the activists behind it had changed the conversation about public safety. \u201cNo matter what happens, the city of Minneapolis is going to have to move forward and really wrestle with what we cannot un-know: that the Minneapolis police department has been able to operate with impunity and has done quite a bit of harm and the city has to take some serious steps to rectify that,\u201d Bates said.

{"title": "British woman wins legal battle against Australia\u2019s \u2018backpacker tax\u2019", "article": "A British backpacker who worked as a waiter in Sydney has won a long-running legal dispute against Australia\u2019s \u201cbackpacker tax\u201d in its highest court. On Wednesday the high court ruled in favour of Catherine Addy, finding the tax which slugged working holiday-makers thousands of dollars more than Australians discriminated against her on the basis of her nationality and infringed a treaty Australia signed with the UK. The decision likely means the Australian Taxation Office will have to pay back taxes collected from up to 75,000 backpackers who worked in Australia, which has similar treaties with Chile, Finland, Japan, Norway, Turkey, Germany and Israel.\nIn December 2016 Australia legislated the backpacker tax charging working holiday-makers 15% on the first $37,000 they earn a year, a maximum liability of $5,550. Australians are entitled to a tax-free threshold for the first $18,200 they earn and are only liable to pay up to $3,572 if they earn $37,000. Addy spent nearly two years in Australia between August 2015 and May 2017, earning $26,576 as a food and beverage waiter in Sydney in the 2017 tax year. In October 2019 Addy won a challenge in the federal court arguing the tax discriminated against her on the basis of nationality and breached the Australia-UK treaty on avoidance of double taxation. In August 2020 the full federal court overturned the decision. Addy appealed to the high court, arguing that if the backpacker tax had applied for the full year she earned $26,576, she would have been slugged $3,986 compared with an Australian who would pay just $1,591. On Wednesday five justices of the high court unanimously allowed Addy\u2019s appeal, finding that \u201cmore burdensome taxation\u201d had been imposed on her due to her nationality. \u201cWhen the position of Ms Addy is compared with that of an Australian national, as it must be, that is the only conclusion which may be drawn,\u201d they said. \u201cShe did the same kind of work and earned the same amount of income from the same source; yet an Australian national was required \u2026 to pay less tax.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe ATO said the decision was \u201conly relevant\u201d to holiday-makers who were \u201cboth an Australian resident for tax purposes\u201d and from one of the eight countries with similar tax treaties. \u201cMost working holiday makers will be non-residents as they are in Australia to have a holiday and working to support that holiday,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will not change the tax rates for the majority of working holiday makers.\u201d The ATO advised employers to continue using existing withholding rates until they are updated and working holiday-makers to wait for guidance \u201cprior to lodging or amending a return or lodging an objection\u201d. Joanna Murphy, the chief executive of Taxback.com, an international tax accounting and advisory firm that helped Addy bring the case, welcomed the high court decision.\n\u201cThe court has reaffirmed important protections for foreign citizens choosing to work while holidaying in Australia,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. \u201cIt was always clear to us when this tax was introduced in 2016, against the wishes of the agricultural sector, that it breached a number of international tax agreements. \u201cIt also damaged Australia\u2019s reputation as a working holiday destination.\u201d The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said \u201cthe government is aware of the high court decision and the ATO is currently considering the implications of this decision and will provide guidance to taxpayers as soon as possible\u201d. In a statement, Labor shadow ministers labelled the backpacker tax \u201cill-conceived and rushed\u201d, arguing it had contributed to \u201chuge workforce shortage challenges which the Morrison-Joyce government is still yet to fix\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/british-waitress-wins-legal-battle-against-australias-backpacker-tax", "last_update": "2021-11-03T05:47:49Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Hong Kong protests: filmmakers decry new law that could censor a moment in history", "article": "When the DVD came back shattered, it felt like a sign. The creators of Hong Kong protest documentary, Inside the Red Brick Wall, had sent it to regulators for a screening approval, as they\u2019d done numerous times before without issue. But this time the returning envelope was filled with silver shards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand why, but it was intentional,\u201d one of the anonymous creators says. \u201cThey said it was broken by the DVD machine but it was intentional \u2013 it came back in pieces. It felt intentional, like they were sending a message.\u201d The screening was approved, but with a higher rating restricting audiences to people aged 18 and over. But the moment marked a significant shift.\nA few months later, in March, the theatre hosting the first commercial screening of the protest film cancelled on the day. Then the government-backed funding body, the Arts Development Council of Hong Kong, reportedly withdrew a major grant from the independent film collective that had released it. The incidents underline the growing intolerance from authorities to anything related to the pro-democracy movement, which wracked the city for much of 2019. In June 2020, Beijing imposed its national security law which vaguely criminalised acts as foreign collusion, sedition, secession or terrorism. Since then police have used it to arrest hundreds of journalists, politicians, campaigners and activists, and make risky the selling of particular books, artworks, and films. \u2018Clear political censorship\u2019 On Wednesday last week, Hong Kong\u2019s parliament criminalised politically sensitive film-making, with a law allowing broad censorship under the guise of national security. The new law bans any films the government deems could \u201cendorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security\u201d, and allows officials to stop productions and screenings. Any unauthorised screening of a banned film can incur three years in jail for those responsible, or a $1m fine. \u201cThe goal is very clear: it\u2019s to improve the film censorship system, to prevent any act endangering the national security,\u201d commerce secretary Edward Yau told the Legislative Council. Kenny Ng, associate professor at the Academy of Film at Hong Kong Baptist University told Reuters the bill was \u201cheavy-handed\u201d. \u201cAdding national security clauses to the bill is clear political censorship,\u201d he said. Obvious targets of the law are the rush of protest documentaries released in the past 12 months. The documentaries show some of the protest movement\u2019s most violent moments and follow individuals including some who were later arrested. Many were made by anonymous teams of likeminded people who met while filming on the frontlines of protests, and were inspired to tell a deeper story than international media.\n\u201cI think that was the moment I personally felt like this is the time we should start doing what a documentary film-maker should do,\u201d says Iris Kwong, one of seven directors behind When A City Rises, which screened at the Brisbane International Film Festival over the weekend. \u201c[Before then] I wasn\u2019t going to make any films about the movement because it was something I felt like the whole world was already coming in to, so maybe I didn\u2019t need to do it. It was a moment where I just wanted to be together with the rest of the city in this social movement.\u201d Several film-makers tell the Guardian the new law doesn\u2019t affect them much more than the national security law already did. Some have already gone to ground, working anonymously, while others have fled Hong Kong. \u2018Risks to everybody involved\u2019 The biggest impact of the new censorship law, several say, will be on Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international film hub and the city\u2019s rich catalogue of lauded, thoughtful and often political films. Last week\u2019s law allows Hong Kong\u2019s security chief, John Lee Ka-chiu, to ban the screening of existing films if he determines they threaten national security. The one most often cited as a likely target is the 2015 film 10 Years, a dystopian and rather prophetic imagining of Hong Kong\u2019s future, but there are many others. \u201cWe have so many films critical of governments, especially from before 1997 when we were still a colony of Britain,\u201d says the Inside the Red Brick Wall film-maker. \u201cIt was OK to criticise the Chinese government at that time and many of our famous and iconic films are from before or around that time. So it would be a huge thing if they decided to ban those films too, because they\u2019re very culturally significant.\u201d Many local productions were already partnering commercially with mainland Chinese companies, and there had been a trend towards complying with mainland sensitivities, some of the film-makers note. But what was once an issue of resources is now a matter of law.\n\u201cWith Hong Kong being a hub for film-making, and most of which are really expensive to make, if your movie gets pulled that\u2019s really bad,\u201d says Kwong. \u201cSo I think what will happen is the impact of this law will mean more self-censorship for non-political films.\u201d The Inside the Red Brick Wall film-maker says even in hindsight she and her team still would have made their film. When A City Rises won\u2019t screen in Hong Kong because \u201cthere are risks to everybody involved\u201d, says Kwong, but it will be shown in Australia and several European countries over coming months. Kwong hopes the film will help global audiences understand what happened in Hong Kong. \u201cI think with any social movements around the world, there often isn\u2019t a tonne that people can do, but what is worse is when people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s happening.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/hong-kong-protests-filmmakers-decry-new-law-that-could-censor-a-moment-in-history", "last_update": "2021-11-03T00:23:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Newcastle close to landing Unai Emery but manager insists \u2018no offer\u2019 made yet", "article": "Unai Emery is close to returning to the Premier League as Newcastle\u2019s new manager after the club\u2019s Saudi Arabian-led owners identified the Villarreal coach as their preferred choice to succeed Steve Bruce. Although negotiations concerning Emery\u2019s proposed salary are ongoing, there is cautious optimism at St James\u2019 Park that the former Sevilla, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain coach will be in place for the trip to Brighton on Saturday.\nEmery, who turns 50 on Wednesday, is due to take charge of Villlarreal at home against Young Boys in the Champions League on Tuesday night. With Newcastle happy to pay his employers about \u00a36m in compensation, he and his advisers have been talking to Amanda Staveley and her fellow directors via Zoom since the weekend. Staveley, who runs the club on a day-to-day basis, interviewed a number of candidates but, along with her Saudi overlords and fellow director Jamie Reuben, has been left most impressed by Emery and his track record. Should he sign, his arrival on an anticipated three-year contract with a salary in the region of the \u00a37m a year he commanded at Arsenal will be regarded as a coup for Staveley. The Spaniard not only lifted the Europa League with Villarreal last season after beating Manchester United on penalties in the final but won the competition three years in a row with Sevilla from 2014 to 2016. He subsequently won the French league with PSG before struggling as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s successor during a short spell at Arsenal when the team finished fifth in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Chelsea in 2019.\nAt Newcastle, the man who led a Villarreal side, now sitting a modest 13th in La Liga, to their first major trophy would face a very different challenge. Newcastle are still to win a match and sit 19th after 10 Premier League games. Following Villarreal\u2019s 2-0 win against Young Boys, Emery said: \u201cThe only thing that is true is that I have been told of their [Newcastle\u2019s] interest and I pretty much don\u2019t have more news than that. There is no offer, which in any case would have to come via the club. So there\u2019s no more beyond that [which would make] me say I\u2019m going.\u201d He added: \u201cI do not open or close the door. I am waiting and I would talk to Fernando [Roig, the Villarreal president] and the club, for whom I have respect. My dedication is where I am.\u201d When asked on Tuesday about a Newcastle approach for Emery, Roig said: \u201cI have absolutely no idea. What I do know is that he has a contract with us and contracts are there to be fulfilled. I expect Unai\u2019s professionalism and I have no doubt about that.\u201d Roig, pressed on his calm response, said: \u201cThe important thing is that fans can\u2019t be bought. They don\u2019t go to Newcastle or Man United. Loads and loads of players and coaches have been and gone \u2026 you\u2019re always prepared for what might come. We fans are always here. What matters is that the feeling for Villarreal remains.\u201d\nWith another 10 league fixtures due before the January transfer window Bruce\u2019s successor faces a tricky, fairly high-risk challenge. Should the Emery deal founder, the indications are the club would turn to Eddie Howe after the former Bournemouth manager impressed in interviews. Although the Saudis have plenty of money to spend \u2013 including scope to invest almost \u00a3200m on players in January \u2013 the short-term priority is to avoid relegation. After the 3-0 home defeat by Chelsea last Saturday the Newcastle caretaker Graeme Jones, who is set to remain on the staff, conceded the team were in a relegation fight. Emery will appreciate that joining Newcastle will involve not only turning his back on European football but working with a limited squad alarmingly over-reliant on Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin for goals and inspiration. It is the sort of role as capable of breaking a manager\u2019s reputation as making it but Emery, seemingly still stung by his sacking from Arsenal in November 2019, is said to believe he has unfinished business in England\u2019s top tier. He will, though, be keen to know the identity of the director of football Staveley is also seeking and plans for building the training ground that is urgently required. Newcastle\u2019s owners must trust that Emery\u2019s profile and contacts will help them recruit the type of player capable of leading the team out of the bottom half of the table and, eventually, towards brighter European horizons.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/newcastle-close-to-landing-unai-emery-as-manager-from-villarreal", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:51:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Uber pledged last year that 50% of miles driven in seven European capitals by the end of 2025 will be in battery electric cars. The vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions, helping to address the impacts on health and the climate caused by urban transport. There were stark divergences among different European capitals. The usage of electric cars ranged from 9% of miles driven in Lisbon, to 6% in London and Amsterdam, and only 0.01% in Brussels, according to internal Uber data shared with Transport & Environment (T&E), a thinktank. The other laggards were Madrid, at only 0.15% of miles, Berlin at 0.55% and Paris at 1%. However, Uber\u2019s data showed rapid increases in electric miles in some cities. In London only 1.6% of miles driven were electric in the first half of 2020, meaning the share more than tripled in the year since. In Berlin the share of electric miles fell during the same period. Uber faces a difficult task in electrifying quickly because the cars are bought by drivers. On Wednesday it announced that London Uber drivers could put money raised via the app\u2019s clean air fee towards buying Tesla electric cars, adding to similar programmes giving discounts on Nissan, Kia and Hyundai electric cars.\nT&E said the divergent paths taken by different cities highlighted the need for local and national regulations to promote electric cars. Saul Lopez, electric fleets programme manager at T&E, said: \u201cUber should be doing more but so should governments. In Amsterdam and London it\u2019s cleaning up its fleet faster because the authorities have set up electrification mandates and effective ultra-low emissions zones.\u201d Uber, headquartered in San Francisco, introduced its 2025 target following criticism of its environmental credentials, along with rivals such as Bolt and Lyft. Uber is aiming for 100% electric cars worldwide by 2040. A taxi ride generally uses more energy than the same trip via public transport, although Uber and other ride-hailing companies argue they will contribute to lowering emissions through a more efficient transport system. Anabel Diaz, a regional general manager for Uber, backed the call for government action to promote the use of electric vehicles. She added: \u201cThese first steps towards our ambitious electrification commitments were always going to be the most challenging given the pandemic, but drivers in Europe are switching to EVs well ahead of the average European consumer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/03/electric-cars-under-5-per-cent-miles-driven-uber-europe", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:16:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "MoD wasting billions with \u2018broken\u2019 procurement system, MPs warn", "article": "The Ministry of Defence\u2019s system of procurement is \u201cbroken\u201d and is repeatedly wasting billions in taxpayers\u2019 money, according to a scathing assessment by a watchdog committee of MPs. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the oversight in the department was so poor that it was unable to spell out what additional capability the country will get from an extra \u00a316.5bn which was allocated by Boris Johnson last year. Of the current 20 largest projects, 13 were running behind, by a cumulative total of 21 years \u2013 including the \u00a34bn-plus Ajax armoured vehicle, delayed due to excessive noise and vibration. There is \u201cno timescale\u201d when it will be ready for service. No firm figure was put on the amount of money lost, but the MPs said there had been \u201cwastage of taxpayers\u2019 money running into the billions\u201d and that the MoD at times \u201clacks the skilled personnel\u201d to manage its suppliers. \u201cThe department\u2019s system for delivering major equipment capabilities is broken,\u201d the committee added. Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said: \u201cThis committee is determined that this state of affairs cannot, and will not, continue\u201d \u2013 and demanded that the Treasury conduct an emergency review of MoD project management. The senior MP said that PAC members feared that \u201clast year\u2019s lauded and substantial uplift\u201d of \u00a316.5bn over four years would \u201csimply be used to plug financial holes across its programmes\u201d because the MoD could not give assurances to the contrary. The prime minister announced the extra capital spending nearly a year ago, promising it would lead to \u201ca once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces\u201d \u2013 including the introduction of laser weapons. But at the time the MoD also faced a \u00a313bn shortfall in its equipment budget, stemming from historic overspending, which had forced it to reduce the numbers of new Challenger 3 tanks, P-8 submarine hunting maritime patrol aircraft and Type 26 frigates. A total of \u00a34bn had already been spent on the heavily delayed Ajax out of \u201cwhole life costs of \u00a35.5bn,\u201d the committee noted, yet only 14 vehicles \u2013 2% of the total requirement \u2013 had been delivered by contractor General Dynamics for testing. One year ago, the MoD thought Ajax would initially enter service in the summer of 2021 \u2013 but this date was not met and the issues over vibration and noise are so serious that 310 service personnel were undergoing tests to see if their hearing had been permanently damaged. The noise and vibration problems dated back to December 2018 but the MPs voiced concern that the MoD was still in the dark about the cause. \u201cDespite the length of time the department has known about this issue, there is still no definitive information on the source of the noise and vibration,\u201d the PAC said. Eight programmes were rated either \u201camber/red or red\u201d by senior officials responsible for delivering them on a traffic light scheme used across government for rating the progress of major procurement projects. Of broader concern, the PAC said, was the MoD\u2019s apparent inability to learn from its mistakes despite 13 formal reviews of defence procurement over 35 years. \u201cWe were therefore shocked to learn that the department had only established a central register of learning from experience (LFE) in December 2020,\u201d the MPs added. \u201cExperience shows that there is a need for reflection and openness earlier in the process to avoid further catastrophes like Ajax.\u201d The MoD frequently cited the complexity of the programmes to explain why they had fallen behind, but sceptical MPs said this was not the case. Such arguments aimed to \u201cexcuse the fact\u201d that the MoD and its suppliers \u201cfailed to produce more realistic costings and schedules\u201d, the committee concluded. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cThis report reflects the complex challenges of delivering defence capability for our armed forces, but also the commitment and professionalism required to keep our people and the UK\u2019s interests safe, by purchasing world-class equipment such as Lightning II stealth fighter jets, and the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carriers.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/03/mod-wasting-billions-with-broken-procurement-system-mps-warn", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:25:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Women under 35 face higher risk of breast cancer spreading \u2013 study", "article": "Women diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 35 face a higher risk of it spreading, according to the first global study of its kind. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer, with 2.3 million people diagnosed every year. Survival rates are generally good, which is largely because of screening, early diagnosis and improved treatment. However, until now, little has been known about the risk of secondary breast cancer, where the disease spreads to other parts of the body and becomes incurable. A meta analysis of more than 400 studies has found the risk of breast cancer spreading to another part of the body ranges from 6% to 22%. The results of the study are being presented at the sixth International Consensus Conference for Advanced Breast Cancer . The findings also suggest certain women face a higher risk, including those diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 35, those with larger tumours when initially diagnosed and those with specific types of the disease, for example luminal B. Kotryna Temcinaite, senior research communications manager at the charity Breast Cancer Now, said the analysis \u201cprovides helpful insight into who is most at risk\u201d. \u201cAbout 1,000 women in the UK die each month from incurable secondary breast cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe desperately need to learn more about this devastating disease so that we can find new ways to improve treatment, care and support for people living with it, and for those living in fear of a diagnosis. \u201cThe data shows that people diagnosed with primary breast cancer aged 35 years or younger have the greatest chance of developing secondary breast cancer. The study also highlights that the size of the tumour, the type of breast cancer and the length of time since primary diagnosis can impact a person\u2019s risk. \u201cSecondary breast cancer can develop many years after an initial cancer diagnosis, so it\u2019s vital that we understand it better and find new ways to prevent it.\u201d For the study, researchers analysed data on tens of thousands of women across more than 400 studies from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The analysis suggests the overall risk of metastasis for most breast cancer patients is between 6% and 22%. Researchers say the range is broad because the risk varies significantly depending on a whole range of different factors. For example, women first diagnosed under the age of 35 have a 12.7% to 38% risk of their breast cancer coming back and spreading to other parts of the body, while women aged 50 years or older have a risk of 3.7% to 28.6%. \u201cThis may be because younger women have a more aggressive form of breast cancer or because they are being diagnosed at a later stage,\u201d said the presenter of the study, Dr Eileen Morgan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). \u201cBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMost women are diagnosed when their cancer is confined to the breast or has only spread to nearby tissue. But in some women, the cancer will grow and spread to other parts of the body or come back in a different part of the body several years after the end of their initial treatment. \u201cAt this point the cancer becomes much harder to treat and the risk of dying is higher. However, we don\u2019t really know how many people develop metastatic breast cancer because cancer registries have not been routinely collecting this data.\u201d The study also found women with specific types of breast cancer appeared to have a higher risk of it spreading, for example those with a type of cancer called luminal B. Those with this form had a 4.2% to 35.5% risk of it spreading compared with 2.3% to 11.8% risk in women diagnosed with luminal A cancer. Dr Shani Paluch-Shimon, a member of the conference\u2019s scientific committee and director of the breast unit at Hadassah University hospital in Israel, who was not involved with the research, said the findings were \u201cvital\u201d for patients and doctors.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/03/women-under-35-face-higher-risk-of-breast-cancer-spreading-study", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:18:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},

This year the DreamToys list, drawn up by the Toy Retailers Association, is heavily influenced by spin-offs from major films and TV shows with trucks, figurines and Lego sets inspired by Star Wars, Jurassic World and Paw Patrol all making the cut. Nearly \u00a31bn will be spent on toys between now and Christmas Eve and Gary Grant, the chair of the DreamToys selection committee, said the toy industry was working hard to overcome the supply chain crisis and ensure \u201cthere will be toys on shelves\u201d throughout the festive period.\nThe Hot Wheels brand has been around for decades but fans are always eager to up the ante, with the \u00a355 \u201cmassive loop mayhem\u201d offering a more than 70cm-wide stunt track. With families also keen on games they can play together, the \u00a325 game Gassy Gus is tipped for big things. Players take turns to feed Gus, who has an inflating belly, but you do not want him to let rip on your turn. To satisfy younger children there is a \u00a345 transforming car that had a starring role in the recent Paw Patrol movie as well as toys linked to other hit children\u2019s TV shows CoComelon and Bluey. The average price across the dozen toys is \u00a336. Another predicted bestseller is the Magic Mixies Cauldron, which has been described as the \u201cwow toy of 2021\u201d. The set, which costs \u00a370, comes with a wand, spell book, potions and interactive toy, and manufacturers expect to sell 70,000 in the UK in the last three months of 2021. Grant, who is also the chair of The Entertainer toy chain, said that while toy shop shelves looked full now, with the biggest sales weeks of the year still to come, the industry\u2019s stock levels would soon be depleted.\n\u201cThere is no obvious shortage of toys in the industry today but you have to bear in mind that from the first week in November through to Christmas Eve we have roughly 40% of the annual toy industry turnover,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, really intense period.\u201d Grant said that come December more of the must-have toys than usual would be hard to come by. There would be no shortage of toys, he said, however a greater number of the must-haves \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to buy\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to panic but we are saying if children have already made up their mind what they want it would be prudent to buy earlier than later,\u201d he added.

{"title": "Art for bees: \u2018mad-looking\u2019 installation suits pollinators\u2019 tastes", "article": "She admits that, to the human eye at least, her new installation may turn out a little garish \u2013 clashing colours, odd shapes, curious juxtapositions \u2013 but the artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg doesn\u2019t mind that at all. Ginsberg\u2019s 55-metre long piece, which is taking shape at the eco-visitor attraction the Eden Project in Cornwall, is not designed, like most art, to please humans, but rather to appeal to bees, butterflies, moths, wasps and other endangered pollinators. \u201cIt means that I\u2019ve ended up with this mad-looking design,\u201d said Ginsberg in a break from the chilly, muddy business of autumn planting. \u201cThere are strange juxtapositions of shapes and patterns and colours that no gardener would think of planting. It is designed to be of greatest benefit to pollinators, suiting their tastes rather than ours.\u201d The piece, Pollinator Pathmaker, should be in full bloom by late spring or early summer and new editions of the work are to be planted in London and Berlin. Ginsberg was originally trying to dream up a piece on pollinators when the thought struck her: \u201cWhy not create a sculpture for the pollinators rather than about them?\u201d At Eden, Ginsberg has worked with professional gardeners, experts in pollination and a master beekeeper, Rodger Dewhurst, but a surprising team member is the string theory physicist Przemek Witaszczyk, of Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, who helped create an algorithm for the piece. Witaszczyk factored in elements such as the shape and style of journeys taken by different pollinators and when individual flowers come into bloom to make sure conditions are good for as long as possible. \u201cWe want to serve the greatest number of pollinators,\u201d said Ginsberg.\nHorticulturists, students, apprentices and volunteers have braved dismal conditions to plant thousands of plants, which will erupt into crazy colours at the Eden Project\u2019s Wild Edge Zone, stretching around the perimeter slopes of the gardens and visible from across the site. Another crucial element of the project is the launch on Wednesday of a website allowing people to use the algorithm to design their own unique version of her work. Users can input the size of the patch they want to plant, the position of their garden and soil conditions, then see a 3D visualisation of their unique garden bloom on their screen. The images that emerge are in themselves a work of art, each plant hand-painted by Ginsberg. Some of the specimens included on the site are as extraordinary as the pollinators that will benefit from them, such as Echium pininana, a rare example of a plant that produces nectar across the whole day, and Cynara cardunculus, the artichoke thistle, which is a valuable source of nectar for bumblebees. Ginsberg sees this as \u201can international cultural campaign\u201d and an \u201cinterspecies art experiment\u201d to help save endangered species of pollinating insects. She hopes people will grow these in whatever space they have available \u2013 at home, in fields, community gardens, even in a window box if this is all the space they have. The artist admits the gardens could be expensive if they covered a large, intensively planted area, but the cost could be kept down in more modest schemes. \u201cI hope we can create the largest ever climate-positive artwork together by planting living artworks for pollinators around the world.\u201d The Pollinator Pathmaker project is part of Create a Buzz, a three-year programme for the Eden Project that includes new plantings of fields of wild flowers and a range of community and education projects. Misha Curson, senior curator at the Eden Project, described Pollinator Pathmaker as a \u201cmould-breaking commission\u201d, combining technology, conservation, horticulture and visual arts. \u201cIt\u2019s a really powerful way of helping us as human beings think beyond our own needs and wants and consider the impact of our actions,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/03/art-for-bees-mad-looking-installation-suits-pollinators-tastes", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:55:20Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ministers launch TV ad campaign to tackle care worker shortage", "article": "Ministers have launched a three-week TV advertising blitz to recruit care workers, as a new mandatory Covid vaccination law takes effect that some operators warn could force out a quarter of their staff. The campaign will run from Wednesday on ITV, Channel 4 and Sky to help fill 105,000 vacancies with people who embody \u201ckindness, compassion and resilience\u201d, said Sajid Javid, the health secretary.\nThe launch comes amid a staffing crisis in social care, with burnout, Brexit and low pay fuelling the exodus of staff and forcing care operators to cut their bed capacity. Frontline care home staff will be required to have two Covid jabs from 11 November or face redundancy. A similar policy is being considered for homecarers and on Tuesday the Homecare Association said some members have warned it would reduce their staff rosters by over 25%. Of 150 homecare providers surveyed, 90% thought recruitment would become harder and over 80% thought they would need to dismiss staff as a result. A quarter of homecare workers have still not had two doses of vaccine. \u201cThis creates a serious risk that homecare will not be available for tens of thousands of older and disabled people who are wholly reliant on support,\u201d said Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of the industry body. With the hospitality industry and retailers including Amazon luring care workers with better wages, unions have argued a pay increase from the current \u00a39.01 median hourly wage is needed to boost recruitment. Many care managers have also seen staff switch to the NHS. The advertising campaign uses the slogan \u201cmade with care\u201d and shows care workers taking people on trips to the seaside, exercising, swimming and getting dressed. A voiceover says: \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to become a care worker\u201d. Recruitment is not just a short-term problem. An ageing population means 500,000 further new care staff will be needed by 2035. \u201cWe are investing record amounts into social care making this an exciting time to join the workforce and play an important role in helping to develop a world-leading social care system as we bring forward our plans for reform later this year,\u201d said care minister Gillian Keegan.\nBut the shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said: \u201cIn the face of overwhelming staff shortages, social care needs a detailed plan to transform staff pay, training and terms and conditions more than this TV advertising drive. There will be no new money for social care from the government\u2019s so-called levy for at least three years, and nothing in the budget except confirmation of a national insurance hike on the very frontline workers we need to recruit.\u201d Gavin Edwards, national officer for care at the trade union Unison, said: \u201cIf the government is serious about recruitment, its first move should be to ensure care workers get a decent pay rise. Any ad campaign pushing a job without sick pay, where poor treatment and exploitation are rife, will struggle to succeed.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/03/ministers-launch-tv-ad-campaign-to-tackle-care-worker-shortage", "last_update": "2021-11-03T08:27:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "World\u2019s biggest banks to play a role in limiting greenhouse gas emissions", "article": "Hundreds of the world\u2019s biggest banks and pension funds with assets worth $130tn have committed themselves to a key goal in limiting greenhouse gas emissions, the UK government will announce on Wednesday. The pledge by more than 450 financial institutions in 45 countries is intended to be one of the top achievements by the UK hosts of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, and comes as some of the other aims of the summit \u2013 chiefly, setting the world on a path to limit global heating to 1.5C \u2013 are looking hard to reach. Finance is key to the massive economic transformation required to move away from fossil fuels and reach net zero so the global economy can be run without damaging the climate. But experts and campaigners cast doubt on the government\u2019s finance claims, pointing out that the banks making the pledge are still free to pour cash into fossil fuels, and need only divert a small slice of their funding to low-carbon ends in the next decade. News of the pledge came at the end of the second full day of the Cop26 conference in Glasgow as world leaders finished their addresses and negotiators were preparing to thrash out details that could form the basis of a final communique next weekend. On another frantic day of announcements, the key developments included: UK prime minister Boris Johnson said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reaching a deal to keep the 1.5C target on track. Returning to a football analogy in which he had said the world was the equivalent of 5-1 down, he declared on Monday evening that the score was now \u201cmore like 5-2 or 5-3\u201d. US president Joe Biden announced a plan by 90 countries to control methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Under the agreement, which does not include major emitters Russia and China, emissions of methane would fall 30% by the end of the decade. In another multinational deal, more than 40 countries including the UK, US, EU, India, China and Australia signed up to a plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies around the world. By collaborating on things like hydrogen production and electric vehicles, the members of the Breakthrough Alliance hope to bring forward the \u201ctipping point\u201d at which green technology is more affordable than fossil-fuel technology. The group of countries with the most ambitious climate targets, known as the High Ambition Coalition, were boosted by the announcement that the US would be rejoining their ranks after withdrawing from the Paris agreement entirely under former president Donald Trump. Observers said the move would strengthen efforts to stay on track for the target of 1.5C of heating. On Tuesday night, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the City of London would become the world\u2019s first \u201cnet zero finance centre\u201d, and set out new rules forcing public companies to report on their plans to achieve net zero emissions. He said: \u201cI\u2019m proud that under the UK\u2019s leadership, the number of financial firms committed to net zero plans has tripled, with the assets now covered totalling $130tn. Harnessing the trillions of dollars controlled by these companies in the fight against climate change is crucial. So I\u2019ve announced new requirements for firms to publish their net zero transition plans. Together we can provide the cash the world needs to stop catastrophic climate change.\u201d The finance pledge, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), will mean that by 2050 all of the assets under management by the institutions involved will be aligned with net zero emissions. Economists have estimated that about $100tn in investment is likely to be needed in the next three decades to meet the net zero goal, so in theory GFANZ will provide more than enough cash to meet the goal. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, now a UK and UN climate envoy, said: \u201cThe architecture of the global financial system has been transformed to deliver net zero. We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account \u2026 [This] rapid, and large-scale, increase in capital commitment to net zero, through GFANZ, makes the transition to a 1.5C world possible.\u201d But experts told the Guardian the claims were overblown. The $130tn figure refers to the assets the firms have under management, only a small proportion of which \u2013 about a third \u2013 will be devoted to low-carbon investments in the crucial next decade, when emissions must be halved to keep temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Simon Youel of the Positive Money campaign group said: \u201cBanks may be preparing to scale up investment in \u2018green\u2019 activities, but this announcement says nothing about financial firms\u2019 investments in new fossil fuel projects. States must introduce restrictions against new fossil fuel investments if we are to have a chance of keeping 1C alive.\u201d Sunak has been accused of blocking green measures and is said to oppose the net zero agenda within government. He barely mentioned the climate in his recent comprehensive spending review, his budgets have contained few green measures and many high-carbon policies, and his speech in Glasgow is virtually the first time he has acknowledged Cop26. Sam Alvis, head of economy at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: \u201cIt is definite progress that the chancellor has got the Treasury on the pitch at Cop26. But trillions of dollars are still flowing to fossil fuels every day and voluntary measures have not got us far enough. To keep the 1.5C target alive, governments will need to regulate companies not just to publish transition plans but have strict criteria with legal bite on their credibility and pace.\u201d Given the failure of wealthy nations to live up to their finance promises, diplomats from other parts of the world have turned the credibility tables on the donors. The foreign secretary of India, Harsh Vardhan Shringla said it was time for rich nations to face the same credibility checks on finance that developing countries are expected to accept on emissions cuts. \u201cThere are a lot of commitments that are made, but not seen through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure on climate action should be equal to the pressure on climate finance. It is not enough just to set the targets, there also needs to be a means to deliver. There should be tangible timelines, tangible monitoring.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/worlds-biggest-banks-to-play-a-role-in-limiting-greenhouse-gas-emissions", "last_update": "2021-11-02T22:40:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "MoD procurement disasters, delays and overspends", "article": "The last decade and a half has seen a string of procurement disasters at the Ministry of Defence, where schemes have had to be scrapped, costs overrun or plans deemed vital to national security delayed. Warrior armoured vehicle \u2013 \u00a3430m wasted A long planned upgrade to the Warrior armoured vehicle was scrapped in March, after \u00a3430m had been spent on an attempt to upgrade the weapon and turret of the vehicle. Lacking a stabilised gun, the Warrior could not fire while moving, identified as a major problem as long ago as during the first Gulf war. The procurement programme began in 2009 and a contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin in 2011. But despite spending over half of the allocated budget of \u00a3800m, no manufacturing contract was ever awarded. When scrapped the upgrade had a planned in-service date of 2024 \u2013 seven years late. The programme was described as an \u201cabject failure\u201d by the Commons defence select committee in March \u2013 which was \u201csymptomatic of the extremely weak management of army equipment programmes \u2026 in recent years\u201d. HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carriers \u2013 \u00a32.5bn overspend The cost of building two largest ships in the history of the Royal Navy soared from an initial estimate of \u00a33.9bn \u2013 when the project was commissioned under Labour in 2007 \u2013 to \u00a36.4bn. A \u201cpain sharing\u201d agreement had to be signed by the MoD in 2013 with contractors \u2013 BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales \u2013 in which the total budget was first increased to \u00a36bn, before ending up at \u00a36.4bn. But in procuring the carriers \u2013 both of which have now been accepted into service \u2013 the MoD had to make cuts. The original plan was to equip both vessels with catapult launchers for aircraft, but they were abandoned on grounds of cost, leaving the new UK ships lagging behind capabilities boasted by the US and China. A further \u00a310.5bn has been set aside to equip the carriers with F35 Lightning II jets from Lockheed Martin, although approved budget has increased four times since 2017, by a total of \u00a31.4bn. Meanwhile, a related Crowsnest radar system for the carriers and allied ships is 29 months late because, the National Audit Office said, \u201cneither the department nor industry understood the complexities of delivering the capability\u201d. Dreadnought nuclear submarines \u2013 seven years delay Britain\u2019s \u00a331bn replacement for its ageing Vanguard class Trident nuclear submarines has been plagued by delay since first approved in 2007. The first submarine was initially due to come into service in 2024, then 2028, and now the \u201cearly 2030s\u201d according to the MoD. The four existing Vanguard submarines, each carrying Britain\u2019s independent nuclear submarines, were originally built to last 25 years, meaning they would have been out of service between 2017 and 2024. Their life has been guaranteed by a series of extensions, but they will have to last well over 30 years. Poor management of other aspects of the nuclear weapons programme led to a \u00a31.35bn in costs, the National Audit Office found last year, when it looked at the upgrade programme for three key weapons sites in Burghfield, Berkshire, Raynesway, Derbyshire and Barrow-in-Furness The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the auditors found.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/03/mod-procurement-disasters-delays-and-overspends", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:00:08Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Europe\u2019s record summer \u2018impossible\u2019 without global heating", "article": "The heatwaves and wildfires that caused devastation in Europe this summer would not have happened without global heating, new analysis shows. The summer of 2021 was the hottest on record in the continent, with average temperatures about 1C above normal. The elevated heat caused wildfires and premature deaths. Researchers have calculated how much more likely the climate crisis made the high temperatures. For almost all of the past 150 years, the expected frequency of a European summer as hot as 2021 was no higher than once every 10,000 years. But since the 1990s, as carbon emissions continued to soar, the expected frequency has rocketed to reach once every three years. The analysis is a stark reminder to the leaders meeting at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow that global heating is causing terrible damage to lives and livelihoods. If countries do not achieve drastic reductions in carbon emissions by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050, the record heat of 2021 will strike every year by the end of the century, the scientists say. Despite the extraordinary increase in likelihood of record heat in recent years, Nikos Christidis at the Met Office, who led the analysis, said: \u201cThese kinds of results are no longer surprising. Climate change is already making our weather extremes more severe.\u201d \u201cExtreme events are the new norm,\u201d said Prof Petteri Taalas, the head of the UN World Meteorological Organization. A European temperature record of 48.8C was set in Sicily in August. \u201cCop26 is a make-or-break opportunity to put us back on track,\u201d Taalas said.\nThe analysis used 14 climate models and scores of model runs to calculate how frequently the record summer of 2021 is expected to occur in today\u2019s human-influenced climate, compared with a climate with no human influence. The research analysed the period from June to August and covered all of Europe, as far east as Yekaterinburg in Russia. For large stretches of the 20th century, the estimated frequency of such a hot summer in a world without climate change was more than one in 10,000 years. \u201cThis event was so rare, it was nearly impossible to calculate a probability,\u201d Christidis said. The same scientific approach has shown clear links between global heating and other severe weather. The record-breaking heatwave in the Siberian Arctic in January and February 2020 was made at least 600 times more likely, while the terrible floods in Germany and Belgium in July were made up to nine times more likely. Prof Peter Stott, also at the Met Office, said: \u201cWe can be more confident than we have ever been about linking extreme weather events to climate change. The science is clear that the faster we reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, the more we can avoid the most severe impacts.\u201d \u201cThe new study is another stark reminder of just what 1.2C [of global heating to date] means,\u201d said Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London, who conducted the Siberian study. \u201cI really do not want to imagine the summers we\u2019d have at 2.7C.\u201d She said looking at large regions gives a stronger climate change signal than smaller areas. Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThe study shows clearly that the severe intensity of this summer\u2019s heatwave was due to man-made climate change resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities. \u201cThe cost to humans and wildlife was substantial, with heatwave conditions killing people across the continent, and the enhanced evaporation of higher temperatures turning forests into fuel for devastating wildfires. \u201cThese extreme temperature events in Europe will continue to increase in severity and frequency for at least the next 30 years, until the world reaches net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.\u201d Other previous studies have shown an extreme heatwave in 2017 that saw deadly forest fires blazing in Portugal and Spain was made 10 times more likely by global warming. In Portugal, 64 people died. Previous work has also demonstrated floods in England and France \u2013 as far back as 2000 \u2013 were made significantly more likely by global heating.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/europe-record-summer-global-heating-cop26", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:36:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Former All Blacks player Carl Hayman reveals early onset dementia diagnosis", "article": "The All Blacks have expressed their sadness in the wake of Carl Hayman\u2019s early onset dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) diagnosis at the age of 41. Hayman played 45 Tests for the All Blacks between 2001-07, during which time he was considered the best tighthead prop in the game. He became one of the world\u2019s highest paid players when he joined English club Newcastle and Toulon, winning three European titles with the French team, before retiring in 2015.\nHayman revealed to Dylan Cleaver\u2019s The Bounce the near- 450 professional games he played have taken an irreversible toll on his brain. \u201cI spent several years thinking I was going crazy. At one stage that\u2019s genuinely what I thought. It was the constant headaches and all these things going on that I couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d Hayman said. \u201cAt the time I felt indestructible. I never got injured, I trained bloody hard... but if I knew then what I know now, I don\u2019t think I would have played post the [2007] World Cup. I think I would have stopped playing.\u201d Hayman\u2019s harrowing account of the effects of his early-onset dementia detailed alcohol abuse, suicidal thoughts and erratic behaviour; the latter leading to a suspended prison sentence in France after he admitted to charges of domestic violence. Since extensive testing in England revealed his diagnosis, Hayman has joined the landmark lawsuit being prepared for 150 former professional rugby players that claims rugby\u2019s governing bodies, including World Rugby, failed to protect players from the risks caused by concussions and sub-concussions. All Blacks assistant coach John Plumtree, speaking from Rome ahead of Saturday\u2019s Test against Italy, expressed his regret at Hayman\u2019s situation. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad,\u201d Plumtree said. \u201cCarl is a 45-Test All Black and he\u2019s done a lot for New Zealand rugby. It\u2019s a real sad situation if he\u2019s struggling with dementia at such an early age. We\u2019ve got a lot of empathy for that. He\u2019s been a popular person in this environment so it\u2019s not nice to hear about those stories.\u201d Despite Hayman being the latest modern-day athlete to reveal extensive brain damage from contact sport, Plumtree believes rugby, and the All Blacks, have taken major strides in attempting to mitigate the effects of repeated head knocks. \u201cWe look at our laws now they really protect the head,\u201d Plumtree said. \u201cIt has changed a lot. There\u2019s greater awareness around it in all parts of the organisation from the top level down to us as coaches. We\u2019re trying to minimise the accidents around the head as much as we can and we know the game is under pressure to do that. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility as coaches to make sure the game is safe so parents want their kids to play. \u201cIf you look at the forwards, defence, backs, attack coach we all try and coach perfect technique whether it\u2019s the high ball, tackle situation or the breakdown. The head is a protected area. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not good for our game and we know we have to protect our players whether that\u2019s at training or during a game. I hate seeing the head injuries. If you look at this tour we\u2019ve been on we\u2019ve had a couple of injuries but we haven\u2019t had a concussion. \u201cI think we\u2019re going on the right path with the way we\u2019re looking after our athletes. If you look at the stats now hopefully they\u2019d say there\u2019s less of it. \u201cI feel sorry for Carl or any other players that are affected in this regard. I know he\u2019s a good Taranaki farming boy and that\u2019s my roots as well so it wasn\u2019t a nice article to read.\u201d\nWorld Rugby recently adopted independent concussion consultants to support the graduated return to play process in the elite game, and in September issued guidelines around reducing contact in training. These include limiting full contact to 15 minutes per week; 40 minutes of controlled contact utilising tackle shields and pads, and 30 minutes of live set piece training with lineouts, scrums and mauls at a high intensity. The recommendations could soon be mandated, with Test teams potentially obliged to follow guidelines in order to compete at the 2023 World Cup. Plumtree explained training measures the All Blacks adopt to minimise contact such as using tackle shields rather than players to practise cleanout drills, and closing the distance between contacts to reduce impact. \u201cWe\u2019re minimising the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players can train cleanout work on pads that are designed like a jackler so we\u2019re not using a body for that type of training. It\u2019s all designed to look after the players and train the perfect technique. As professional coaches we\u2019ve got that responsibility. \u201cThe head is a protected place and those types of conversations are talked about all the time in the All Blacks.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/03/former-all-blacks-player-carl-hayman-reveals-early-onset-dementia-diagnosis", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:41:50Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The centre-back only returned for the 3-0 win at Tottenham last Saturday following a groin problem and was among United\u2019s best performers as they kept only a second clean sheet of the season. Yet at the Gewiss Stadium Varane was forced off in the first half and Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cIt\u2019s a hamstring and I didn\u2019t want to take a risk. On the first assessment it doesn\u2019t look good but we will assess him again tomorrow.\u201d\nAs United\u2019s defence was again a problem against Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side the loss of Varane, for what might be a number of weeks, would be a setback. Solskj\u00e6r, though, praised the \u201cincredible\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo after he was again United\u2019s saviour when equalising twice \u2013 in added time of the first and second half \u2013 to earn what might prove an invaluable draw. It means United head Group F with seven points on goal difference from Villarreal with the Spanish club and Young Boys left to play. Ronaldo\u2019s fourth and fifth strikes of the phase cancelled out Josip Illicic\u2019s opener and Duv\u00e1n Zapata\u2019s second, which had each given Atalanta the lead. Solskj\u00e6r brushed off any concern that United are too reliant on the 36-year-old forward. \u201cWe all have our roles and responsibilities,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cCristiano is a leader in the group, he scores goals. I\u2019m sure Chicago Bulls didn\u2019t mind having Michael Jordan, either \u2013 sometimes the teams have the players they have and that\u2019s why they are Manchester United, Chicago Bulls, you come up with those moments. \u201cCristiano is getting better and better for us, he\u2019s feeling better and up to speed now \u2013 he didn\u2019t have a full pre-season. We\u2019re not happy conceding two goals. The first one I think should be offside, the second one he\u2019s maybe offside last season, it\u2019s fine margins. \u201cThe point here tonight is very important \u2013 I\u2019ve said if you win your home games and a point or two away from home then you will qualify.

{"title": "Australia puts fossil fuel company front and centre at Cop26", "article": "The Australian government has been criticised for prominently hosting a fossil fuel company at its pavilion at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The condemnation came as the Morrison government confirmed it would not join about 90 countries in backing the official launch of a global pledge to reduce emissions of methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas leaked during gas and coal extraction and released by livestock \u2013 by 30% by 2030.\nThe Australian pavilion in the Scottish Event Campus exhibition centre has been a hub of activity during the first two days of the summit. With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison\u2019s address to the conference on Monday. Space in the pavilion has been dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest\u2019s green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos. At the front of the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund. Australia\u2019s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, joined Santos\u2019 chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the pavilion to trumpet the announcement.\nThe former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was \u201ca pity\u201d Australia had not signed up to the pledge and \u201ca joke\u201d that Santos had been given prime placement. \u201cLook at the Australian stand \u2013 you\u2019ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy policy should be all about burning gas,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. \u201cThe whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. We can\u2019t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global warming now.\u201d Taylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos chief while launching the government\u2019s latest low-emissions technology statement \u2013 an annual update of its technology-driven approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority technologies chosen to get government support. The minister said Santos\u2019 CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a \u201cvery elegant project\u201d that would allow it to produce gas while reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production sites and in the development of \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen using gas. \u201cWe can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the production of hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not new, it\u2019s very, very important, it\u2019s going to be particularly important for the gas industry.\u201d Asked about the global methane pledge, he said Australia\u2019s focus was \u201cwhole of economy, all gasses\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not setting sector-specific targets and we\u2019re not setting gas-specific targets,\u201d he said. Taylor last week claimed signing up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to meet it would be to \u201cstart shooting your cattle\u201d. Bill Hare, the chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was not correct. The government\u2019s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its support for CCS technology \u2013 both burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using captured carbon dioxide to make products \u2013 includes $250m for a \u201cCCS technologies and hubs\u201d program. Australian governments have committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. The Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in Glasgow, said the Morrison government was spending Cop26 \u201cbusy hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for the gas industry\u201d. The Australian Conservation Foundation said Australia was acting \u201cshamelessly\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake, the Morrison government\u2019s preoccupation with CCS is about keeping coal and gas Australia\u2019s energy system longer, and delaying the transition to renewable energy with storage,\u201d said ACF\u2019s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean. Taylor said the government was backing renewable energy by adding \u201cultra low-cost solar\u201d as a priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said. \u201cWe welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production \u2013 green, blue \u2013 they are important,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see green growing rapidly over time, we certainly hope.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26", "last_update": "2021-11-03T07:09:09Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Boris Johnson to back bid to overturn Owen Paterson lobbying inquiry", "article": "Boris Johnson will back an unprecedented bid to overthrow an independent inquiry that found the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules. Tory MPs will be instructed by party whips on Wednesday to avoid imposing an immediate 30-day suspension on their colleague by backing a motion that argues the initial probe by the parliamentary standards commissioner was flawed. Instead, a new committee would be set up to review the evidence.\nThe body would be chaired by the Conservative backbencher John Whittingdale and consist of four other Tories, three Labour MPs and one from the Scottish National party tasked with examining ways of overhauling the standards process, including giving those accused the power of appeal and making it more consistent with the \u201cprinciples of natural justice\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, the former Commons leader, will propose the amendment during a debate on Wednesday about Paterson\u2019s conduct and it is understood the chief whip, Mark Spencer, will tell other Tory MPs to support it. Last week an investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, concluded Paterson \u201crepeatedly\u201d used his position as an MP to benefit two firms who paid him as a consultant. Her report said he worked for Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about the companies. Paterson said he was not guilty and \u201ca fair process would exonerate me\u201d. He described the process as \u201ca major contributory factor\u201d in the death of his wife, Rose, who killed herself last year. A number of MPs are supporting Paterson and trying to overturn or dilute the standards committee recommendation of a 30-day suspension from parliament. The amendment set to be proposed by Leadsom tomorrow will say that a new committee should report its findings by the start of February 2022, with a motion proposing changes to the standards committee system presented to the Commons within five days.\nOther bids will also be launched to spare Paterson a long ban from parliament that could trigger a byelection. Tory MPs Dr Julian Lewis, William Wragg and Peter Bone have proposed he face no sanction \u201con compassionate grounds\u201d related to his wife\u2019s death. Whether the amendments are selected will be a matter for the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. He will announce on Wednesday afternoon which \u2013 if any \u2013 will be voted on when MPs begin a 90-minute debate on the report into Paterson released last week. Bernard Jenkin, one of four Tory MPs who sits on the standards committee, recused himself from discussions during the investigation as he is a close friend of Paterson\u2019s. Jenkin was said to have played a role in mobilising MPs to vote to prevent his suspension. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader, has also tried to drum up support for Paterson among the 2019 intake of Tory MPs. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and chair of the standards committee, said Leadsom\u2019s amendment would be unjust. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe definition of injustice is you change the rules in the midst of the process. This would create a special system for one person and is completely unfair.\u201d His committee found Paterson broke multiple rules when he lobbied the government on behalf of Randox, a clinical diagnostics company, and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, a processor and distributor of meat products. The committee\u2019s report said: \u201cNo previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests.\u201d Paterson claimed he was acting as a whistleblower when he raised concerns about bacon and milk standards with the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development but the commissioner said his mitigation \u201cdid not meet the conditions for this exemption\u201d. On only two occasions since the second world war have suspensions been contested in the Commons, it is thought, but never has one been downgraded or removed. A senior Tory MP said: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of tempering justice with mercy. I do wonder \u2013 in the context of what he\u2019s been through \u2013 if triggering a recall petition is an appropriate sanction.\u201d Thangham Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, said if Leadsom\u2019s amendment passed, it would signal a \u201creturn to the worst of the 1990s Tory sleaze culture\u201d. She added: \u201cThe Tories want to jettison the systems that has served us well and which has been a vital part of rebuilding public trust after the dark days of Tory sleaze this government seems determined to return to.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/tories-set-to-try-to-overturn-findings-of-owen-paterson-lobbying-inquiry", "last_update": "2021-11-03T01:22:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Championship: Luton spoil Warnock\u2019s landmark night with Middlesbrough", "article": "Neil Warnock\u2019s historic night turned sour as his Middlesbrough side were beaten 3-1 by Luton at Kenilworth Road. Warnock took charge of his 1,602nd game, an English football record, and Josh Coburn\u2019s 15th-minute goal put Boro ahead. But Luton turned the game on its head in the second half with three goals in five minutes from Sonny Bradley, Elijah Adebayo and Harry Cornick.\n\u201cThat\u2019s football, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Warnock said afterwards. \u201cI can\u2019t fault them for effort, it\u2019s just that determination to keep your goal intact really that we haven\u2019t got enough of at the minute, with the lads that we\u2019ve got missing. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the game, three simple goals we\u2019ve given away and yet it\u2019s a game I think we should have won, so it\u2019s disappointing for me on two fronts.\u201d The 72-year-old manager added: \u201c[Kenilworth Road] is a good football ground. Places like QPR, this \u2013 I love the atmosphere like that. I think [Luton fans] respect me, they\u2019ve always given me stick here, and I always give it back if I can \u2013 there\u2019s not enough good humour like that.\u201d Luton\u2019s manager, Nathan Jones, was keen to pay tribute to Warnock after the game. \u201cYou only have respect for him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get to 100 games you\u2019ve been a decent manager \u2026 if you get to 1,602, you have to do something very, very well. Fair play, he\u2019s had a wonderful career. You look back in awe and say that\u2019s the career you want to carve out.\u201d Coventry missed the chance to move into the top three, going down 2-1 at home against Swansea. The away side were two up inside 12 minutes through Jamie Paterson and Joel Piroe and, although Kyle McFadzean pulled one back in the 28th minute, they could not find an equaliser and lost their first home game this season. The Swansea manager, Russell Martin, was full of praise for his two goalscorers after his side\u2019s fourth win in five games. \u201cJoel and Jamie have been incredible for us,\u201d he said. \u201cForget all the goals, the defensive job Joel does for the team is really appreciated. Jamie, you run out of superlatives to describe him.\u201d\nBirmingham were 3-0 winners against Bristol City, with Riley McGree scoring the opener on his birthday. Scott Hogan and Gary Gardner made sure of the points in the second half at St Andrew\u2019s. After the game the Birmingham manager, Lee Bowyer, said that McGree, who is on loan from the MLS side Charlotte FC, will be returning to the US in January. \u201cApparently he is going back,\u201d Bowyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s a blow. There\u2019s lots of blows at the minute \u2013 we are running out of players.\u201d Benik Afobe\u2019s 71st-minute effort gave Millwall a 1-0 victory against Reading to lift them into the top eight while Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United played out a 1-1 draw.

{"title": "Chaotic Manchester United remain in thrall to strolling Cristiano Ronaldo | Jonathan Liew", "article": "The genius of the modern Manchester United is that for all the attention lavished upon them, for all the granular analysis they attract, they remain a largely unknown quantity. When they take the field, you genuinely have no idea what to expect from them. And not just in terms of results, either: tactics, personnel, effort and mood are all equally unforeseeable. They are the hyperactive toddlers of English football, equally capable of moments of startling insight and unfettered joy as they are of throwing valuable household ornaments into the toilet. Naturally, this is a quality greatly prized by Ed Woodward and the Glazer family, whose entire strategy has seemed to revolve around reimagining this working-class football club as a brandable entertainment product.\nEven the fans still seem to be on board for the time being, recognising \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the virtues of a watertight five-year plan and a coherent backroom infrastructure must occasionally take a back seat to the haptic thrill of watching your clump of highly paid frauds pull off yet another sensational comeback. And lo, on a chilly Lombardian night United again went behind, again came back, again changed formations before half-time, again went behind, again came back, again kept the United content machine well and truly in business. For Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who has been in the last chance saloon so many times he knows the bar staff by name and has long since memorised all the questions on the quiz machine, it was another night that felt like it might settle everything and yet seemed to settle nothing. His teamsheet offered us a handy window into the confusion. Four of the back five that had served United so well against Tottenham on Saturday were in operation again. So was Paul Pogba, but in a porous midfield three alongside the wandering Bruno Fernandes and the overloaded Scott McTominay. Up front Marcus Rashford played off Cristiano Ronaldo, an appropriate role for someone so used to feeding children. And so it was a system set up for defensive cover. But also dominating possession. But also playing the ball through midfield. But also the counterattack. An injury to Rapha\u00ebl Varane forced Solskj\u00e6r to switch to a 4-3-3 shortly before the break and, true to form, by the closing minutes United had reverted to their default of simply flinging four forwards on to the pitch and letting them get on with it. It worked. It will work most weeks; individually United are that good. Yet there is a basic irony in the fact that a squad assembled for domination is so poor without the ball that they condemn themselves to long periods of being dominated.\nBoth Atalanta goals were good examples of this. At first glance Josip Ilicic\u2019s goal was crafted by the fumbling limbs of David de Gea, who let the ball squirm through him like a tired fielder at deep square leg. But really the situation was created when Remo Freuler was allowed to advance from midfield and play a simple unpressured pass into the channel for Duv\u00e1n Zapata to cross. Zapata\u2019s goal came from an elementary long ball over the top from Jos\u00e9 Luis Palomino. And against a team as quick and fluid as Atalanta, United\u2019s approach did occasionally smack of: go on, you do something and as soon as we work out what it is, we\u2019ll try and defend it. The problem here wasn\u2019t effort: United\u2019s three midfielders ran more than anyone else on the pitch in the first half. Much has been written and said in recent weeks about United\u2019s reluctance to press from the front, but the real issue here isn\u2019t so much that United don\u2019t press, it\u2019s that some of them do, and some of them don\u2019t, and almost never all of them at the same time. Fernandes is an enthusiastic presser, although \u2013 arrestingly \u2013 often the only one. Rashford wants to press but isn\u2019t really very good at it.\nRonaldo, meanwhile, presses with all the enthusiasm of the guy who fumbles for his wallet when the bill arrives, but has no intention of actually getting it out. And when you have scored as many goals as he has, decided as many games, it\u2019s probably a little late in the day to start quibbling about his defensive output. He\u2019s here now, he\u2019s going to play, and very often he\u2019s going to rescue a game with two goals out of absolutely nothing and keep your Champions League campaign on track single-handedly. This is the Faustian pact you willingly enter when you turn your team into a Ronaldo-pleasure machine. The studio pundit sees a defence in chaos and a midfield overrun and a star striker simply strolling around waiting for someone to give him the ball. But the chaos isn\u2019t the flaw in the system; it is the system. It\u2019s baked in, priced in, hardwired. Ronaldo will solve the problems that Ronaldo creates.

{"title": "Ansu Fati boosts Barcelona\u2019s last-16 hopes with winner against Dynamo Kyiv", "article": "Barcelona\u2019s fate remains in their own hands, which may not have proved the safest place lately but it is better than the alternative. Three days after Ansu Fati turned 19, the kid who already carries so much of the Catalans\u2019 hopes, smashed in the shot which leaves them well-placed to progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League. In all probability, Barcelona will still need to beat Benfica to go through but victory in Kyiv averted the immediate risk of elimination, giving them a little breathing room and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez something to build upon when he arrives.\nThey had lived dangerously, their weaknesses exposed once more, their limitations laid bare, and hearts racing as chances for the home side slipped away in the final minutes, but Barcelona held on to Fati\u2019s 69th-minute strike. Two 1-0 wins, both of them against Dynamo, have given them six points. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see Barcelona qualifying for the next round,\u201d Mircea Lucescu, the Dynamo coach, had said before this game, warning: \u201cBenfica compete better than Barcelona do.\u201d That may well yet be shown to be true and certainly was not disproved here, but for now Barcelona have done enough to occupy second place in Group E. Just. For all that the situation was dramatic, hope lay in what had been seen a fortnight ago at the Camp Nou and was quickly apparent again inside the Olympic Stadium: Barcelona may not be that good, but Dynamo are the team that they should be best equipped to defeat. The only team, indeed, that they had even scored against. Here they did so again, getting the vital goal at the point in which the doubts most took hold. Not that they entirely went away, even then.\nSergi Barjuan, the interim coach, had insisted his side would press high and to begin with they did so, almost taking the lead after just three minutes when Memphis Depay bundled through challenges inside the Dynamo area and fired off a shot from barely five yards that Ilya Zabarnyi blocked. A quick clipped ball into the area from Sergio Busquets nearly brought another opportunity five minutes after and then Fati had a shot closed down. He too was a long way into the area, as was Jordi Alba when he swiped at Gavi\u2019s cross on 15 minutes. That early momentum though faded and soon Dynamo were able to find a way out, reminding Barcelona of their fragility with a sudden dash up the right wing from Viktor Tsygankov. Released into the space behind Alba, he pulled a superb ball back for Mykola Shaparenko right by the penalty spot. The shot was scuffed horribly but it was enough to scare Barcelona and a new game started, Marc Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen having to save sharply from Carlos de Pena not long after.\nThat was a relief: eight times this season, Barcelona had conceded from the first shot on target they had faced and there was more good news almost immediately when Robert Lewandowski scored the opener for Bayern Munich, putting them on course for a victory that would keep Benfica within Barcelona\u2019s reach and ensure that the German champions would be already through as group leaders by the time Barcelona face them. Just as well, as control was slipping from them here. Emboldened, Dynamo pressed more insistently. Tsygankov slipped in Shaparenko whose low effort evaded Ter Stegen\u2019s hand and went just wide of the near post. At the other end, Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet\u2019s diving header against the post was ruled out for offside anyway and Nico\u2019s header hit his teammate Depay almost on the line. Barcelona\u2019s productivity, though, was limited and their vulnerability concerning. Crosses continued to be the weapon to which they turned most often and the best chance of the opening 15 minutes of the second half came when Dynamo opened up Barcelona on the left and the ball came back to Oleksandr Karavaev to bend just past the far post.\nThen, an Oscar Mingueza ball fell to Fati and he turned, swung and sent the ball into the net for a goal that he dedicated to Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Ter Stegen had to save from Serhi Sydorchuk then from Tsygankov, before Zabarnyi\u2019s effort drifted just past the post, leaving Barcelona in second place.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/dynamo-kyiv-barcelona-champions-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:17:40Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Champions League: Bayern and Juve book last-16 places, Lille stun Sevilla", "article": "Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick and missed a penalty as Bayern Munich eased into the Champions League last 16 with a 5-2 home win against Benfica. Benfica saw an early goal disallowed before two goals in six minutes from Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry put the hosts in charge. Morato pulled a goal back for the visitors in the 38th minute and Lewandowski missed a penalty on the stroke of half-time, firing his effort straight at the keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos.\nJulian Nagelsmann\u2019s side did restore their two-goal lead soon after the break through Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s fine finish, before Lewandowski made amends on the hour, clipping the ball over Vlachodimos to finish a sweeping team move. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez cut the deficit with 15 minutes to go, but Lewandowski completed his hat-trick after controlling Manuel Neuer\u2019s clearance and lobbing home from the edge of the box. Bayern are top of Group E with four wins from four games, having scored 17 goals. Benfica slip to third after Ansu Fati\u2019s second-half strike earned Barcelona victory at Dynamo Kyiv. Jorge Jesus\u2019 side travel to Camp Nou on matchday five for a game that is likely to decide who progresses in second place.\nJuventus secured progress from Group H with a 4-1 home win against Zenit. Paulo Dybala put the hosts in front, but a bizarre own goal from Leonardo Bonucci left things level at half-time. Juve won a penalty just before the hour, only for Dybala to fire wide \u2013 but the referee ordered a retake and this time the Argentinian scored. Federico Chiesa and \u00c1lvaro Morata added late goals for Juventus before the Russian side grabbed a late consolation through Sardar Azmoun. Juve go to Stamford Bridge on 23 November to face Chelsea, in a game that is likely to decide who tops the group. In Group G, Lille fought back to upset Sevilla with a 2-1 away win that leaves the Spanish side at risk of an early exit. Lucas Ocampos put the hosts in front on the rebound after 15 minutes, but the French champions levelled through a Jonathan David penalty just before half time, awarded by the VAR.\nLille stayed on the front foot in the second half and were rewarded when Jonathan Ikon\u00e9 scored what proved to be the winner. The forward was first to react after Zeki Celik\u2019s shot came back off the far post. Earlier, Wolfsburg beat the leaders Red Bull Salzburg 2-1 to keep Group G very much up for grabs with two games to play. In Group F, Villarreal shook off speculation linking Unai Emery with the vacant managerial post at Newcastle, beating Young Boys 2-0 at home. \u00c9tienne Capoue and Arnaut Danjuma got the goals as the hosts boosted their hopes of reaching the knockout stages as they moved level with Manchester United at the top of the group.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/champions-league-bayern-and-juve-book-last-16-places-lille-stun-sevilla", "last_update": "2021-11-03T00:10:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},

A very big number for Rishi Sunak to boast about, that\u2019s what. About $130tn (\u00a395tn) to be precise. The chancellor, who is kicking off tomorrow\u2019s finance day at the Cop26 conference, will say that 40% of the world\u2019s financial assets is now owned by institutions aligned with the Paris 2015 goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to no more than 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. That may sound as if $130tn, equivalent to one-and-a-half times annual global output, is going to be unleashed to green the economy, but that is not remotely the case. What Sunak will be saying is that the 450 firms, including investment managers such as BlackRock and banks such as HSBC, have signed up to climate goals under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. It doesn\u2019t mean that the $130tn will be spent on net carbon zero projects and, indeed, does not prevent the continued investment in fossil fuels.\nThe chancellor is optimistic that the commitments by big finance could create a huge pool of cash to fund the net zero transition but \u201ccould\u201d is not the same as \u201cwill\u201d. It is unlikely that more than a fraction of the $130tn will be invested in green projects, in the short term at least. Sunak will also announce that within the next year or so UK financial institutions and quoted companies will have to publish net zero transition plans outlining how they will decarbonise their activities. Setting an example is one way the government can make a difference to the fight against the climate crisis, because while the UK accounts for only 1% of global emissions it has one of the world\u2019s biggest financial sectors. This doesn\u2019t mean investments in carbon-intensive activities will not be allowed, but the government is setting up a taskforce made of figures from industry, academia, regulatory bodies and civil society groups, which will establish a science-based \u201cgold standard\u201d for transition plans to minimise the risk of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d.

{"title": "Cristiano Ronaldo saves Manchester United from dismal defeat at Atalanta", "article": "This was the same tired story of Manchester United\u2019s season. A powder-puff rearguard, an errant midfield, an overreliance on Cristiano Ronaldo to somehow pull the result their way. And he did it: yet again. For the third time in Group F the Portuguese levelled at the last, his fifth strike of the group stage a low volley that avoided the amateurish United being consigned to their second defeat. Before Ronaldo\u2019s intervention, the night\u2019s chief culprits were the dismal Harry Maguire and Paul Pogba, the (supposed) leader of the defence and engine room, who were liabilities and, despite the late escape, the questions will continue regarding Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s position in the buildup to Saturday\u2019s derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford.\nUnited\u2019s shape and plan continues to be executed only intermittently \u2013 on Saturday Tottenham were convincingly beaten 3-0; this time Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side required a 91st-minute strike from their only consistent player to save them. United may head the standings on goal difference from Villarreal but they go to Spain next and it would be no surprise if they come unstuck there, and in the last match at home to Young Boys, and are eliminated, as they were last season. Control is a prime element of what United have lacked so far this season. So when Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford and Ronaldo tapped the ball about and the latter bounced a shot at Juan Musso and, a little later, Scott McTominay\u2019s effort deflected on to a post, it was an apt start. Pogba dispossessed Josip Ilicic near halfway to further suggest Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men were switched on: this proved inaccurate as Ilicic began to display his craft, a neat reverse pass into Mario Pasalic wrong-footing United\u2019s players for a the second time. After failing to heed these warnings, Ilicic struck. Loose defending allowed a Duv\u00e1n Zapata raid along the left to go unchecked and when he crossed the Slovenian beat David de Gea, the finish squirming under the goalkeeper\u2019s body. Yet again those in red had placed themselves needlessly behind the eight ball, and raised the volume of a raucous home faithful. A mis-hit Shaw volley, Ronaldo barging Musso, and the Portuguese fluffing a header were the response but each time Atalanta broke United shuddered.\nOn one occasion a high ball caught Maguire out, Zapata controlled, and United escaped only because his finished went sky-high. Only Eric Bailly\u2019s flying intervention stopped Zapata doubling the lead, the opening arriving due to Pogba dawdling in possession. The Frenchman produced an unwanted replica of the error by leaving a pass too short for Rashford and suddenly Atalanta galloped forward. Solskj\u00e6r, standing in the technical area, must have cursed inwardly, too, when Rapha\u00ebl Varane was forced off injured a few minutes before the break. This caused a rejig: from the three-man defence to a back four, as Mason Greenwood entered to add an attacker. And, somehow, United fashioned an equaliser. Having appeared a bunch of players wondering if they might ever form a unified team, they clicked. It was impressive. Ronaldo found Greenwood who found Bruno Fernandes, whose slick backheel picked out Ronaldo again. He was never going to miss.\nHow Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side would perform in the second half was a conundrum, so erratic are they. If this is a team whose attack has to constantly bail out the defence, the chance that Fernandes failed to convert \u2013 from a Ronaldo delivery \u2013 seemed like it might be costly. As, too, Greenwood\u2019s shot hammered against Musso\u2019s left post on the angle. United\u2019s tackles were clumsy, they could not escape their own territory, and the midfield and defence often went AWOL, as when Zapata was allowed to race clear at De Gea to retake the lead for Atalanta. Maguire flailed \u2013 as he has too often of late \u2013 and the Colombian striker finished well. The goal was flagged offside before VAR correctly overruled the decision. United had just over half an hour to rescue the contest \u2013 and their manager from the next round of criticism and doubt from his many naysayers. Yet unless Ronaldo and company were to work their magic for a countless time the prospects of this occurring felt bleak.\nBut the remarkable 36-year-old did not disappoint. First, on came Nemanja Matic and Edinson Cavani as Solskj\u00e6r hoped to somehow conjure a goal. His prayers were answered, as United\u2019s talisman once again stepped up to be the hero. How much longer Ronaldo can continue the rescue act is fascinating to ponder. For United, though, it is all just not good enough.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/atalanta-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-03T00:38:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Cleo Smith \u2018alive and well\u2019 after going missing more than two weeks ago ", "article": "The mother of Cleo Smith has declared her \u201cfamily is whole again\u201d, after her four-year-old daughter was found alive and well more than two weeks after she went missing from a campsite in remote Western Australia. Western Australia police said they had found Cleo alone in a house in Carnarvon, about 900km north of Perth, at 1am on Wednesday. They arrested a man a short time later. The WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson, told the ABC that police had a 36-year-old man in custody. He said there was \u201cno family connection\u201d. The house she was found in was declared a forensic scene with police officers combing through it, looking for extra evidence that will help piece together how she was taken. \u201cTo find a little girl, a vulnerable little girl, after 18 days, you know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly, hope was never lost,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cThe fact she\u2019s been found alive \u2026 I think Australia is rejoicing, you know, it is such a wonderful outcome.\u201d Dawson said the community in WA, and particularly in Carnarvon, deserved credit for helping with the investigation after police received information about a car connected to her disappearance. Cleo\u2019s mother, Ellie Smith, posted on Instagram at about 6am local time about her daughter\u2019s discovery with the caption \u201cour family is whole again\u201d. The police deputy commissioner, Col Blanch, said police had broken into the locked house and found the girl in one of the rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s my privilege to announce that in the early hours of this morning, the Western Australia police force rescued Cleo Smith,\u201d he said. \u201cCleo is alive and well. One of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her, \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 She said, \u2018My name is Cleo\u2019.\u201d\nCleo was reunited with her parents a short time later. The four-year-old vanished from the Blowholes campsite near Carnarvon on 16 October. Her mother was the last known person to see her. Smith said her daughter had woken up about 1.30am asking for water before going back to bed. In the morning Cleo and her sleeping bag were gone from the family\u2019s tent. \u201cThis is the outcome we all hoped and prayed for,\u201d Blanch said. The Carnarvon shire president, Eddie Smith, told 2GB radio he had realised something was going on when his phone started ringing on Wednesday. \u201cMy phone started to ring flat out and I knew there was something going on here,\u201d he said. \u201cCleo Smith had been found. I rang the police and they told me it was correct.\u201d Australia\u2019s leaders were quick to express their joy at the news and to thank the police and others who had searched for Cleo over two harrowing weeks. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, called Cleo\u2019s discovery \u201cwonderful, relieving news\u201d. \u201cThe fact that that nightmare has come to an end and our worst fears were not realised, is just a huge relief and a moment for great joy,\u201d Morrison said during a press conference in Dubai on Wednesday. Morrison said Cleo\u2019s disappearance had \u201ccaptured the hearts of Australians as we felt such terrible sorrow for the family\u201d. \u201cI want to thank, particularly, all of the police and all of those who were involved in making sure that Cleo is safe and we are so thankful\u2026I just thank God that Cleo is home and that she is safe,\u201d Morrison said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was \u201csuch happy news\u201d. \u201cTo all those who tirelessly searched for this little girl, you deserve our thanks.\u201d Blanch said the outcome was down to \u201csome incredible police work\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cI want to thank Cleo\u2019s parents, the Western Australian community and the many volunteers. And of course, I want to thank my colleagues in the Western Australia police force.\u201d The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, told 2GB his WA counterpart, Dawson, told him he had broken down and cried at the news. Fuller said he had thought the chances of finding Cleo alive were \u201cso slim\u201d. \u201cWest Australian police never gave up on Cleo: it was good old-fashioned police work that resulted in her being found alive,\u201d Fuller said. Blanch said the man in custody was being questioned by detectives. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say on the rescue of Cleo as the day unfolds,\u201d Blanch said. \u201cFor now \u2013 welcome home Cleo.\u201d A press conference was expected to be held mid-morning Perth time. Det Insp Jon Rouse, the manager of victim identification at the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, said he had emailed colleagues in WA early on Wednesday morning to congratulate them. Rouse said he had seen the heartbreak when children could not be recovered, including the tragic case of the Queensland boy Daniel Morcombe, who was abducted from a bus stop in 2003. A taskforce of 100 police officers, led by Det Supt Rod Wilde, had been based out of Carnarvon for 18 days looking for clues into Cleo\u2019s disappearance. They used reconnaissance planes to carry out real-time surveillance. The position of the zipper on the tent flap \u2013 too high for Cleo to reach \u2013 suggested she had not opened the tent herself. \u201cThe positioning of that zipper for the flap is one of the circumstances that has caused us to have grave concerns for Cleo\u2019s safety,\u201d Insp John Munday said five days into the search. That prompted police to pursue the \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d that she had been abducted. Cleo\u2019s mother maintained throughout the ordeal that Cleo would never have left the tent on her own.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/cleo-smith-western-australian-girl-found-alive-after-going-missing-more-than-two-weeks-ago", "last_update": "2021-11-03T04:42:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Joe Biden lambasts China for Xi\u2019s absence from climate summit", "article": "Joe Biden launched a stinging attack on China on Tuesday for the failure of the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to show up to the Cop26 UN climate summit, and failing to show leadership on the climate crisis. The US president said it was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d that his Chinese counterpart had chosen not to attend the summit, where more than 120 world leaders have spent the last two days discussing ways to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Biden told a press conference, speaking before world leaders departed, to leave the floor to their ministers and officials for two weeks of tense negotiations. \u201cThey didn\u2019t show up \u2026 It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away,\u201d he said, also criticising Russia and Vladimir Putin. \u201cHow do you do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?\u201d China delivered a plan for emissions reductions on the eve of the conference that many analysts found disappointing. Under the plan, the world\u2019s biggest emitter would cause emissions to peak by 2030 and reach net zero by 2060, targets it had already set more than a year ago and which if not improved will make it difficult for the world to stay within 1.5C, the threshold beyond which scientists warn some of the impacts of climate breakdown will become irreversible. Earlier in the day, Biden made a point of rejoining the \u201chigh ambition coalition\u201d of developed and developing countries that ensured the 1.5C limit was included in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, reinforcing calls for big emitters to do more to cut carbon this decade. Biden added, however, that he did not seek conflict with China and indicated he could take a softer stance if China stepped up with more measures on the climate. \u201cThis is competition, not conflict,\u201d he said. \u201c[Tackling the climate crisis] is an economic opportunity.\u201d Biden\u2019s words at his final press conference reflect a hardening stance towards China more generally at the talks, from developed countries who want the world\u2019s second biggest economy to go further, especially on phasing out coal, and developing countries who fear the 1.5C goal will slip out of reach without action to halve emissions this decade. China\u2019s head of delegation at Glasgow, the veteran official Xie Zhenhua, was also in a forthright mood earlier in the day, accusing developed countries of having failed the rest of the world, by failing to cut emissions fast enough and by failing to provide the developing world with $100bn a year in climate finance, which has long been promised, to help poor countries cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. China does not receive climate finance but sees itself as a champion of developing country interests. He defended China\u2019s use of coal, saying building a limited number of new plants was necessary to bridge the gap while China updated its energy grid for more renewables, adding that the new plants were highly efficient and replaced old, inefficient plants that were being decommissioned. But he said that he had spoken extensively to John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, and to the UK\u2019s Alok Sharma, who is president of the talks. He said those conversations had been \u201chighly constructive\u201d. Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: \u201cAt Biden\u2019s press conference we saw the whiplash of his rhetoric on climate in action. First he asks Opec to pump more oil, then describes his worry about the horrors of climate change. \u201cTo set his climate ambition straight, it would be profound and game-changing for him to return to Washington and declare a national climate emergency to halt crude oil exports. That\u2019s just one of the tools Biden has to take transformative action on climate without Congress. Biden sounds just as worried as the rest of us, but he has power unlike anyone else\u2019s. For the sake of us and the planet, he has to use it.\u201d Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, delivered an upbeat assessment of the prospects for a deal at the conference that would keep the 1.5C goal within reach, despite having warned at the weekend that the chances were slim.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/cop26-joe-biden-lambasts-china-absence", "last_update": "2021-11-02T22:40:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Whether we\u2019re 5-2 or 5-3 down it\u2019s all about the optics at Cop26", "article": "Make sense of it if you can. Yesterday morning the time was one minute to midnight and humanity was 5-1 down to climate change. Today the time must be at least 50 seconds to midnight and we have clawed back a goal. Or possibly two. Presumably the second one is still being checked by VAR. So the score is either 5-2 or 5-3. Boris Johnson didn\u2019t seem to know which as he prepared to leave Cop26 in Glasgow. Though he did think we were probably heading into extra time. At least that seemed to be the gist of what Johnson had to say, though it was hard to tell as he gives no sign of knowing how football works. In the clash of metaphors, the first casualty is clarity.\nThere again it wasn\u2019t entirely obvious why the prime minister had called a press conference in the first place as he didn\u2019t really have anything much to say. The only logical conclusion was that he had got a bit carried away. He had clearly come to Glasgow expecting the conference to be a total disaster and was relieved to discover that it had all gone a bit better than he expected. Bertie Booster was now cautiously optimistic that world leaders would find enough they could agree on to make it look as if some progress had been made and he wanted to share his excitement with someone. Not that he wanted to raise hopes massively. But 122 nations had agreed to tackle deforestation, 90% of the world was committed to net zero, big strides forward had been made on methane and the developed countries were only going to be a little bit late in making good on an unambitious target of giving \u00a3100bn a year to developing countries. But that all had to be a good thing to have achieved in just two days, didn\u2019t it? At which point Boris relapsed into his James Bond fantasies and started talking about possibly cutting the right wires to defuse the bomb. Understandably the media didn\u2019t entirely share the prime minister\u2019s optimism. Many of the reporters have been to rather more Cop summits than Boris and have a better idea of how these things work. They know the bottom line for many of the world leaders is to come up with a few eye-catching headlines at the beginning of the conference so they can then nip back home \u2013 after congratulating each other on how much they had done to save the planet.\nWhether anything changed was neither here nor there. It was all about the optics. For 48 hours or so the private world of the rich and powerful was played out in public. So we had Boris hailing prime minister Narendra Modi as a hero of climate change because he had committed India to net zero by 2070. Which was at least 20 years too late as the planet would have burned by then. Any idea of taking the game into extra time was for the birds with that sort of target. But Modi had to be praised. Because he would then in turn praise Boris. And everyone deferred to Jeff Bezos. Because the founder of Amazon had promised $2bn to save the Amazon. No matter that he could have easily doubled that level of funding without feeling the pinch. At Cop26, generosity is a relative term. But the organisers couldn\u2019t have been more pleased to have him and his support. So no one dared question Jeff on the hypocrisy of his recent venture into space tourism. Jeff\u2019s carbon footprint cannot be questioned because he\u2019s got so much cash to give. Rather it\u2019s indulged, as he went on to say how life-changing his 10-minute space flight had been. \u201cOh Mr Bezos, you\u2019re so wonderful,\u201d sobbed the compere. See me, feel me, touch me. And it was this \u201cLifestyle par Jeff\u201d that Boris had fallen for and on which he got called out. How come no one was talking about China? Without the active engagement of the world\u2019s biggest polluter everyone was wasting their time. This was like being 5-2 down seconds from the end of the game and playing without two of your star strikers. Johnson didn\u2019t even pretend to have an answer. Things would just work out somehow because they always had in the past. Even if they hadn\u2019t. The trick was to believe. The questions didn\u2019t ease up. How could the world trust Brazil to keep its promises given Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s track record of destroying the rainforest? Boris shrugged. He was sure the Brazilian president would keep his word this time and besides, people would stop buying goods sourced from Brazil if he didn\u2019t. Dream on. Then reality bit. The developing countries were already saying that none of this was enough. They faced annihilation if global temperatures weren\u2019t restricted to a 1.5C rise and even with the new agreements we were nowhere near that. And the developed world needed to stump up far more than the \u00a3100bn a year that it was already not providing.\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to sugar-coat this,\u201d said Bertie Booster. But he did. As that\u2019s what he always does. He can\u2019t cope with too much reality. Just like so many others at Cop26, it\u2019s the illusion of having made a difference that counts. With that, Boris left to go home. He did feel a bit guilty about the private jet, but it was a lot smaller than some other world leaders\u2019 planes, and he could always plant a tree in Downing Street.

{"title": "Alun Wyn Jones to miss rest of Wales\u2019 autumn Tests with shoulder injury", "article": "Alun Wyn Jones has been ruled out for the rest of Wales\u2019 autumn Tests after it was confirmed he requires surgery on the shoulder injury sustained in the defeat against the All Blacks on Saturday. Jones, who was winning his 149th cap for Wales, a world record for a national team, went down clutching his left shoulder midway through the first half, evoking memories of the injury from which he battled back to lead the British & Irish Lions in South Africa. Wales have confirmed that the 36-year-old now faces a number of months out of action.\nThe flanker Ross Moriarty also requires a shoulder operation, after leaving the field in agony on Saturday following tackles by Nepo Laulala and Ethan Blackadder. The Welsh Rugby Union has confirmed that both players face \u201can estimated recovery period of a number of months\u201d and have been released from the squad. Jones was injured in the first half in Cardiff in the same shoulder the Wales captain hurt during the Lions\u2019 match with Japan at Murrayfield four months ago. On that occasion, he made a startling recovery to captain the touring side throughout their three-Test series in South Africa. The injuries represent a huge blow for Wales, who host the world champions, South Africa, this weekend then tackle Fiji before entertaining Australia. Wayne Pivac\u2019s side then begin their Six Nations title defence against Ireland in Dublin on 5 February. Taulupe Faletau has been released from the squad because of an ankle injury suffered in training at Bath, on the same day that the No 8 confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the season. Faletau, who is reportedly set to join Cardiff in the summer, has not played this season and only linked up with the Wales squad on Monday.\nThere was some positive injury news for Pivac on Tuesday, with Liam Williams and Ellis Jenkins both in contention to play South Africa this weekend. \u201cLiam trained yesterday and today \u2026 he is fit and available as far as I am concerned,\u201d said the Wales assistant coach, Neil Jenkins. The Cardiff flanker Shane Lewis-Hughes and the uncapped Ospreys forward Rhys Davies have been called up, while the Cardiff centre Willis Halaholo will rejoin the squad for Saturday\u2019s game having spent 10 days in self-isolation. Nienaber makes changes in bid for Cardiff win The South Africa coach, Jacques Nienaber, has made four changes to the team that defeated the All Blacks in their most recent match, two of them forced by injury and unavailability. Damian Willemse will make his fourth start at full-back in place of a rested Willie Le Roux in a move Nienaber described as \u201ca little side project\u201d. Jesse Kriel takes over on the wing from Sbu Nkosi, who is stranded in South Africa awaiting his visa, while Herschel Jantjies starts at scrum-half in place of the injured Faf de Klerk. \u201cDamian and Herschel have featured off the bench a fair bit and this is an opportunity to give them a chance to start as we look to build our squad depth ahead of the 2023 Rugby World Cup,\u201d Nienaber said. \u201cIf we had to play a World Cup final on the weekend, we would probably select Willie because of his experience.\n\u201cBut this is an ideal situation to allow Damian to settle himself into the full-back position. It\u2019s a little side project. We always want to win but we want to develop and transform and this is an ideal opportunity for us to get some experience into guys on this end-of-year tour.\u201d The Springboks are also without the winger Cheslin Kolbe and the world player of the year, Pieter-Steph du Toit, due to injury for their British tour, which also features matches against Scotland and England. Nienaber is expecting a much-changed Wales team as his side go in search of a first win at the Principality Stadium for eight years. \u201cWales is going to be a nice challenge for us, especially if you look at our record here in Cardiff,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they are physical, they will go toe to toe with us in that department and you will see there are no changes to our starting pack that beat New Zealand in the Rugby Championship. We will have to be at our best physically if we want to get a result this week.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/02/rugby-union-wales-alun-wyn-jones-ross-moriarty-injuries-south-africa", "last_update": "2021-11-03T00:51:41Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Cash-strapped councils must sell off town halls and public toilets, warns minister", "article": "Two struggling councils have been warned they face government intervention unless they selloff publicly-owned assets, including town halls, public toilets, leisure centres and libraries, and push ahead with further cuts to services. The threat by local government minister, Kemi Badenoch, followed publication of reviews into the two councils\u2019 finances which concluded both ran the risk of failing to balance their budget \u2013 effectively going bankrupt \u2013 without urgent action. Badenoch told Peterborough city council, which is run by the Conservatives in alliance with independents, and Wirral council \u2013 run by a minority Labour administration \u2013 they must set out plans within 30 days to balance the books or face possible intervention. \u201cAny faltering in this area would be of considerable concern and could lead to a reconsideration as to whether a different approach might be appropriate to secure the improvements that are necessary,\u201d she wrote. The National Audit Office said this year that at least 25 councils in England were on the edge of bankruptcy after years of cuts, and amid soaring cost pressures. The pandemic has added more issues and both Slough and Croydon councils have declared effective bankruptcy in recent months. Peterborough \u2013 whose leader warned that \u201cdifficult choices\u201d lay ahead \u2013 was told by Badenoch it had still not \u201cfully grasped\u201d the scale of its financial challenges, while in a separate letter she told Wirral it \u201chad not fully acknowledged or perhaps even understood the severity\u201d of its position. Both councils have made tens of millions of pounds of cuts in recent years, despite rising demand for services, particularly in adult social care and children\u2019s services. Both have applied to government for financial support in recent months after concerns they would not be able to balance their budgets. The review of Peterborough\u2019s finances said it had lost nearly \u00a3100m in government funding over the past decade. The council told reviewers services were now at \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d after repeated cuts in recent years and had in some cases reached a basic legal minimum service. However, the reviews insisted both councils had scope to make further cuts to services and should embark on a sale of assets. In Peterborough\u2019s case this should include the sale of 3,000 acres of farmland, which currently bring in rent of \u00a3400,000 a year, the council town hall, and several office blocks. The review of Wirral\u2019s finances concluded that it should sell off a raft of council-owned assets including golf courses, youth clubs, libraries, leisure centres, community centres, public toilets and office buildings to raise cash to balance its budget. The review criticised Wirral council\u2019s apparent reluctance to make cuts or sack staff, saying it had a culture of avoiding \u201cdifficult financial decisions\u201d. It said: \u201cUntil members and officers face up to the need to have to make difficult decisions \u2026 its financial sustainability remains uncertain.\u201d Wayne Fitzgerald, the leader of Peterborough council, said: \u201cThe report acknowledges the very significant challenges we have faced in the past but also recognises that Peterborough\u2019s services perform well and are low cost.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is clear though that I as leader, including all other members, regardless of political party, must take on board the seriousness of these reports and set about implementing some of the recommendations which will mean that very difficult choices are ahead. \u201cGoing forward I want to invest more in services for residents and see the city continue to prosper and grow, but we will need the finances to do so.\u201d Paul Satoor, chief executive of Wirral council, said: \u201cWe will take time to fully digest the findings and recommendations made in these reviews.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/02/cash-strapped-councils-must-sell-off-town-halls-and-public-toilets-warns-minister", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:48:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "When Charles met Scott: prince and the PM come face to face in Cop26\u2019s \u2018last-chance saloon\u2019", "article": "In the run-up to the Glasgow summit, Prince Charles generated headlines when he urged Scott Morrison to attend Cop26. The Prince of Wales argued that the conference could be the last chance to save the planet. At that time, Australia\u2019s prime minister was yet to land his net zero deal with the Nationals, and was equivocating about whether or not he would fly to Glasgow. In a televised interview, the Prince of Wales warned of a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact if leaders didn\u2019t turn up and ambitious commitments weren\u2019t landed. When a BBC interviewer told the prince Morrison had not officially confirmed his attendance, Australia\u2019s future monarch said he was aware he would be accused of meddling but action was needed immediately.\n\u201cYou gently try to suggest there may be other ways of doing things, in my case,\u201d he said. Otherwise, you lot accuse me of interfering and meddling, don\u2019t you?\u201d When asked why it was important a world leader like Morrison attend, he said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say all the time, and the point being that this is a last-chance saloon, literally. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t really take the decisions that are vital now, it\u2019s going to be almost impossible to catch up.\u201d\nGiven that preamble, there was considerable interest in how things might go when the prime minister met the Prince of Wales at the summit. When the prince was ushered into the room on Tuesday, Morrison introduced him to George Brandis \u2013 the Australian high commissioner in London. For context, Morrison noted that he had known Brandis when they served together in the cabinet; the high commissioner was the attorney general in his past parliamentary life. Charles seemed intrigued. While small talk is generally the established protocol for these royal photo opportunities, Morrison was clearly anxious to get down to business. He spoke like a man on the clock. The prime minister is the marketing guy, and there was a pitch to deliver. \u201cBut now we are committed to net zero by 2050,\u201d he told the prince, with no segue apparent between Brandis\u2019s past lawmaking and carbon neutrality. \u201cAustralia has done that here at Cop26, doubled our climate finance commitments, and we are working very closely with our Pacific family.\u201d The words got faster. Morrison noted Prince Charles had always given \u201cgreat attention\u201d to the Pacific. The prime minister\u2019s body language suggested the Australian was hoping for approval. The prince was polite but didn\u2019t gush. At one point, he looked at official photographers, or perhaps an adviser, with an expression best characterised as bemusement. He murmured assent about his well-established Pacific watching, scratched his nose absently, and waved Morrison in the direction of a chair. The show was over. The observers were ushered out.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/when-charles-met-scott-prince-and-the-pm-come-face-to-face-in-cop26s-last-chance-saloon", "last_update": "2021-11-03T02:11:52Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Virginia votes as poll expert says \u2018white backlash\u2019 could power Republican win", "article": "Virginians on Tuesday headed to the polls to elect a new governor, in a closely contested race between the Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin widely seen as a referendum on Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\nThey did so as a leading Virginia polling expert warned that Youngkin may be riding a wave of \u201cwhite backlash\u201d all the way to the governor\u2019s mansion, having successfully focused on controversy over the place of race in education. In the final hours of the campaign, the candidates offered starkly different closing arguments, making their cases to voters whose odd-year gubernatorial elections have long reflected the national political mood a year into any new administration. Saddled by Biden\u2019s sagging poll numbers and intra-party wrangling that has gridlocked the president\u2019s domestic spending agenda, McAuliffe has attempted to tether his opponent to Donald Trump, a polarizing figure in voter-rich northern suburbs. Youngkin has mostly avoided the subject of Trump while embracing many of his tactics, a strategy many Republican strategists believe could be a model for the midterm elections next year. Polls showed an unexpectedly close race in a state that has trended Democratic since the election of Barack Obama in 2008. A loss in Virginia, which Biden won by nearly 10 points in 2020, would be deeply alarming for a party already bracing for a difficult challenge next year. Hours before polls closed in the commonwealth, Biden expressed confidence that Democrats would win the gubernatorial race in Virginia, and hold the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey, where the incumbent, Phil Murphy, is seeking re-election in the Garden state. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d Biden said, leaning into the microphone for emphasis, during a press conference in Glasgow, Scotland. He acknowledged that the contest in Virginia was \u201ctight\u201d, saying the outcome would reflect \u201cwho shows up, who turns out\u201d. But he waved off attempts to read the race as a barometer of his presidency, insisting that McAuliffe\u2019s fortunes in the state were not tied to his poll numbers or his domestic agenda. \u201cEven if we had passed my agenda, I wouldn\u2019t claim we won because Biden\u2019s agenda passed,\u201d he told reporters. The president predicted that Americans would know the result by the time Air Force One touches down in Washington at roughly 1am local time, though some analysts have warned that it could take longer. Changes to Virginia law mean mail-in and early ballots will be tabulated more quickly than in 2020. As such, Democrats may appear to be ahead early in the night, before the localities more favorable to Republicans start counting election day ballots. On Monday, the last day of dueling events, McAuliffe continued to hammer Youngkin over his connections to Trump, warning darkly that a Republican win in Virginia could help pave the way for a Trump comeback in 2024. But then he went further. \u201cGuess how Glenn Youngkin is finishing his campaign?\u201d the former governor, 64, told a crowd in Fairfax. \u201cHe is doing an event with Donald Trump here in Virginia.\u201d That was a lie. Trump was not in Virginia, though he did boost the Republican candidate with a tele-rally. Youngkin did not participate.\nYoungkin, 54, a former private equity executive and political newcomer, closed his campaign with a final attempt to harness parents\u2019 anger over school closures, mask mandates and what their children are learning, and turn it into an election night upset. Asked why education had become a central factor in Youngkin\u2019s stronger-than-expected showing, Larry Sabato of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia said: \u201cOne of the candidates decided it was his ticket to the governor\u2019s mansion and he may well be right.\u201d Speaking to MSNBC, Sabato pointed to the core of Youngkin\u2019s appeal on education: a promise to ban critical race theory in schools. Critical race theory, or CRT, is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Virginia schools, regardless of Youngkin\u2019s promise to ban it. \u201cThe operative word is not critical,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not theory. It\u2019s race. What a shock, huh? Race. That is what matters. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s sticks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of, we can call it white backlash, white resistance, whatever you want to call it. It has to do with race. And so we live in a post-factual era \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter that [CRT] isn\u2019t taught in Virginia schools. It\u2019s this generalised attitude that whites are being put upon and we\u2019ve got to do something about it. We being white voters.\u201d Cultural issues have dominated the race, Youngkin also promising to give parents more control over how public schools handle gender and Covid-19, McAuliffe vowing to protect voting rights and abortion access. McAuliffe, a Clinton ally who was governor of Virginia from 2014 to 2018 \u2013 the state does not allow consecutive terms \u2013 has seen his lead evaporate. Polls have shown Youngkin succeeding by appealing to independents turned off by Trump without alienating his ardent supporters. Youngkin campaigned as an advocate for parents who want more say in their children\u2019s education, capitalising on anger among conservatives who believe schools are overreaching in the name of diversity. Speaking in Richmond on Monday, he promised he would usher in \u201ca Virginia where our government stops telling us what to do all the time\u201d. McAuliffe also handed Youngkin a political gift when he said in a debate in September: \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d He has attacked Youngkin for hesitating to say whether Biden won the presidency legitimately. Youngkin acknowledged Biden\u2019s victory but also called for an audit of Virginia voting machines, prompting Democrats to accuse him of validating Trump\u2019s baseless election conspiracy theories.\nBoth Biden and Barack Obama campaigned for McAuliffe. Trump has not visited the state. In his tele-rally on Monday, the former president told voters Youngkin would protect suburbs and did not repeat his lies about voter fraud. McAuliffe responded on Twitter, saying Trump was \u201cpulling out all the stops to win this race because he knows Glenn will advance his Maga agenda here in Virginia. Tomorrow, Virginia will choose a better way.\u201d In their final word on the campaign, Sabato\u2019s team at UVA moved their prediction from \u201cleans Democratic\u201d to \u201cleans Republican\u201d. \u201cOur sense is that the race has been moving toward Youngkin,\u201d Kyle Kondik and J Miles Coleman wrote, \u201cin large part because of the political environment. McAuliffe\u2019s Trump-centric campaign also just doesn\u2019t seem as potent in a non-federal race with the former president no longer in the White House.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/02/virginia-governor-race-glenn-youngkin-white-backlash-critical-race-theory", "last_update": "2021-11-02T21:03:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Youth services suffer \u2018stealth cut\u2019 of more than \u00a3400m, Labour claims", "article": "Last week\u2019s budget included a stealth cut to funding for youth services worth more than \u00a3400m over the next three years, Labour has claimed. In his budget speech last Wednesday, Rishi Sunak said: \u201cas we level up public services, we\u2019re also levelling up communities \u2013 restoring the pride people feel in the places they call home. \u201cTo do that, we\u2019re providing \u00a3560m for youth services, enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs across the country.\u201d However, the Conservatives had already promised a \u00a3500m Youth Investment Fund in 2019; and the National Citizen Service, which provides young people with volunteering opportunities, has received an average of \u00a3178m over the past three years, according to Labour analysis. If the NCS continued to be funded at that level, and the \u00a3500m Youth Investment Fund was additional money, that would total more than \u00a31bn over the next three years \u2013 almost twice Sunak\u2019s announced figure. Separately, analysis by the House of Commons library carried out for Labour shows that public spending on services for young people in England has been cut by two-thirds in real terms over the past 10 years. Shadow minister for young people, Cat Smith, said: \u201cwith Conservative cuts year on year, it is no surprise we\u2019ve seen a rise of anti-social behaviour alongside the huge challenge of violent crime and county lines. Youth services prevent serious youth violence that costs taxpayers and ruins young people\u2019s lives.\u201d \u201cGiven how much has been stripped away from youth services over the last decade by the Conservatives, this disguised cut from the government is likely to force many grassroots youth organisations to close.\u201d As MPs continued to debate the budget in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MPs accused Sunak of failing to make up for more than a decade of austerity \u2013 comparing his promise of new \u201cfamily hubs,\u201d to the more than 500 Sure Start centres scrapped since 2010, for example. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport conceded that the \u00a3560m promised by Sunak would include the cost of running the pre-existing NCS, which was set up by David Cameron. \u201cWe are determined to give every child the best start in life and level up opportunity across the country,\u201d they said. \u201cLast week we announced plans to invest \u00a3560m to make sure youth services get the support they need. This includes funding the construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived areas of the country, and supporting the running of the NCS over the next three years.\u201d The spokesperson also pointed to almost \u00a35bn set aside for helping school pupils catch up with lost learning in the wake of the pandemic \u2013 though that is significantly less than was recommended by the government\u2019s own adviser on the issue, , who quit in protest. Sunak\u2019s third budget included a slew of spending promises, as the Conservatives seek to live up to their promise to \u201clevel up\u201d neglected parts of the UK; but he also held out the prospect of tax cuts in the run-up to the next election.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/youth-services-suffer-stealth-cut-of-more-than-400m-labour-claims", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:46:27Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Marcus Smith a doubt for England while Randall injury raises questions for Jones", "article": "Eddie Jones has mounting injury headaches before England\u2019s opening autumn international against Tonga on Saturday with Marcus Smith a doubt to face the Pacific Islanders, potentially disrupting the head coach\u2019s plans to unleash a new-look 10-12 axis. Compounding matters for Jones is a report that the scrum-half Harry Randall, who has been ruled out of the entire autumn series, was injured during a paddleboarding session as part of a team-bonding exercise in Jersey last week. In addition, Max Malins, Louis Lynagh and Raffi Quirke will all miss the match at Twickenham with injuries sustained before coming into camp.\nSmith has been severely restricted in training this week due to a lower leg injury and faces a race against time to prove his fitness before Jones names his starting XV to face Tonga on Thursday. Jones remains \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Smith will be fit to play some part in the match but having already revealed his intention to pair the in-form fly-half with his captain, Owen Farrell, in a revamped midfield, the head coach could be forced into a rethink. Jones also has problems at full-back with doubts lingering over Freddie Steward, who also has a lower leg injury, and as a result George Furbank has been retained in Jones\u2019s truncated squad. Scrum-half is a problem position, too. The RFU has insisted that Randall was cleared to train after the paddleboarding session and his hip injury was diagnosed after a subsequent rugby session but his absence, and that of Quirke, leaves Jones light in that department. If Smith is ruled out, meanwhile, Farrell would switch to fly-half with Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade the likely centre pairing, though the uncapped Mark Atkinson has also been retained.\n\u201c[Marcus] hasn\u2019t done much this week, just a bit of ball handling,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re being conservative with him but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that he\u2019ll be right to play. The last call we make is 48 hours before the game. \u201cWe are keen for [Marcus] to be involved in the game. It\u2019s not frustrating, it\u2019s part and parcel of preparing a team, players pick up small knocks, and he\u2019ll recover well. If we don\u2019t get to see him this week we will get to see him next week.\u201d Malins and Quirke were named in the 28-man squad on Tuesday night but neither is in contention to face Tonga, meaning Northampton\u2019s scrum-half Alex Mitchell is set for the matchday 23 with Randall also absent. There was no place, however, for Sam Simmonds, who waits for another England cap having last appeared under Jones in 2018. The Saracens hooker Jamie George has been kept on, having been initially left out of the squad, while Alex Dombrandt, Adam Radwan and Jamie Blamire are all set to add to the caps they won over the summer.\nMeanwhile, Alun Wyn Jones has been ruled out for the rest of the autumn after Wales confirmed he requires surgery on the shoulder injury sustained in the defeat against the All Blacks on Saturday. Jones, who was winning his record 149th cap for Wales, went down clutching his left shoulder midway through the first half, evoking memories of the injury from which he battled back to lead the British & Irish Lions in South Africa.

Former artistic director of the English National Opera John Berry, whose production company Scenario Two is co-producing the show, said: \u201cWe are focusing on finding a new home for this show \u2026 These things happen, it\u2019s not the first change of plan for a West End show, or the last, and current times everywhere are unpredictable.\u201d Scenario Two, Berry added, retains the rights for Into The Woods with Gilliam directing. Last week, the Old Vic posted a brief statement on its website announcing that it and Scenario Two had \u201cmutually agreed\u201d that Into the Woods would no longer take place at the Old Vic. \u201cThe Old Vic wishes the show well for its future life,\u201d the statement said, adding that ticket holders would be contacted directly. Although it was a surprise last-minute cancellation of a show scheduled for spring 2022, a report by the Stage \u2013 independently confirmed by the Guardian \u2013 revealed it followed a protracted row that began when the production was announced last May. At an all-staff meeting at the time, Old Vic executive director Kate Varah allegedly addressed concerns raised by staff who felt Gilliam\u2019s previous comments were at odds with the Old Vic\u2019s culture and values. This included members of the Old Vic 12, the organisation\u2019s artistic development scheme made up of young writers, producers and directors. It is understood that Varah also met with Gilliam and co-director Leah Hausman to discuss these values. The Old Vic has not confirmed this meeting to the Guardian, but in a statement to the Stage it said: \u201cAhead of any season announcement, senior management at the Old Vic would meet with the directors who are programmed to work in the season as a matter of course to discuss our culture and values. This happened with the co-directors of Into the Woods, Terry Gilliam and Leah Hausman.\u201d The organisation\u2019s decision to part ways with Into the Woods came soon after Gilliam posted in support of Dave Chappelle\u2019s new comedy show on Netflix, which has been criticised as transphobic. \u201cI\u2019m encouraging all of you to watch Dave Chappelle\u2019s new show \u2026 To me, he\u2019s the greatest standup comedian alive today: incredibly intelligent, socially aware, dangerously provocative, and gut-wrenchingly funny,\u201d he wrote. The former Monty Python star has previously courted controversy by describing the #MeToo movement as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. In the same interview, he said he was \u201ctired of white men being blamed for everything wrong with the world,\u201d adding: \u201cWhen I announce that I\u2019m a black lesbian in transition, people take offence at that. Why?\u201d In 2017 the Old Vic received 20 allegations of inappropriate behaviour by staff members against the theatre\u2019s former artistic director Kevin Spacey. Into the Woods, which has played on Broadway and the West End, is inspired by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. The Stage reported that Sondheim, the composer, approved the new production because he was impressed with Gilliam\u2019s treatment for the show. While critics said Gilliam had been unfairly \u201ccancelled\u201d, others \u2013 including some members of the Old Vic 12 \u2013 welcomed the move. \u201cThis should have been scrapped over a year ago, but it\u2019s taken them this long to do something right for ONCE,\u201d Nassy Konan wrote on Twitter. Penny Babakhani tweeted: \u201cIt should have been cancelled over a year ago. And the leadership at the Old Vic who owe many of us an apology for the awful, awful way this was handled.\u201d The Old Vic did not respond to an approach for comment. Gilliam has not yet responded.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/02/musical-to-move-after-unrest-at-old-vic-over-terry-gilliam-remarks", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:03:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Ben Raymond, 32, from Swindon in Wiltshire, was one of the founders of NA, whose members hoarded machetes, swords, ice picks, firearms and even a crossbow powerful enough to bring down an elephant, Bristol crown court was told.\nRaymond allegedly acted as a \u201croving ambassador\u201d for the group, which is said to have had links with far-right groups in eastern Europe, Norway and the US and was formed with the aim of beginning a race war. He was also allegedly a close associate of an NA member who planned to kill the Labour MP Rosie Cooper and was in close contact with a man called Zack Davies shortly before he attacked an Asian dentist in a supermarket in north Wales with a machete. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said Raymond was a \u201cpublic face\u201d of NA and was careful not to stockpile weapons himself or carry out physical attacks. \u201cHis jihad was fought with words and images,\u201d said Jameson. \u201cHe was, like Joseph Goebbels of the original cabal of Nazis, the natural head of propaganda. \u201cHe gave media interviews, setting out the group\u2019s virulent ethnic cleansing agenda to the media with sometimes transcendental calm.\u201d Founded in 2013 when Raymond was a student, NA was, Jameson said, \u201cracist, antisemitic and aggressive\u201d, a \u201cwhite jihadist\u201d group the like of which had not been seen in the UK since the British Union of Fascists, which was banned in 1940. The group was small, secretive and paranoid, the jury was told, communicating using cryptic messaging systems, some of which self-destructed, and organised paramilitary training such as mixed martial arts and fighting with knives. NA was banned in December 2016, the court heard, the first far-right group to be proscribed since the second world war, joining organisations such as the IRA and al-Qaida.\nBut Jameson said Raymond and others flouted the ban with NA \u201cmorphing\u201d into cells that continued to operate underground. After the ban another leader emailed fellow members: \u201cWe are shedding one skin for another \u2026 These are exciting times.\u201d Groups that emerged after the ban included the TripleK Mafia, which was based in the Midlands, one in the north-west called Revenge, and Scottish Dawn, the court was told. Raymond used his artistic skills to create the TripleK logos, it is claimed. Raymond denies being a member of a proscribed organisation and possessing material likely to be useful for a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, including information on the making of molotov cocktails.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, who has been a part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) since the start of the pandemic left the group at the end of October, Sky News has reported. The director of the charitable Wellcome Trust had pushed for more mask wearing, use of ventilation and greater Covid testing to try to tackle rising cases, in a plan which has been termed \u201cvaccine plus\u201d. However the government has stuck to its current strategy of trying to encourage people to get vaccinated and for those eligible to take up booster jabs. Farrar revealed in a book published earlier this year, Spike: The Virus v The People, that he almost resigned in September 2020 when cases were rising and the government had just finished its \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme to try to drive people back into hospitality venues. He had also been among those to call for a lockdown in mid-March 2020, as Covid infections increased and other countries like Italy and France saw large numbers of people in hospital with the virus\nIn a statement, he said Sage had come under huge pressure during the pandemic, and that he was leaving to devote more time to the Wellcome Trust. He said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis is a long way from over, with the global situation deeply troubling. \u201cThe high levels of transmission seen in the UK remain concerning, but I stepped down as a participant of Sage knowing ministers had been provided with most of the key science advice needed over the winter months. \u201cThroughout this crisis Sage has provided vital evidence, and independent, expert, transparent advice to support the UK response, often under huge pressure.\u201d He added: \u201cMy focus now must be on our work at Wellcome. This includes supporting the international research effort to end the pandemic, ensuring the world is better prepared for inevitable future infectious disease threats, and making the case so the full potential of science is realised to inform and drive change against all the urgent health threats we face globally.\u201d The government updated public documents detailing Sage\u2019s membership on Tuesday, but Sir Jeremy\u2019s name remained on it. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThroughout the pandemic we have been guided by scientific and medical experts and thanks to our collective national effort we have saved lives, vaccinated tens of millions of people and protected our NHS. \u201cWe knew the coming months would be challenging \u2013 this is exactly why we set out our Covid plan for autumn and winter. We are monitoring all the data closely, and the prime minister has been clear that it does not yet show that Plan B [such as compulsory face masks in some settings, asking people to work from home and introducing vaccine passports] is necessary. But it is ready should we need to act to avoid a rise in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. \u201cOur focus remains on our booster campaign, vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds, and encouraging those who haven\u2019t yet come forward to have their jab.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/jeremy-farrar-sage-scientist-quits-over-concerning-uk-covid-picture-reports", "last_update": "2021-11-02T22:22:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The Italian, who won the Premier League with Chelsea in 2017, replaces Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, felt that he had to act after Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United and he rekindled his interest in Conte, who he had tried to hire in June as the permanent successor to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nConte has been a promised a degree of control over transfer business, alongside Fabio Paratici, the managing director of football, with whom he had a successful spell at Juventus from 2011-14. Levy has assured Conte that he will always back him for the right player. Sales will, however, remain vital to the size of the budget. \u201cI am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,\u201d said Conte, who won Serie A with Internazionale last season. \u201cTottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach.\n\u201cLast summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn\u2019t yet the right time to return to coaching. But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark.

On Sunday Spurs travel to Everton in the Premier League, in which they are ninth after five defeats in their opening 10 games.\nParatici said: \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club.

{"title": "Facebook to shut facial recognition system and delete 1bn \u2018faceprints\u2019", "article": "Facebook will delete the \u201cfaceprints\u201d of more than a billion people after announcing that it is shutting down its facial recognition system due to the \u201cmany concerns\u201d about using the technology. The social media network has been under political, legal and regulatory pressure over its use of the software, which automatically identifies users in photos and videos \u2013 and let\u2019s them know if a fellow user has posted a photo or video with them in it \u2013 if they have opted in to the feature. In a statement, Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, said it would shut down facial recognition on the platform over the coming weeks and delete 1 billion facial recognition templates. Meta\u2019s vice-president of artificial intelligence, Jerome Pesenti, said the technology had helped visually impaired and blind users identify their friends in images and can help prevent fraud and impersonation. But Pesenti said the advantages needed to be weighed against \u201cgrowing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole\u201d. \u201cThere are many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society, and regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use,\u201d he said. \u201cAmid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.\u201d If users have opted into the face recognition setting, the faceprint used to identify them will be deleted. If that face recognition setting is turned off, Meta said there is no faceprint to delete. Pesenti said Facebook will encourage users to tag posts manually. In 2020, Facebook\u2019s parent company paid $650m (\u00a3477m) to settle a US class action lawsuit brought by users who claimed the firm had created and stored scans of their faces without permission. Complaints had also been filed with the US competition regulator and in 2012 a Facebook application to introduce facial recognition in the EU had to be withdrawn because no provision had been made to gain user consent. Pesenti added that the decision reflected a \u201ccompany-wide\u201d move away from facial recognition technology. Meta also owns the Instagram photo-sharing app and the WhatsApp messaging service, with 2.8 billion people using the company\u2019s platforms, including 1.9 billion for Facebook. Last week the parent company rebranded itself from Facebook in recognition of a new focus on the metaverse, a concept where the physical and digital worlds combine to allow people to lead their professional and social lives virtually, via digital representation of themselves \u2013 or avatars. The rebranding and the facial recognition moves come as Meta has been rocked by a series of revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen. The former employee has released tens of thousands of internal documents, and given testimonies to politicians in Westminster and Washington, which exposed Meta\u2019s failure to keep some users safe and contain the spread of misinformation. In the wake of the Haugen revelations Meta has rowed back on one potential product launch by announcing that it has paused work on developing a version of Instagram for 10- to 12-year-olds. It has also stressed that it will develop its metaverse plans in close cooperation with regulators and legal experts. Pesenti said that if the company intended to use facial recognition technology in the future it would \u201ccontinue to be public about intended use\u201d and \u201chow people can have control over these systems and their personal data.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/02/facebook-to-shut-facial-recognition-system-and-delete-1bn-faceprints", "last_update": "2021-11-02T22:39:08Z", "source": "Guardian"},

France is furious over the growing scandal of a leaked text message from the French president to Scott Morrison, and world leaders continue to make pledges to fight the climate crisis at Cop26. French officials have vented their fury at the leaking of a text message from Emmanuel Macron to Morrison, as the prime minister faces accusations he has put his personal political interests ahead of healing the rift. \u201cConfidence has been completely shattered,\u201d a close adviser to Macron said, calling the release of the text \u201ca pretty crude and unconventional tactic\u201d. \u201cIt is not the kind of thing that is likely to improve relations between France and Australia,\u201d the adviser said.

{"title": "Tuchel credits assistant for tactical tweak as slack Chelsea edge past Malm\u00f6", "article": "Even a tactician as smart as Thomas Tuchel needs a bit of help sometimes. He does not have the solution to every structural issue and it helped that he was prepared to listen when his assistant, Arno Michels, laid out the plan that lifted a stuttering display from Chelsea, who were far more incisive after moving Hakim Ziyech to the left and sending Callum Hudson-Odoi to the right with instructions to break Malmo\u2019s stubborn resistance by putting his speedy dribbling to good use. Michel\u2019s ploy soon worked. The right-footed Hudson-Odoi had produced little on the left during the first half, slowing Chelsea\u2019s momentum by cutting inside too much, but he was liberated after moving to the opposite flank. The winger was far too quick for S\u00f8ren Rieks and Franz Brorsson on the left side of Malm\u00f6\u2019s defence and he played a prominent role when the breakthrough arrived early in the second half, flying down the right wing and crossing for Ziyech to settle Chelsea\u2019s nerves on a night when they were regularly pushed out of their comfort zone by limited but spirited opposition.\n\u201cWe got the job done,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cI think maybe now we get judged by results, but who doesn\u2019t? We needed the result, we expected the result, and we delivered. We had a lot of shots in the first half but it was not clinical enough. We wanted to increase the intensity level in the second half to force a goal. In the moment of the highest pressure we were able to use this moment with precision. It was a deserved win.\u201d Ultimately one moment of class was enough for Chelsea, who remain hopeful of finishing top of Group H, although they will need to be sharper when they host Juventus later this month. This was a laboured performance from the European champions, who travelled to Sweden without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Mateo Kovacic, Romelu Lukaku, Mason Mount and Timo Werner, and they were uncharacteristically slack at times. Malm\u00f6, beaten 4-0 at Stamford Bridge last month, put up a good fight. Chelsea, who have won their last seven games in all competitions, did not make life easy for themselves. They seemed surprised when Malm\u00f6 pressed them during the early stages, a boisterous crowd roaring the Swedish champions forward, and Tuchel had reasons to be concerned as half-time approached. There was a carelessness to his team\u2019s passing at times and there was even a chance for Malm\u00f6 to go ahead after 11 minutes, a sloppy error from Ruben Loftus-Cheek forcing Andreas Christensen to mop up as Sebastian Nanasi threatened to break through on the left. Loftus-Cheek, who had not started in the Champions League since 2015, was not the only player in blue who erred during an absorbing opening period. Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi made a complete mess of a short corner routine on the left and Malm\u00f6 grew bolder as the half wore on, Antonio Colak going close to shocking Chelsea when he met Sergio Pe\u00f1a\u2019s pass with a volley inches wide.\nNonetheless there was always a sense that Chelsea\u2019s quality would make the difference. Loftus-Cheek offered some classy touches in midfield after getting that early error out of his system and Malm\u00f6 were clinging on at times, their defending increasingly frantic as the visitors began to dominate. Chelsea, who were pleased to see Christian Pulisic come off the bench to make his first appearance since August after shaking off a persistent ankle injury, should have led at the break. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta threatened from the edge of the area, Ziyech had a shot smothered after bursting through on goal and Kai Havertz was wasteful after being played through by Loftus-Cheek, a heavy touch giving Johan Dahlin the chance to block.\nThe goal eventually arrived. Tuchel had switched his wingers at the break, shifting Ziyech to the left and moving Hudson-Odoi to the right, and the change soon paid off. After 56 minutes Havertz dropped deep and slipped a clever pass through to Hudson-Odoi, who charged down the wing before producing a moment of decisiveness, whipping a bending cross to the far post for Ziyech to clip past Dahlin from close range. \u201cAll credit to my assistant,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cHe had the idea. We liked it. Malm\u00f6 were defending in a low block. We lost some moments if Callum or Hakim had to switch back.\u201d Malm\u00f6, rooted to the bottom of the group after losing their first four games, were unable to respond. Jon Dahl Tomasson\u2019s side tired as the game wore on and the only disappointment for Tuchel was that Chelsea failed to extend their lead, Dahlin denying Havertz. It made no difference in the end. Chelsea were too strong. Their tactical intelligence continues to set them apart.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/malmo-chelsea-champions-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-03T00:28:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "No 10 concerned as 4.5 million eligible people fail to get Covid jab boosters", "article": "No 10 is increasingly worried that hospitalisations and deaths among double-vaccinated people could rise due to waning immunity as an estimated 4.5 million people have failed to get their booster shots despite being eligible. Downing Street sources told the Guardian that the gap between those eligible and those jabbed was too wide, ranking it as their major concern ahead of the winter months. They acknowledged more needed to be done to encourage take-up as waning immunity meant more double jabbed people could get sick and were at greater risk of dying without the extra protection of the boosters. The UK reported 293 deaths with Covid on Tuesday \u2013 the highest level since February \u2013 although the figure included all NHS England deaths from Monday owing to reporting delays. There were 33,865 daily reported cases, a drop from more than 40,000 in recent days, and 9,538 people were in hospital with Covid on Monday compared with 6,467 a month ago. A record 1.6m boosters were delivered last week, with 7m in England since the programme started and hundreds of thousands of people booked in to receive jabs, according to NHS England. However, there are 11.5 million people eligible for their boosters, leaving a gap of 4.5 million. John Roberts, from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, told the BBC on Tuesday expressed worries that not all those in priority groups will have had their third jabs before Christmas. Multiple studies suggest waning immunity from vaccines. Data from Israel, where 78% of people aged 12 and older are fully vaccinated, showed a large rise in infection rates over the summer. The UK-based Zoe Covid Study app, where users can log their jabs, test results and symptoms, has suggested protection against infection after two shots of Pfizer/BioNTech decreased from 88% at one month to 74% at five to six months, while protection against infection after two Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs fell from 77% to 67% at four to five months. Prof Tim Spector, the lead scientist on the study, said in August: \u201cIn my opinion, a reasonable worst-case scenario could see protection below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter.\u201d A Danish study suggested the under-65s had about 80% protection for at least six months, while the over-65s had only 47% protection. The government is pinning its hopes of avoiding further restrictions over the winter on people taking up booster jabs, which are currently offered to over-50s and those with clinical vulnerabilities who had their second jab at least six months ago. Hundreds of walk-in clinics have opened up as part of an NHS campaign. Boris Johnson spoke about the need for people to realise the risks of not having their boosters over the weekend, saying it would be \u201ctragic\u201d if vulnerable people got seriously ill because they were \u201coverconfident about their level of immunity and didn\u2019t get their booster when they needed it\u201d. \u201cI think people don\u2019t quite realise that the first two jabs do start to wane,\u201d he said. Roberts, from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, said that he was concerned that the first priority groups will not all have received their Covid booster jabs by Christmas, warning that this could start to filter through into hospitalisation and death numbers in the next few days. \u201cMy worry is that, at the current rate, we\u2019re still not going to complete the first priority groups one to nine until mid-January,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4. \u201cAnd that\u2019s going to mean that there\u2019s going to be a lot of mixing over Christmas with festive behaviour before and then on the day of people who haven\u2019t got that extra protection from the booster, which really does make a huge difference. The analysis that we\u2019re getting from Israel is that it will probably reduce deaths by 80 or 90% even. So it\u2019s important that we get on with it as quickly as possible.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is vital people come forward as quickly as possible \u2013 there are appointments available across the country and people can book in through the national booking service or use one of the hundreds of walk-in vaccination sites.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/no-10-concerned-as-45-million-eligible-people-fail-to-get-covid-jab-boosters", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:47:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, was among a group of MPs incensed by a report on Monday from ESPNCricinfo that revealed the club\u2019s investigation into the issue \u2013 previously published only as a summary of findings in September \u2013 had concluded the repeated use of the word \u201cPaki\u201d by a senior player, who is still at the club, towards Rafiq was \u201cin the spirit of friendly banter\u201d.\nOn Tuesday Javid tweeted: \u201c\u2018Paki\u2019 is not banter. Heads should roll at Yorkshire CCC. If [the England and Wales Cricket Board] doesn\u2019t take action it\u2019s not fit for purpose.\u201d Sayeeda Warsi, the peer and former Conservative party co-chair who hails from the county, added: \u201c\u2018Paki\u2019 is not banter. Too many of us in too many walks of life have heard the \u2018defence of banter\u2019 for too long as an excuse for racism. For years my business & others supported @YorkshireCCC \u2013 we need you to stop posturing & prevaricating & take responsibility for this.\u201d Rafiq went public last year with allegations of the racism he experienced during two spells at the club between 2008 and 2018, with Yorkshire responding by launching an investigation headed by the law firm Squire Patton Boggs. A summary of the final report was released eight weeks ago, upholding seven of Rafiq\u2019s 43 claims \u2013 including confirmation he was the \u201cvictim of racial harassment and bullying\u201d \u2013 and led to an unreserved apology from the club. Among the findings came an admission from Yorkshire that it had failed to properly escalate Rafiq\u2019s allegations when the former England Under-19s captain first raised them privately in 2018. But last week the club said it was \u201cpleased\u201d to announce that, after an internal review, no disciplinary action would be taken against any current player or staff member.\nAfter much prevarication, Yorkshire finally sent an unredacted copy of its report to the ECB last Thursday, with the governing body having now tasked its own regulatory and integrity teams with looking into the findings. On Tuesday, the ECB said: \u201cWe are conscious about the length of time that Azeem has waited for resolution and the toll that must be taking on his wellbeing and that of his family. We are sorry that, as a sport, this has not yet been resolved. \u201cWe will conduct a full regulatory process that is fair to all parties, but also ensure this happens as quickly as possible. To achieve this, we have secured the services of a QC, along with other external investigatory support to upweight resource around our process. The ECB Board has also reaffirmed its commitment to further additional resource, should the investigation require it.\u201d As well as the ECB\u2019s investigation, it was confirmed on Tuesday that Roger Hutton has been called to face questions from the DCMS committee, while senior management will also be invited to give evidence. Covered by parliamentary privilege, this could lead to more revelations entering the public domain. Julian Knight, MP for Solihull and the DCMS committee chair, said: \u201cWe are extremely concerned by recent reports about the lack of action against individuals following the findings. It\u2019s clear that Yorkshire County Cricket Club has questions to answer.\n\u201cWe have monitored developments around the club\u2019s handling of the serious allegations made by Azeem Rafiq. We want to see much greater transparency from YCCC \u2013 it is time for them to answer their critics. We intend to call the chair of the club before the DCMS committee to give a much fuller explanation than we have had so far.\u201d Knight later tweeted: \u201cGiven the endemic racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club, I struggle to think of any reason why the board should remain in post. This is one of the most repellent and disturbing episodes in modern cricket history.\u201d Along with pressure from MPs and the ECB, Anchor butter, which had its logo on the first team\u2019s shirt during this year\u2019s Royal London Cup, confirmed the partnership would not be renewed. The company tweeted: \u201cThere is never a place or an excuse for racism. We have no further activity supporting YCCC.\u201d Its logo was later removed from the YCCC website.

{"title": "Why are stakes so high in Owen Paterson suspension vote?", "article": "Owen Paterson, the Conservative MP for North Shropshire and a former minister, is preparing to try to avoid a 30-day Commons suspension and possible byelection after the standards committee watchdog last week concluded he committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules. Ahead of a planned vote in parliament on Wednesday, here is a rundown of what he was accused of, the evidence and the potential repercussions: What rules did Paterson break? Paterson was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Department for International Development ministers about the companies, the watchdog found. Three main wrongdoings were identified by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone:\nFirst, breaching the part of the MPs\u2019 code of conduct on paid advocacy. Paterson said he was acting as a whistleblower over milk safety but the commissioner said this was only true of the initial approach and first meeting. Thereafter, follow-up communications \u201cwere intended to benefit his clients rather than to raise a serious wrong\u201d. Second, breaching the same code but the section that relates to using facilities and services funded by taxpayers. The commissioner found Paterson used his parliamentary office and meeting facilities in parliament 25 times for his work for paying clients, and that there were two letters sent on parliamentary paper. Third, Paterson failed to declare his interests in all communications with FSA staff. His \u201cgeneral approach\u201d was to declare his interests, the commissioner said, but she added that under the rules an MP \u201cmust make a declaration in any communication when approaching a minister or official\u201d. The combination of factors led to the commissioner saying Paterson\u2019s breaches \u201cwere so serious and so numerous that they risked damaging public trust\u201d in the House of Commons and in MPs generally. How are sanctions imposed on MPs when this happens? Usually, an investigation is launched by the standards commissioner, who investigates and then passes on their findings to the standards committee, which is made up of MPs \u2013 including four Conservatives \u2013 and other lay members. They scrutinise the evidence and initial findings and then make a final recommendation to parliament. The punishment is proposed as a government motion, and normally uncontested \u2013 MPs consent to the sanction \u201con the nod\u201d without a formal division. However, Paterson has claimed the investigation was biased against him, was not consistent with \u201cnatural justice\u201d and that it played a part in driving his wife, Rose Paterson, to kill herself last summer. Given there is no route of appeal, Paterson hopes to use the Commons \u2013 the final stage where the sanction can be stopped \u2013 as a forum to make his appeal. Why are the stakes so high? The Commons has never before reduced a suspension term, though it has increased them on very rare occasions since the second world war. MPs overruling the body set up to scrutinise their breach of the rules would risk undermining its independence, critics fear. Paterson feels strongly he has been denied a fair hearing because he had witnesses who wanted to give oral evidence but the standards commissioner said their written evidence sufficed. Paterson\u2019s supporters feel he has little more to lose and is fighting to uphold his reputation and his seat in the House of Commons. This would be at risk if MPs vote to suspend him for more than 10 days, as it would trigger a recall petition. If 10% of his North Shropshire constituents were to sign it, there would be a byelection.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/why-stakes-so-high-owen-paterson-suspension-vote", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:06:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "One of Darktrace\u2019s largest shareholders to sell a third of shares after lock-up ", "article": "One of the largest shareholders in Darktrace is to sell a third of its shares in the British cybersecurity firm, in a move brokered at the end of a lock-up that prevents insiders selling their stakes in the recently floated company. Deep Defence, a subsidiary of private equity firm Vitruvian Partners, is to sell 11m shares in Darktrace worth about \u00a370m at the company\u2019s closing price on Tuesday. Shares in the Cambridge-based firm closed down a further 7% to 632.5p as investors concerned about a widespread sell-off of the company\u2019s stock from Wednesday pushed its share price to a two-month low. Vitruvian controls 31.84m shares in Darktrace, about 7% of its 153.25m publicly traded free float. It appointed brokers Berenberg to handle the sale to \u201celigible investors\u201d. The exact price of the share sale was set to be determined through a rapid sale process called an \u201caccelerated bookbuild\u201d. The move will raise further fears among investors of a significant sell-off among other top shareholders in Darktrace, which has seen about \u00a32bn wiped off its market value in a little over a week. The company\u2019s biggest stockholders at the time of Darktrace\u2019s flotation were Summit Partners, the Autonomy founder, Mike Lynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, and KKR and EBT. Senior managers and directors at Darktrace hold about 5% of the company\u2019s shares with Poppy Gustafsson, co-founder and chief executive, holding 2.77m shares, about 0.4%. Last month, KKR, Summit and Balderton Capital sold \u00a3187.5m worth of stock, 25m shares when Darktrace was trading at 759.5p, a combined 3.6% stake. The 180-day lock-up agreement put in place at the time of Darktrace\u2019s flotation in April was waived, allowing the sales to proceed. The lock-up, which applies to those investors who were shareholders at the time of the IPO, expires on Wednesday. In August, the same trio of investors, along with Hoxton Ventures, sold 23m Darktrace shares at 620p valued at \u00a3143.5p. Darktrace, which had been a star performer which joined the FTSE 100 last week, has seen its market value crumble from nearly \u00a37bn to \u00a34.7bn in a matter of weeks. The company is still trading at well over double the 250p at which it debuted on the London Stock Exchange six months ago. Last Monday, two days before Darktrace replaced Morrisons in the FTSE 100 after the grocer\u2019s takeover, an analyst note raising concerns over the business wiped a fifth of the company\u2019s market capitalisation.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/one-of-darktraces-largest-shareholders-to-sell-a-third-of-shares-after-lock-up", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:49:52Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Xi Jinping, Jair Bolsonaro and Joe Biden are among the leaders signing the Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forest and Land Use. Biden has announced a pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Reducing these emissions was touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating before the summit, and almost 100 nations have now set a target to cut methane emissions 30% by 2030. And the US has rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, with the aim of achieving the 1.5C goal at the UN climate talks. The Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda, a plan to coordinate the introduction of clean technologies, including clean electricity and electric vehicles in order to rapidly drive down their cost has been agreed at the Cop26 summit by world leaders, including the UK, US, India and China. African countries will spend $6bn on adapting to climate impacts, says our environment correspondent Fiona Harvey. African countries are preparing to spend at least $6bn a year from their tax revenues on adapting to the effects of the climate crisis and are calling on the rich world to provide $2.5bn a year for the next five years to enable them to meet their goals. \u2018You might as well bomb us\u2019, Surangel Whipps Jr, the president of Palau, told world leaders, speaking of the pain of watching his country suffer \u201ca slow and painful death\u201d. Ecuador is to massively expand protected reserve around Gal\u00e1pagos islands, Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, Ecuador\u2019s president, announced.

{"title": "Cop26: Boris Johnson \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 about reaching 1.5C deal", "article": "Boris Johnson has declared he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about a deal at Cop26 to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C as he urged China to commit to bringing emissions down by 2025. The prime minister had previously said if the climate emergency were a football match the world would be 5-1 down but he said on Monday that the score was now more like 5-2 or 5-3. He claimed there had been a turnaround since the G20 leaders\u2019 summit at the weekend, arguing that a commitment from Brazil on halting deforestation, the Indian pledge on decarbonising power by 2030 and extra cash promised by Japan were good signs.\nHowever, he said there was still a \u201cvery long way to go\u201d before a deal to keep 1.5C alive was achieved. Experts have said that reductions of 28 gigatonnes of emissions by 2030 are necessary to meet that target but pledges so far do not add up to anywhere near that amount.\nJohnson said talks with China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, were now focused on trying to persuade its negotiators to bring forward its pledge for its emissions to peak in 2030 by five years. \u201cYou bet we need more progress from China \u2026 and everyone here at this gathering,\u201d he told a press conference in Glasgow. \u201cThe question is how much before [2030]. That\u2019s the issue. There\u2019s a world of difference between peaking in 2030 \u2026 and peaking in 2025. That\u2019s where we\u2019re keeping the pressure up.\u201d Johnson said another area of pressure was asking developed countries to contribute more in climate finance for developing countries, saying they are going to \u201chave to do more\u201d. UK government sources have acknowledged this is the most difficult area of negotiation and where Cop is likely to fall short. The prime minister said commitments from countries would be \u201c100% useless if the promises are not followed up with action\u201d. Asked about concern among voters about the cost of net zero, Johnson said people had to realise that failing to tackle the climate crisis would be an \u201ceconomic catastrophe\u201d. \u201cI happen to think that there\u2019s a great wisdom in the British people and I think that they can see that this is an issue that needs to be fixed and they may not listen to me, but they certainly listen to Sir David Attenborough and they look at what\u2019s actually happening around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look at the fires, they look at the floods, and they look at the hurricanes, and the increased incidence of all three, much-increased incidence, and they think something\u2019s happening here.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb and they can see that this is something that needs to be tackled,\u201d he added, while ruling out a referendum on the push for net zero. Johnson\u2019s demeanour was more upbeat than at the G20 summit, when he warned of a serious risk of failure in Glasgow. His official spokesperson dismissed the idea that the prime minister had deliberately lowered expectations to later declare his negotiations with other world leaders in Glasgow a success. Asked whether Johnson\u2019s weekend gloom had been expectation management, the spokesperson said: \u201cThe PM felt very much at the G20 that limited progress was made but was by no means the significant boost that was needed. What we\u2019ve seen so far is some early signs that we are starting to make some progress. Again, we are not complacent. This is not a done deal by any means. There is a huge amount of work left to do.\u201d Johnson has still not made a decision on whether to come back at the end of Cop26, and could instead make a statement from Downing Street on what is agreed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/cop26-boris-johnson-cautiously-optimistic-about-reaching-15c-deal", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:04:51Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Guardian view on China and COP26: do not despair | Editorial", "article": "Among the 120 or so world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate crisis talks, there has been one very conspicuous absence: Xi Jinping, president of by far the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for more than a quarter of all emissions. Mr Xi\u2019s decision to stay away is unsurprising; previously a frequent traveller, he has not left his country for 21 months, since the pandemic took hold. But the reduction of the Chinese leader\u2019s contribution to a written statement, making no new commitments, has highlighted concern about Beijing\u2019s recent decisions. The first is its announcement that it will build new coal-fired power plants, a response to extensive power cuts. Though experienced observers hope the medium-term impact will be less serious than it appears, it could imperil China\u2019s pledge to peak carbon emissions in 2030. The second is its national plan on greenhouse gas emissions, revealed last Thursday. While better than the 2015 plan, it offers little progress on its already declared ambitions and falls well short of the action needed to ensure global heating does not exceed 1.5C. And in Glasgow, China has (like India and Russia) declined to sign up to the new 80-country pact to cut methane emissions, although it has joined the agreement to halt deforestation over the next decade. Its failings are, of course, far from unique. China\u2019s carbon emissions per capita are still around half those of the US, and its historical emissions are far lower (though it is catching up fast). Even now, its emissions reflect its role as the world\u2019s factory. Unlike some wealthy countries, it has taken consistent climate action. The US has seesawed, with Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, but even with Joe Biden\u2019s renewed commitment to the issue it has a very long way to go. China made its key pledges in advance of Cop26, promising to peak emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2060, increasing total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 to reach those goals. It has also pledged to end involvement in new coal-fired power stations overseas. Over recent years, it has gained a reputation (merited on renewables) for underpromising and overdelivering. And it has every reason to act. Devastating floods in Zhengzhou this summer will have added to long-term concerns about food security and the safety of prosperous, populous coastal cities. It has based its industrial strategy on the move to renewables, in terms of exports as well as a domestic shift. Its envoy Xie Zhenhua is a veteran of climate talks who has an established relationship with his US counterpart John Kerry and real clout at home \u2013 but not the authority to make new commitments without higher approval. China has also warned the US that cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment of difficult bilateral relations. Its security concerns strengthen its desire to hang on to coal, which it produces domestically. The US and the EU are reportedly looking past China to save their climate strategy, to countries including South Africa and Indonesia. The real issue is less that China came to Glasgow without a new commitment, but that it is better at unilateral declarations than multilateral engagement. Doing it all on its own terms makes the global progress needed far harder to achieve. At Cop26, China could have positioned itself as a world leader. (Instead, India \u2013 the world\u2019s third-largest carbon emitter \u2013 is getting the applause, with Narendra Modi, the prime minister, setting a net zero emissions target of 2070 and significant shorter-term commitments.) Meeting the 1.5C target is crucial. China can and must do more. It should seek to do it hand in hand with other nations.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-cop26-do-not-despair", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:14:22Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Guardian view on Bank of England: talking itself into a rate rise | Editorial", "article": "Did the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, err in exaggerating the prospects of an interest rate rise? It seems so. Mr Bailey\u2019s intervention, along with his chief economist\u2019s, suggested the base rate might rise this week. City traders are now betting that it will do so \u2013 with the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) due to pronounce on Thursday. The governor is now damned if rates rise \u2013 giving the impression that the central bank can be talked into a hike. And he is damned if they do not \u2013 because he signalled rises that did not arrive. There is no pressing reason for money to be made dearer. For many, employment is far more precarious than the official figures suggest. Business surveys report more pessimism than optimism about the UK\u2019s prospects. The chancellor did not help by precipitately withdrawing the fiscal stimulus. The budget ended the furlough scheme, reduced benefits and raised taxes, leaving \u2013 as the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed \u2013 wages stagnant for years to come. This, combined with higher interest rates and a bumpy path out of Covid, risks a recession, not a recovery. The economists David Blanchflower and Alex Bryson point out that, in the last MPC meeting in September, there was a 9-0 vote to keep rates at their current level of 0.1% as the \u201celevated global cost pressures will prove transitory\u201d. Nothing has changed, say the academics, about that prudent judgment. One reason to raise rates would be to bring inflation to heel, but the economists say this is unnecessary. They compare Covid to a hurricane hitting an island. Once the storm recedes, everyone wants plumbers, roofers and electricians \u201cwhose wages rise dramatically for a while and inflation goes up temporarily. But eventually, after a few months, things get back to normal\u201d. A rate hike would promote a needless deflationary shift of disposable income from poorer households that spend to richer ones that do not. In the past decade, the Bank has not used rates to cool asset (ie house) prices. There is little chance that it would now. There are reasons for a rate hike. One is to pay banks more to hold risk-free financial assets. A second is to put upward pressure on the currency, which would benefit City interests. A third is for the Bank to regain control of interest rates by tightening and then offering gilts to private investors rather than purchasing them itself. Raise rates for these reasons and the Bank might look captured by the financial interests that it is meant to oversee. Escaping the pandemic is proving more difficult than the easy getaway that was once imagined. Letting the Bank\u2019s monetary policy \u2013 rather than Treasury spending \u2013 do the heavy lifting in these circumstances is far-fetched. The European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve have blundered since 2010 by tightening too quickly out of a slowdown. Leaving rates unchanged seems the least bad option. Better to wait and see. The four external MPC members are unlikely to back a rate rise. The four undecided bank staff on the committee may do so to please the boss. Mr Bailey risks his credibility if this turns out to be a mistake that has to be reversed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-bank-of-england-talking-itself-into-a-rate-rise", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:09:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Modelling reviewed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in June showed that fully vaccinating 80% of 12- to 17-year-olds would lead to \u201clarge reductions\u201d in infections and a \u201csubstantial reduction\u201d in hospitalisations in the age group. The modelling from the University of Warwick was considered alongside calculations from Public Health England that found vaccinating healthy young people in an overlapping age group \u2013 those aged 15 to 19 \u2013 could reduce intensive care admissions and prevent two deaths per million in the teenagers receiving the shots. Details of the models, described in minutes from JCVI meetings held over the summer, have led some researchers to question why the committee did not approve mass vaccinations for healthy young teenagers, but instead passed the decision to the UK\u2019s chief medical officers. \u201cThey had two models, one from Warwick and one from PHE, both showing significant benefits of vaccination,\u201d said Prof Christina Pagel, the director of the clinical operational research unit at University College London (UCL) and a member of the Independent Sage group. But they appeared to have \u201cdismissed it\u201d, she said.\nThe JCVI concluded that the benefits of vaccination were too marginal to justify in healthy 12- to 15-year-olds who rarely get severely ill with Covid. Explaining the decision, the committee cited uncertainties about a rare and typically mild side-effect called myocarditis, and concerns about the impact that a Covid vaccination programme could have on other school immunisations. The UK Health Security Agency said the modelling was \u201cintegral\u201d to the committee\u2019s decision. But Pagel believes the JCVI was more concerned than it should have been about the risks from the vaccine and underplayed the potential harm caused by the virus. \u201cThe JCVI consistently minimise the chance of bad outcomes of Covid in children as being very rare, but emphasise the rarer chance of developing myocarditis following vaccination,\u201d she said. The UK\u2019s chief medical officers later approved single shots of Covid vaccine for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds after considering the impact on children\u2019s education. The delay in the decision meant that unlike those in some countries, secondary school children in the UK were largely unprotected when they returned to classes in the autumn term. At several points, the JCVI minutes state that natural infection might be better than vaccination for children. The criticisms of the JCVI came as members of Independent Sage and other researchers published work in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine suggesting that fully vaccinating healthy adolescents would reduce hospital admissions, deaths and cases of long Covid at the high case levels now seen in the UK. Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge and a co-opted member of the government\u2019s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) said he shared some of the concerns raised about the JCVI. \u201cBesides apparently ignoring the modelling, I\u2019m worried about the lack of appreciation of the negative impacts of mass infection in children, such as long Covid and the risks of new variants emerging because of the low vaccine coverage in 12- to 15-year-olds. \u201cAnother issue from my point of view is the lack of internationally known and active researchers on the committee who know the virus. With better representation things would have been very different. The government needs to answer why this group was not radically modified for a Covid remit given the range of expertise available.\u201d Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said: \u201cAmong the numerous contributory factors to the currently high caseload and deaths in the UK relative to mainland Europe, a significant one is certainly the impact of having delayed vaccines in secondary schools such that children returned unprotected for the autumn term.\u201d In October, the British Congenital Cardiac Association said that with case rates very high among under-18s in England and Wales, the \u201cbalance of benefits versus risks clearly weighs in favour of the Covid-19 vaccine.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/jcvi-failed-back-youth-covid-jabs-despite-favourable-models", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:59:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Ruggs, 22, will be charged with DUI leading to death after the Chevrolet Corvette he was driving slammed at high speed into the rear of a Toyota Rav4 on a busy thoroughfare in a residential area several miles west of the Las Vegas Strip at about 3.40am on Tuesday. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said: \u201c[R]esponding officers located the Toyota on fire. Fire department personnel responded and located a deceased victim inside the Toyota. The preliminary investigation indicates the front of the Chevrolet collided with the rear of the Toyota.\u201d Ruggs suffered minor injuries in the crash. \u201cThe driver of the Chevrolet, identified as 22-year-old Henry Rugs (sic) III, remained on scene and showed signs of impairment. He was transported to UMC hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Ruggs will be charged with DUI resulting in death. This is an on-going investigation,\u201d the department added in its statement. If convicted, Ruggs would face between two and 20 years in prison.\nThe Raiders said in a statement that they were aware Ruggs had been involved in a crash. \u201cWe are devastated by the loss of life and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are in the process of gathering information and will have no further comment at this time,\u201d read the statement.

We will continue to gather facts and monitor the matter under our policies, but our thoughts at this time are with those impacted by this devastating incident.\u201d Ruggs lost a close friend, Rod Scott, in a car crash in 2016. He often pays tribute to Scott by raising his fingers to the sky during games. The Raiders had a bye week on their schedule and did not play last weekend.

The Raiders selected him in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft and he signed a fully guaranteed four-year contract worth $16.67m. The Raiders have had a difficult year off the field.

They are calling on the Foreign Office to give him the same diplomatic protection as that granted to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The move comes as Nazanin\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, enters the 11th day of a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office. He is pressing the UK government to pay the \u00a3400m debt it owes to Iran from a court case dating back to the 1970s. Iran has made it clear that although the debt is a standalone issue, its payment would help with the release of British-Iranian detainees. In an act of solidarity between the two campaigns, Ashoori\u2019s son, Aryan, was due to join Ratcliffe outside the department. The two campaigns support each other, although there is some discomfort among Ashoori\u2019s supporters that the media and some politicians have persistently given a higher profile to the Ratcliffe case. The Foreign Office had initially told Ashoori\u2019s family that the Middle East minister, James Cleverly, could meet them and his lawyers who are working pro-bono. They insisted that as Ratcliffe met Truss last week they should also be entitled to see the foreign secretary. The meeting between Ratcliffe and Truss was largely unproductive, but it was acknowledged that the foreign secretary had shown her personal concern. In theory diplomatic protection elevates a case to state dispute, making it no longer a consular case. It is arguable how useful diplomatic protection, granted by a previous foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, has proved for Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\nAshooori was given a 10-year jail sentence for allegedly spying, and has had two brief furloughs before returning to jail. He has been on hunger strike in the past, and so far has served four years. Ashoori\u2019s family are likely to ask Truss for her views on remarks by Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the Iranian foreign minister, who claimed he confronted Truss as to why the UK had at the last minute backed out of a deal that would have seen a humanitarian exchange of prisoners including Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He alleged the US, 24 hours before the exchange, \u201csuddenly announced to the British to wait and to make this exchange conditional on the nuclear talks \u2026 at the 90th minute, the Americans connect a completely humanitarian issue to the Vienna talks and the nuclear issue, and prevent this exchange. This is not at all acceptable and issues must be separated.\u201d There is no independent verification of his account, but UK sources have admitted they were very close in June to a prisoner swap.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/anoosheh-ashooris-family-to-meet-liz-truss-as-they-seek-diplomatic-protection", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:49:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Kyle Rittenhouse \u2018the only person who killed anyone\u2019 in Kenosha unrest, prosecutors say", "article": "The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse trial began on Tuesday in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where the 18-year-old is charged with killing two people and wounding one during unrest in the city last August. Prosecutors said that although \u201chundreds\u201d of people were out on the street during protests over the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer, Rittenhouse was \u201cthe only person who killed anyone\u201d. Rittenhouse is charged with two counts of homicide, one of attempted homicide and two of recklessly endangering safety for firing his weapon near others. He is also charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor, as he was 17 at the time. He has pleaded not guilty. In August last year, Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, armed with an AR-15-style rifle and in response to a Kenosha-based militia calling for protection for businesses against protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Rittenhouse is white, as were the two men who died and as is the one who was wounded. Nonetheless, the case has drawn attention from both sides of the political divide over policing and racial injustice. On Monday, 12 jurors and eight alternates were selected in an all-day session. The highly contentious trial, which is expected to last approximately two weeks, will determine whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense or in an intentional act of vigilantism. The judge, Bruce Shroeder, said he would decide at the end of the trial which jurors were alternates and which would deliberate. \u201cThere is no magical way for you to evaluate the testimony,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cInstead, you should use your common sense and your experiences in life.\u201d Rittenhouse looked on, dressed in suit and tie and yawning repeatedly. Shroeder said the state must prove by evidence three elements of Rittenhouse\u2019s homicide charges: that the defendant caused the death of another, that the defendant caused the death by criminally reckless conduct, and that the defendant\u2019s conduct showed utter disregard for human life. \u201cYou cannot look into a person\u2019s mind to determine intent, which must be found, if it is to be found at all,\u201d Schroeder said, adding: \u201cIntent should not be confused with motive.\u201d In his opening statement, Kenosha county assistant district attorney Thomas Binger portrayed Rittenhouse as an antagonist who chose to exacerbate tensions. \u201cLike moths to a flame, tourists from outside our community were drawn to the chaos here in Kenosha,\u201d said Binger. \u201cPeople from outside Kenosha came in and contributed to that chaos. \u201cThe evidence will show that hundreds of people were out on the street experiencing chaos and violence, and the only person who killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse.\u201d Binger added: \u201cWhen we consider the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s actions, I ask you to keep that in mind. We\u2019re not asking you to solve a mystery in this case.\u201d Rittenhouse\u2019s lead lawyer, Mark Richards, argued that Rittenhouse had close ties to Kenosha as his father lived in the city and he had worked as a lifeguard at a local YMCA. \u201cMr Binger makes a big thing out of Kyle Rittenhouse as the only person who shot somebody that evening,\u201d Richards said. \u201cTrue. Mr Rittenhouse was the only person who was chased by Joseph Rosenbaum that evening.\u201d Rosenbaum was one of the men fatally shot by Rittenhouse, who he chased across a parking lot and at whom he threw a plastic bag. \u201cThe government can refer to [Rittenhouse] all they wish as an active shooter,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThe only person he had shot was Joseph Rosenbuam, who had made threats to kill. \u201c\u2026 Kyle Rittenhouse protected himself, protected his firearm so it couldn\u2019t be taken and used against him or other people from Mr Rosenbaum, who made threats to kill.\u201d Richards also said \u201cother individuals who didn\u2019t see that shooting attacked [Rittenhouse] in the street like an animal\u201d.

{"title": "BP can put rocketing gas and oil prices to better use ", "article": "The middle of the Cop26 climate conference was not an ideal moment to demonstrate that producing, refining and trading hydrocarbons remains a spectacularly lucrative business when the stars align. \u201cWe\u2019re a cash machine at these types of prices,\u201d declared the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, cheerfully, referring to oil at $85 a barrel and gas still at multi-year highs. His description is accurate. The oddity of accounting rules around hedging policies meant BP showed a formal loss in the third quarter of this year, but the surer guide to the current financial bonanza was the underlying profit of $3.3bn (\u00a32.2bn). Remember that BP barely broke even in the equivalent period last year. The vaccine-led recovery in the global economy has transformed the outlook. So time for BP to revisit its year-old targets for boosting investment in renewables? Use the current excess of cash to up the pace? Well, no, that is not on the agenda. Looney is sticking to what he promised: a doubling of investment in low-carbon projects this year to $2bn, mainly offshore wind and solar, with an increase to $5bn a year by 2030. The extra cash will instead go to shareholders.\nThe share buyback pledges, it has to be said, are large. The cash machine has been programmed to buy a further $1.25bn of shares before next February. Then the buybacks will continue at rate of at least $1bn a quarter as long as oil prices stay above $60 a barrel. That\u2019s on top of a dividend worth $4bn a year. In round terms, BP\u2019s distributions to shareholders are back where they stood before the pandemic: the dividend has been roughly halved, but buybacks would make up the difference. Naturally, BP would argue \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that its investors would scream blue murder if they were denied their buyback spoils when oil and gas prices are high. The promise of extra distributions in good times was part of the same \u201cfinancial framework\u201d that plots BP\u2019s intended path to net zero by 2050 \u2013 a framework that is meant to withstand any plunge in oil and gas prices. After a single lap of the track, there was no chance of Looney rejigging the arithmetic to accelerate renewables further. But it is the next question if oil is still at $85 this time next year. In the \u201ctransformation\u201d business, which is what BP says it is doing, pace matters. It is not compulsory to throw every spare dollar at share buybacks. THG: caught between a BlackRock and a hard place\nBlackRock has been an investor in THG, or The Hut Group as it was, for about a decade, so well before the ecommerce retailer arrived on the stock market a year ago. The world\u2019s largest fund manager even bought more stock in the IPO, or flotation, emerging as the second-largest holder after founder Matthew Moulding. The decision to flog almost half the stake \u2013 or 58m shares \u2013 therefore looks significant. There was some muttering about portfolio rebalancing, but none of it convincing. There\u2019s only one way to read events when you\u2019re a buyer at IPO at 500p and large seller at 195p a year later: you\u2019ve changed your view of the long-term risks and rewards. Naturally, THG\u2019s share price moved almost directly to the BlackRock\u2019s disposal price, implying a fall on the day of 9%. January\u2019s zany valuation of 800p feels a world away. Moulding, trying to fight the crisis by belatedly preaching a gospel of governance reform, needs to find a credible non-executive chairman sharpish. BlackRock has not made the task easier.\nUnfavourable results fuel poor results at Flutter Bookies always publicise the brief periods when the punters win. It\u2019s good for business. So the \u00a360m hit from \u201cunfavourable sporting results\u201d got star billing within Flutter\u2019s update. Champions League football, international football, American football and Tyson Fury got the blame (or credit). It was enough for a downwards tweak to Flutter\u2019s annual profits forecast, though \u00a31.25bn-ish still sounds OK. All that has happened is a touch of mean reversion. The Paddy Power and Betfair group\u2019s win margin had been a fraction better than normal earlier in the year. The share price, after its rip-roaring run on the back of prospects in the liberalising US market, fell 8%. But at least part of the drop can be explained by the lack of the fresh news on the idea of listing the US FanDuel business, the local number one in a sports betting market that could be enormous. Logic says it will happen because US market valuations for betting businesses are so much higher. The odd footie result is almost irrelevant by comparison.

{"title": "Four more UK energy suppliers go bust amid high gas prices", "article": "Another four energy suppliers have gone bust in a single day as historic gas market highs continue to rip through the UK\u2019s energy market amid fresh fears that Russia may curb gas supplies to Europe. The energy regulator, Ofgem, said the collapse of four small energy suppliers on Tuesday would leave about 24,000 households in need of a new supplier, and bring the total number of bust energy companies to 17 since the start of September, affecting more than 2 million households. The flurry of failures follows rocketing global energy market prices due to a sudden surge in demand for gas as economies began to shrug off restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Gas markets have reached record highs in recent weeks, leading to one of the sharpest increases in home energy bills and fears of a cost-of-living crisis this winter. Out of the four UK casualties Zebra Power had the largest customer base, and supplied 14,800 households with energy. Omni Energy supplied about 6,000 domestic pre-payment customers, while AmpowerUK had about 600 UK customers and supplied a further 2,000 overseas households. MA Energy had about 300 overseas customers. Scores more energy suppliers are expected to collapse in the months ahead as gas markets remain at near-record highs, and suppliers are forced to shoulder the higher costs without raising their tariffs above the regulator\u2019s energy price cap. Consumer charity Citizens Advice said struggling households would ultimately pay the price \u201cwith uncertainty, inconvenience and ultimately higher bills\u201d as suppliers continue \u201cto fall like dominoes\u201d. Gillian Cooper, the head of energy at Citizens Advice, said: \u201cLast week, Ofgem set out how it intends to \u2018raise the bar\u2019 for supplier standards and improve their resilience in the short term. This is a positive step, but it\u2019s clear that existing rules and their enforcement, has not been enough.\u201d Cooper added: \u201cLonger-term, Ofgem will need to do more to make sure companies are financially sound and provide good customer service. This should include protecting people from the loyalty penalty, which prior to the cap allowed companies to profit from those who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t switch.\u201d The energy regulator set out plans for \u201cbold action\u201d last week to fasttrack changes to its price cap, which protects around 15 million households from unfair energy bills, following growing calls from suppliers to make the cap more flexible so that market increases can be passed on to households sooner. The price cap overhaul has emerged amid deepening concerns that gas prices, which are more than three times higher than this time last year, may resume their upward climb as temperatures plunge across Europe and Russia squeezes gas exports to Europe. Gas flows from Russia\u2019s state-owned gas giant Gazprom, which supplies about a third of Europe\u2019s gas, dropped significantly over the weekend and on Tuesday the company declined to offer extra gas supplies to Europe from January, when demand is often at its highest for the winter. The slowdown in gas exports has reignited fears over the winter\u2019s energy suppliers despite a direct order from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for Gazprom to focus on filling its European gas storage facilities from 8 November, when Russian domestic storage should be filled.\nRussia\u2019s decision not to open its gas taps to allow extra supplies into Europe from January also defies calls from the global energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, which said last month that Russia should help to ease market prices by boosting gas exports to Europe this winter. Moscow has denied it is withholding gas supplies from Europe via its pipelines through Ukraine and Poland to exert pressure on German regulators to approve gas shipments through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany. But its decision to send only contracted volumes despite the strong demand for extra gas supplies is likely to raise gas market prices across Europe, helping Russia to charge more for its hydrocarbon exports.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/four-more-uk-energy-suppliers-go-bust-amid-high-gas-prices", "last_update": "2021-11-02T23:51:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},

She added that the problem was growing, with the Great British Beach Clean reportedly seeing an increase from 1.7 wet wipes per average 100m of beach to 18 wet wipes between 2005 and 2020. Anderson told the Commons: \u201cWhen these plastics enter our local marine environment and water systems in such large volumes the damage is absolutely devastating. Globally, 100 million animals die each year from plastic waste alone.\u201d She also cited data from the World Wildlife Fund, which suggested people eat about five grams of plastic a week, which she described as \u201cliterally eating a credit card\u2019s worth of plastic every week\u201d, claiming wet wipes were a \u201chuge cause of this\u201d. The MP told of a recent visit to the Thames where huge piles of wet wipes on the riverbanks had changed how it flowed, and even described seeing a \u201cwet wipe island\u201d in the river. Brands such as Holland & Barrett and the Body Shop had already committed to selling only plastic-free wipes, which are usually made with bamboo or other plant fibres, Anderson said.

In this aspect of his argument, he is wrong. Consciousness is an evolutionary process and, in terms of how far we have progressed, we are still in our infancy. As a result, we are not yet able to see the bigger picture and our place not only in the world but in the cosmos. We cannot think much beyond our next car, meal or overseas holiday \u2013 all of them contributors to systemic environmental collapse. This is especially true of our political leaders, who cannot think much beyond the next election. Until we, as a species, attain a much higher level of consciousness, politicians are unlikely to place the planet ahead of economic interests, as this largely determines whether or not they hold on to power. It would be misplaced, therefore, to expect a major breakthrough on climate change any time soon. Monbiot rather dismisses the small things that we, as individuals, can do because, he argues, in the absence of seismic change, reducing our use of coffee cups or plastic makes little difference. Having not eaten meat for 15 years I\u2019ve resolved this week of Cop26 to stop eating dairy. This small gesture will of course make not one iota of difference to climate change, but at least I can feel a little better about myself as we hurtle towards the apocalypse. Quentin Macfarlane Auchmithie, Angus \u2022 George Monbiot criticises thinking about climate change that focuses on \u201cthe tiny issues such as plastic straws and coffee cups, rather than the huge structural forces driving us towards catastrophe. We are obsessed with plastic bags.\u201d Meanwhile, on the Money pages of the print edition, an article asks how supermarkets rate in their response to the climate crisis. Four of the five subheadings in the article are about plastics or packaging, which, while worthy environmental issues in themselves, have little or no impact on climate change. The fifth is about cycle racks. Perhaps your Money journalists could read the Monbiot article and try again? Stephen Warde Cottenham, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Your article on supermarkets\u2019 progress to achieving \u201cnet zero\u201d was interesting. Unfortunately, the main focus was overwhelmingly to what supermarkets are doing to end single-use plastic. There was no mention of the critical role of supermarkets in ensuring the products of rainforest deforestation do not end up in our shopping baskets. I love my morning coffee, but only a fraction of the coffee products for sale in British supermarkets have any claim to be sustainably sourced. Until we can be confident the products we buy are free from deforestation, stopping use of plastic wrapped cucumbers is little more than a gesture. Debbie Martyr London \u2022 I am loth to criticise the Guardian on its climate coverage, but in an issue that contains George Monbiot\u2019s excellent piece on trivial distraction from the existential threat, giving Abba\u2019s return predominance on the cover rather makes the point.

{"title": "Man killed by \u2018ricocheting police bullet\u2019, inquest hears", "article": "A 52-year-old man was killed by a ricocheting police bullet when he refused to leave his room during an attempted arrest, an inquest has heard. Trevor Smith, a van driver who was suffering from mental health problems, was fatally shot when officers attempted to arrest him at his home in Lee Bank, Birmingham, in the early hours of 15 March 2019. Jurors heard how Smith had been reported to police by his former partner for threatening behaviour towards her. She alleged he once held a gun to her head, and sent her a WhatsApp message showing a gun on his sofa in which he threatened to \u201cdo her in\u201d. She also said that after they broke up in January 2019, he sent \u201cintimate\u201d videos of her to friends and had received a number of greetings cards from Smith containing threats, one of which was a sympathy card with her photo on it saying: \u201cRIP, you\u2019re always in our thoughts \u2013 not.\u201d Following her complaints, police secured a warrant to arrest Smith and search his property for the firearm. A black imitation firearm was discovered at the property. Summarising the circumstances of Smith\u2019s death, the senior coroner Louise Hunt said that during the execution of the warrant, Smith remained in his bedroom where he sat on the end of the bed with a duvet held in front of him and one of his arms was not visible. A police dog was brought on the scene and started barking. Smith dropped the duvet and one of his limbs moved, and one of the police officers fired a weapon, with the bullet ricocheting off the bed frame and hitting Smith. Smith received CPR and an ambulance attended the property, but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. A postmortem confirmed he died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. Smith\u2019s family described him as \u201ca very bright, talented and creative individual\u201d, a well-dressed \u201cfashionista\u201d and an avid football fan who was popular across Birmingham. \u201cTrevor\u2019s life mattered and he did not deserve to lose it in this way,\u201d his sister Lorna Webley said. \u201cOne Friday morning, someone took my brother\u2019s life in three seconds. At this moment, we cannot explain the proper reason for any good cause for his death.\u201d She said Smith, a father of two, had \u201cbattled with mental health challenges for many years, often dismissed by others as bad behaviour\u201d and that he was deeply affected by his father\u2019s death in 2017. In the months before his death his mother noticed Smith seemed depressed and his usual smart dress had become unkempt. The inquest heard that in January 2019, Smith had overdosed in an attempt to take his own life and left three suicide notes, after which he was referred to Birmingham and Solihull mental health NHS foundation trust. Hunt said that over the course of the inquest, jurors would also hear about an \u201cissue\u201d with the defibrillator used during resuscitation attempts and \u201cwhether there was any delay in an ambulance attending because there was a mix-up in the address\u201d.

Her departure leaves the BBC with yet another influential senior news position to fill at a time when such appointments are receiving enormous scrutiny from the government. The BBC is already interviewing for a new head of news, with cabinet ministers privately speculating about which candidates they would prefer for that role. The job of political editor could come up next year if Laura Kuenssberg steps down as expected. Wren spent three years running Newsnight, giving it an all-women lineup of Emily Maitlis, Kirsty Wark and Emma Barnett. The highlight was her team securing the notorious 2019 interview with Prince Andrew about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This hastened the royal\u2019s departure from public life \u2013 but also led to Wren appearing on the front cover of the Radio Times, an honour rarely afforded to the editors of news programmes. She will now replace the outgoing Ben De Pear as boss of Channel 4 News. One of her first tasks will be to oversee the transition to a new lead presenter, who has yet to be recruited, as longstanding host Jon Snow is due to step down after 32 years in the job. Newsnight has remained well-resourced with its own dedicated editor and team of journalists at a time when many other BBC programmes have lost their own staff due to the ongoing centralisation of the broadcaster\u2019s news teams. This has led to some jealousy from other BBC reporters who have been forced to move jobs, who point out Newsnight currently only attracts about 400,000 viewers a night on BBC Two. Channel 4 News also has a question mark over its long-term future due to the looming decision on whether to push ahead with the privatisation of the broadcaster. Ministers have suggested they would retain Channel 4\u2019s news and current affairs output in any privatisation, while ITN has an ongoing deal to keep making the programme that would be expensive to break. However, Channel 4 News\u2019 reputation as a thorn in the side of the government has attracted opprobrium from some ministers, and there are long-term fears about a new private owner finding ways to cut its budget. Wren said Channel 4 News has led \u201csome of the most significant investigations of our time\u201d and she wanted to find ways to speak \u201cto young and underserved audiences\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/02/bbc-newsnight-loses-editor-esme-wren-prince-andrew-interview-to-channel-4", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:59:18Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Levelling-up\u2019 funds awarded to local councils of Tory ministers ", "article": "Two councils in England represented by Tory ministers have received money under the government\u2019s flagship \u201clevelling-up\u201d fund despite being among the least deprived fifth of local authorities nationwide. The health secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s constituency of Bromsgrove got \u00a314.5m in the first announced tranche of cash under the scheme. Central Bedfordshire, which received \u00a326.7m in levelling-up funding for transport improvements and a community wellbeing hub, is partly represented by Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. Lewes council, which is represented by the Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, received the ninth-largest per capita award despite being among the least deprived 40% of local authorities. Lewes received funding for local seafood industries and will also benefit from an East Sussex bid for a new road bridge in Seaford. A number of areas of high deprivation received large awards, including Burnley and Stoke-on-Trent, which got \u00a319.9m and \u00a356m respectively. Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, which includes an area that missed out on funding, said: \u201cThe Tories like to talk a good game on levelling up, but this is yet more proof that it is an empty slogan and that pork barrel politics is the name of the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s high time that the prime minister, chancellor and levelling-up secretary come clean and explain to the people of Billingham, and other areas that have significant levels of deprivation but missed out on much needed funding, why they feel places like Yarm and Eaglescliffe in the Tees Valley, and Bromsgrove and Central Bedfordshire further afield, are more deserving of the levelling-up cash than they are.\u201d The government\u2019s levelling-up fund is designed to combat regional inequality by investing in infrastructure that \u201cbrings pride to a local area\u201d, according to the scheme\u2019s prospectus. Just under half of the 65 English local authorities that will benefit from funding announced in last week\u2019s budget are among the country\u2019s most deprived fifth. However, Bromsgrove, Central Bedfordshire and the Isles of Scilly \u2013 which is to receive funding for a ferry service \u2013 are among the country\u2019s least deprived. Although more Labour councils than Conservative-controlled ones received funding in this first tranche, Tory councils did better per capita at \u00a393 per head of population compared with \u00a365 per head for Labour councils. Councils with no overall control received \u00a3102 per head while the two Liberal Democrat areas announced thus far, Eastbourne and Hinckley and Bosworth, are in line to receive \u00a3183 per capita. Where funding was originally allocated to a county council or city region, the Guardian analysis split the funding across the lower-tier councils that will benefit from a scheme. The announced funding is part of the Conservative party\u2019s broader \u201clevelling-up agenda\u201d. Other announcements have already been made under the towns fund and the future high streets fund while a further pot, the \u00a3220m community renewal fund, is yet to be announced. The first tranche of the \u00a34.8bn levelling-up fund announced last week included cultural regeneration funding for Liverpool\u2019s waterfront and the reopening of the Whorlton Bridge over the River Tees. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \u201cThis analysis is nonsense. The selection process for the levelling-up fund is transparent, robust and fair, and we publish the criteria on gov.uk. \u201cThe first round of funding will help to ensure opportunity is spread more equally across the UK by empowering local leaders, improving public services and restoring pride in place.\u201d This article was amended on 2 November 2021.

{"title": "Banks \u2018being let off hook by weak climate regulation\u2019", "article": "The Bank of England is facing criticism over the way it is conducting its first climate stress tests, with politicians and campaigners warning that a lack of penalties for dirty assets will give banks little incentive to clean up their act. While the regulator has been praised for committing to the exercise, the Bank of England has come under fire for so far refusing to publish data for individual firms, and stopping short of introducing immediate capital requirements, which would make it more expensive to offer loans and services to fossil fuel companies and high carbon projects. Campaigners are concerned that one of the UK\u2019s most lucrative industries is being given a free pass. \u201cFinance is one of the priorities of Cop26, but the UK\u2019s credibility as hosts risks being undermined by the fact it has let its banks pour more than \u00a3200bn into fossil fuels since the Paris agreement was signed,\u201d the Green MP Caroline Lucas told the Guardian. \u201cIt needs to rectify these failures if it is to have any credibility during climate finance negotiations.\u201d The Bank of England is not the only regulator moving cautiously. So far, the European Central Bank and the Banque de France \u2013 which are among the few central banks to have conducted climate stress tests for their respective financial sectors to date \u2013 have only published aggregate data covering their finance industries, and have not introduced any restrictions, or deterrents, for banks serving polluting firms. That is despite warnings from both regulators that banks will be severely affected unless they ramp up their response to the climate crisis. Any deviation from the Paris agreement would result in higher loan losses for banks, according to the ratings agency Moody\u2019s, rising anywhere from 3.5% in the \u201cleast disorderly\u201d scenario, to 20% under the most extreme climate outcomes. It has raised concerns that the banking sector itself will suffer financially without swift action, which could had a ripple effect throughout the global economy. Globally, reporting standards are low. A report by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD) published last year found that while bank reporting has improved since 2017, the sector continues to have the lowest percentage of disclosure for climate-related targets across all global industries, with 19% of firms meeting TFCD standards. By comparison, figures for the energy and transport sectors are 44% and 35% respectively. Part of the challenge is that regulators are intent on gathering as much data as possible before introducing deterrents such as capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial cushion that banks must hold to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets. With such a complex exercise that looks at potential climate scenarios over the next 30 years, campaigners say the Bank of England may be setting an impossible task. Its first climate tests \u2013 which it has not yet committed to repeat after this year \u2013 are far more complex than the regulator\u2019s annual financial stress tests, which were introduced after the 2008 banking crash and measure banks\u2019 resilience against economic shocks like a surge in unemployment, or a sudden collapse in house prices. Instead, the climate tests will put banks through three scenarios with a 30-year time horizon, covering physical and transition risks, including one in which governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C, and a 3.9-metre rise in sea levels. The exercise will also look at how those scenarios could affect potential loan losses, as customers default on their loans due to slowing growth and economic uncertainty. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the perfect data set, you\u2019re going to be disappointed because it\u2019s never going to happen \u2013 there is always uncertainty\u201d said James Vaccaro, who is an executive director of the Climate Safe Lending Network, which represents banks, academics and investors hoping to decarbonise the banking sector. \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to extrapolate the past, but right now in terms of climate change, the past is not a good predictor at all of the likely future,\u201d he said. If that was not challenging enough, the Bank of England is also letting lenders determine how they measure their exposure to those climate risks individually, a move that it believes will foster innovation and unearth best practices that can be shared across the industry. However, that means it will take even longer for UK banks to produce comparable data that will help the public, governments and investors determine where they should apply the most pressure, or pull their business. \u201cAt the moment the financial system is enabling and financing the forces that are driving climate change,\u201d Lord Oates, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 spokesperson for energy and climate change in the Lords, said. \u201cAnd so the regulators have a duty to act now [and] in the absence of perfect information.\u201d\nInternational regulators have proved they are willing to consider capital requirements when new risks emerge. In June, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which consists of regulators from the world\u2019s leading financial centres, highlighted the potential risk around cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying banks should be forced to put aside enough capital to cover 100% of potential losses. Campaigners are calling for similar rules for climate risks. Last week, activists and academics including the historian Adam Tooze, signed an open letter to the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, calling for the introduction of one-for one capital requirements, meaning that for every pound invested in fossil fuel projects, financial institutions such as banks and insurers would need to hold the equivalent to absorb future losses. But not all central bankers are convinced that capital requirements on dirty assets will fully protect against financial shocks, since renewable energy and other innovative green assets could carry investment risks. There are also concerns that introducing capital requirements could cause market turmoil, since forcing a swathe of banks to raise money simultaneously could spook investors and make it more expensive for lenders to secure funds. However, Vaccaro warned that near-term pain might be necessary to create a sustainable future for both the climate and financial system. \u201cWe are potentially and unwittingly, perhaps even unconsciously, sacrificing long-term stability for short-term stability. In other words: don\u2019t rock the apple cart now. But by not rocking it we basically totally hobble it from the perspective of actually getting it fit for the massive shocks that we\u2019re expecting.\u201d The Bank of England said in a statement that \u201cclimate scenario exercises are new and complex across a number of dimensions\u201d. A spokesperson said that it launched the exercise without having a perfect framework in place, since it may have taken years to do so otherwise. \u201cA key intention of the exercise was to build capabilities, and in some regards learn through doing. Consequently, we do not feel individual firm level disclosure at this juncture is appropriate.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/bank-of-england-under-fire-over-climate-stress-tests", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:06:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Eoin Morgan\u2019s belief boosted by reaction to \u2018shocking\u2019 spell against Sri Lanka", "article": "In the immediate aftermath of a gruelling but ultimately thrilling victory over Sri Lanka on Monday, Eoin Morgan was \u2013 as he had for so long earlier that evening \u2013 restraining himself, refusing to let circumstance and emotion carry him away. The match may have ended for England in a joyful clatter of wickets and the increasingly familiar taste of success, but Morgan\u2019s mind was stuck on the period between him arriving at the crease with his team\u2019s innings still young and hitting his first boundary, eight overs that rank among the most awkward of his career. \u201cJos [Buttler] and I talked about it being as hard as we\u2019d faced just to get the ball away, never mind looking for boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cA normal risk-taking shot would have been sweeps, but we didn\u2019t feel sweeps were on with the guys they were bowling and the way the wicket didn\u2019t really bounce at that time. We\u2019re thankful that we just hung in and trusted in our experience. Even really quiet overs, shocking really, but we had nowhere to go, literally nothing to do, and it was better than just slogging it up in the air.\u201d With Sri Lanka\u2019s two spinners, Maheesh Theekshana and especially Wanindu Hasaranga outstanding, and their seamers providing disciplined support \u2013 at least until they lost their length in the latter stages of England\u2019s innings \u2013 Buttler\u2019s first 50 was his slowest in international Twenty20 cricket. He may have ended the innings with a 67-ball century but it took until his 46th delivery \u2013 the ball before Morgan finally scored his first boundary \u2013 to reach halfway.\n\u201cEven Jos, who\u2019s in unbelievable form, really did find it tough. When I got to the wicket he talked about just getting something going, and even he struggled to rotate the strike,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou take in all that information and realise how tough it is, and believe it will get better or you will get a bad ball, and even if you don\u2019t you\u2019re still doing the right thing and trusting the process.\u201d There are several possible criticisms of England\u2019s innings: when Hasaranga dismissed Jonny Bairstow in the sixth over they might have promoted Moeen Ali, who is in excellent form and has a good record against spin, rather than send in their captain; once batting Morgan might have shown intent more quickly given the batting talent to follow, most of which ended up unused; and any strategy that results in a score of 47 for three at halfway and is entirely reliant on Buttler compiling the greatest innings of his career \u2013 Morgan admitted that \u201cwithout that absolutely unbelievable knock we\u2019d have been nowhere\u201d \u2013 is not a very good one. But the 35-year-old insisted that he and Buttler were always playing to a plan. Asked to recall his first boundary, a sweep for four off Hasaranga, he said: \u201cI took a gamble, it worked, it came off, it\u2019s what happens. You have to take risks at different stages. I didn\u2019t take one before then because we didn\u2019t think it was really necessary.\u201d\nThis is a really telling statement. Before scoring 40 against Sri Lanka Morgan had managed only 46 runs in his 10 previous Twenty20 innings for club and country, a sequence that in many might provoke significant soul-searching. He then came in, scored only eight runs off his first 19 balls on a difficult surface, watched his team\u2019s tally creep to 61 for three after 12 overs and still thought his partnership with Buttler would end up being so fruitful risks were not really necessary. It is a level of confidence in yourself and in your teammates that is simply awe-inspiring in scale. \u201cYou sort of always have to believe,\u201d Morgan said of his own form, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t believe nobody else will.\u201d This is why Buttler enthused after the game that, even if it was much less comfortable than their wins over West Indies, Bangladesh and Australia, \u201cwhat this will do for us as a side is fantastic\u201d. It was a night when nearly everything went wrong, and still enough went right. Apart from one dropped catch England\u2019s fielding was outstanding and, despite the dew and the heat \u2013 on a steamy night in Sharjah Chris Jordan sweated so profusely a coach had to be positioned just across the rope with a bespoke Jordan-mopping beach towel \u2013 every bowler impressed except Tymal Mills. He limped off with a quad injury after nine balls which went for 19 runs \u2013 and England\u2019s medical team are awaiting results of a scan with crossed fingers, as Mark Wood is not yet pain-free after his ankle injury. But the greatest impact of the victory will be on England\u2019s mindset: it might have taken a miracle innings to save them from defeat, but now they believe in miracles.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/02/eoin-morgan-shocking-batting-spell-england-sri-lanka-cricket-t20-world-cup", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:29:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Derek Hood obituary", "article": "My friend Derek Hood, who has died aged 56 from cancer, managed to succeed in two very different fields of creativity \u2013 rock drumming and design-based fine bookbinding. Behind the drum kit, playing in bands such as All About Eve and the Auteurs, he was a solid, inventive presence who, being a songwriter himself, always played with an innate sense of musicality. In his book design studio in Bath, he worked on commissions for collectors and institutions around the world. His books were exhibited in the V&A, the British Library and the bibliophile Grolier club in New York. Derek was born in St Andrews, Fife, to Mae (nee McCulloch) and Tom Hood. He went to school at Madras college, leaving at 16, and was encouraged to join the successful family-run DIY store business in St Andrews, along with his elder brothers and younger sister. Punk rock, and the Clash in particular, had fired Derek\u2019s musical imagination, however. By then a drummer in a local band, he instead pursued a rebellious path of resistance, opting to work as an assistant school janitor.\nAt first somewhat reluctantly, he went on to study printing and bookbinding at Napier University in Edinburgh, before working as a fine binder at the library of the University of St Andrews, where his keen artist\u2019s eye and craftsman\u2019s obsession with detail came to the fore. After Derek moved to London in 1994, his drumming skills pulled him back into music, and he played and recorded with such diverse bands as Baader Meinhof, Grand Drive and Babybird. Of his musical talent, Julianne Regan of All About Eve remembers that \u2013 as captured on the group\u2019s 2001 album Live and Electric at the Union Chapel \u2013 \u201cDel was able to balance living in the moment of flow, with maintaining a considerate awareness of the aesthetic of the overall sound, and of the experience of his bandmates.\u201d In his later years as a bookbinder, Derek was regularly invited by the organisers of the Booker prize to create one of the bespoke, one-off editions commissioned for each of the six shortlisted titles, which were then gifted to the authors.

The woman, named by detectives as 52-year-old Dawn Walker, of Halifax, was found dead in the village of Lightcliffe, three miles east of Halifax, West Yorkshire, on Sunday. Her family paid tribute to Walker in a statement released by police. \u201cWe write this with a very heavy heart that yesterday we lost a loving daughter, mother, nanna, sister, auntie and friend. \u201cIn circumstances beyond our control, you were taken from us so suddenly. We ask at this time as a family, that you respect our privacy and allow us to grieve.\u201d A friend of the dead woman told YorkshireLive that Walker had a young son and got married the previous Wednesday. The friend, who asked not to be named, said Walker was kind, caring and friendly. Her body had been discovered in a suitcase on a grassed area at the back of some trees in Lightcliffe, which was cordoned off by police. \u201cShe got married on Wednesday and died on Sunday morning,\u201d the friend said. \u201cDawn was a sound woman. She got married on Wednesday and now this has happened. \u201cShe was the soundest person you could meet. She was friendly and generous. She once paid for a disabled man\u2019s shopping when he was short.\u201d George Robinson, who represents the Hipperholme and Lightcliffe ward on Calderdale council, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for our community. On behalf of everyone in the ward, our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost their loved one. This is all very raw, and it would be improper to speculate on the circumstances.\u201d Robinson said he had contacted the council and police to ask what plans there were to engage and support the local community. \u201cI\u2019ve also asked if the local schools have been briefed and how our young people will be supported,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a closeknit community in Lightcliffe, and it\u2019s an upsetting time for everyone. Please do check in on your neighbours to ensure they are OK.\u201d West Yorkshire police issued a formal appeal for information from anyone who witnessed suspicious behaviour in the area of Aysgarth Avenue, Lightcliffe, or the surrounding streets between 1pm and 4.38pm on Sunday. DI Amanda Wimbles, of the homicide and major inquiry team said: We would like to reiterate the family\u2019s wishes for privacy at this extremely distressing time and ask for people not to speculate on the circumstances regarding Dawn\u2019s death. \u201cWe are continuing to hold a 45-year-old male under arrest in custody at this time as our investigation progresses.\u201d She asked that anyone with information contact police on 101 or using the 101Live Chat facility on the website quoting log 1317 of 31 October.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/west-yorkshire-police-question-man-after-womans-body-found-in-suitcase", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:49:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Residents near the Cop venue said police guarding the security cordon told them to walk long distances through Kelvingrove Park and sidestreets in Finnieston because main streets had suddenly been closed off. One woman tweeted that she had been followed by a man who said he was a police officer despite requesting he leave her alone. Others said they had been told to use longer diversions when their homes were close by. One Twitter user, Katy, wrote: \u201cWe were sent away from one exit to the main gate, then told we had to do exactly that detour to get to Partick.

{"title": "Salisbury train crash may have been caused by leaves on line", "article": "Leaves on the line may have been behind a train crash at Salisbury that left 13 passengers needing hospital treatment and a driver with life-changing injuries, it has emerged. Inspectors from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said early findings pointed to \u201clow adhesion between the wheels and the track\u201d as the reason why the South Western service failed to stop at the junction where two lines merged and crashed into the side of a Great Western train. Such low adhesion is most often caused by leaves on the line. The collision was the first significant crash between two moving trains in passenger service in two decades. Andrew Hall, RAIB\u2019s deputy chief inspector, said on Tuesday: \u201cFrom the initial evidence we have collected, we know that that the passage of the Great Western train travelling from Eastleigh across Salisbury tunnel junction was being protected by a red signal. At this junction, trains coming from Eastleigh merge with those from Basingstoke, so the South Western service coming from Basingstoke was required to stop at that signal. \u201cUnfortunately, it did not stop and struck the side of the Great Western train at an angle such that both trains derailed and ran alongside each other into the tunnel just beyond the junction. \u201cInitial evidence indicates that the South Western train driver applied the brakes as it approached the junction and the red signal, but the train was unable to stop before passing the signal. \u201cThis evidence suggests that the most likely cause of this was wheelslide, almost certainly a result of low adhesion between the wheels and the track. We are continuing to pursue this as a line of investigation amongst others.\u201d Hall said the RAIB had worked with British Transport Police to examine the track and train, and they were continuing to analyse evidence from the trains\u2019 data recorders, signalling systems and CCTV. He said the investigation was \u201cprogressing well\u201d and fuller initial findings would be published later this week. Train services have been disrupted in the area since Sunday, but inspectors said they would be able to hand parts of the crash scene back to Network Rail later on Tuesday. The collision happened at about 6.45pm on Sunday when the a South Western Railway train from London Waterloo to Honiton in Devon ran into the GWR train from Southampton to Cardiff, as they entered the Fisherton tunnel close to the centre of Salisbury, carrying 92 passengers in total. Gareth Dennis, a railway engineer and writer, said the most likely cause of the \u201clow adhesion\u201d was leaves. He said: \u201cThe South Western train was shown red to wait. It looks like as he applied the brakes there was a low adhesion event \u2013 the wheels were sliding. This is a serious problem we have had on our railways for a long time.\u201d Dennis said he believed there were two possible reasons. In some conditions a mist can sit on the rails. But he said it was more likely that leaves were involved. \u201cGiven the season, I would put money on leaf fall,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a mulchy paste forming on the rails, which is an incredibly effective lubricant.\u201d The approach to the tunnel is tree-lined, and Dennis said: \u201cIt is best not to have trees overhanging.\u201d Martin Frobisher, Network Rail\u2019s safety and engineering director, said: \u201cSunday\u2019s accident was incredibly frightening for everyone involved and our thoughts are with everyone injured or affected in any way. \u201cInitial findings suggest that low adhesion played a key part in causing the collision. It\u2019s an issue that affects railways across the world and is something that we, and our train operator colleagues, work hard to combat \u2013 so that we can run trains safely and reliably throughout autumn, and why incidents such as the one in Salisbury at the weekend are incredibly rare. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with investigators to understand what happened and what more we can do to help prevent this happening again.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/salisbury-train-crash-may-have-been-caused-by-leaves-on-line", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:43:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Biden unveils pledge to slash global methane emissions by 30% ", "article": "US president Joe Biden has unveiled a multinational plan to control methane, regarded by the administration as the single most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. Leading an alliance of 90 countries, including for the first time Brazil, on Tuesday Biden set out new regulatory measures to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. The alliance includes two-thirds of the global economy and half of the top 30 major methane emitter countries. China, India and Russia have not joined the pact known as the Global Methane Pledge.\nThe pledge was first announced in September but Biden\u2019s officials have since been working hard to increase the number of signatories and the momentum behind the pledge. The detailed US proposals may prove to be one of the lasting successes of the Cop26 climate conference being held in Glasgow. Many of the regulatory measures do not require Congressional approval, and so give Biden some short-term effective measures to which he can point. The oil and gas industry is reckoned to be responsible for 30% of methane emissions in the US. A new Environment Protection Agency rule that regulates leak detection and repair in the oil industry repealed by Donald Trump will be restored and for the first time applied to new operations in gas, including regulation of natural gas produced as a by-product of oil production that is vented or flared. The Biden team hopes that 75% of all methane emissions will be covered.\nThe other major sources of methane in the US are municipal landfills, thousands of abandoned oil wells and coal mines, and finally agriculture. New rules, due to be phased in, will require companies to oversee and inspect 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, including 300,000 miles (480,000km) of transmission lines and 2.3m miles (3.7m km) of lines inside cities. In Boston alone it is estimated that 49,000 tonnes of methane leak each year. The administration says it is working in concert with the EU and is using a mix of incentives, new disclosure rules and regulation. It stressed that the plan will create thousands of unionised jobs.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/joe-biden-plan-cut-global-methane-emissions-30-percent", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:27:06Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "MPs told to wear masks and tours cancelled amid rising Covid cases", "article": "Covid restrictions are being stepped up in parliament, with MPs told to wear masks, tours of the building cancelled and some staff told to work from home. The move came after the UK Health Security Agency warned the risk of the virus transmitting between those who work in the Palace of Westminster had become \u201cgreater\u201d. Social distancing has also been encouraged again \u201cas far as possible\u201d around the Commons, with committee rooms identified as one of the key areas where the virus is spreading. Non-parliamentary business such as banquets and receptions have also been cancelled for the next two weeks. New guidance issued on Tuesday stated that officials who \u201cdo not need to be on the estate are advised to work remotely\u201d. It added that face-to-face meetings should be avoided as much as possible. Although the contingency measures to guard against further infections in parliament have been activated, the law as it applies to England remains that there is no requirement for people to follow social distancing or wear masks. While people have been advised to wear face coverings in crowded rooms for months, cabinet ministers and most Tory MPs continued to sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the Commons chamber maskless. That changed last week, when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other Conservatives wore a face covering during the budget, though three did not \u2013 including the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg.

{"title": "France backed down in fishing row after Jersey offer \u2018to move things forward\u2019", "article": "France backed down on its threats to clog up British trade and ban UK fishers from its ports after Jersey offered to speed up approval for \u201cfive or six\u201d new fishing vessels in its waters. Ian Gorst, Jersey\u2019s minister for external affairs, said the offer from his administration, which was mirrored by the UK government over an undisclosed number of boats, had proven to be a \u201cgood way to move things forward\u201d. Paris had set a deadline of midnight on Monday by which it demanded further licences for its vessels in UK and Jersey\u2019s coastal waters, only for Emmanuel Macron to announce he would shelve his government\u2019s plans after last-ditch talks called by the European Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s not while we\u2019re negotiating that we\u2019re going to impose sanctions,\u201d the French president had told reporters in Glasgow, where he was attending Cop26. The boats expected to have their approval expedited, having been initially rejected, are replacements for old vessels that had a track record of having fished in the coastal waters of the UK and Jersey. Gorst said that as the talks had gone on in Paris, there also appeared to have been a realisation that triggering the threats would lead to \u201centrenched positions\u201d. \u201cThere are some issues around replacement vessels that we can sort out earlier than we might have envisaged, that is for both us and the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be quite a good way to move things forward and allow more time. Of the vessels that the EU is asking us to reconsider, at least a handful, about five or six, are replacement vessels \u2026 \u201cThe French have taken the view that it is better to try to deal with the individual vessels than trigger countermeasures whereby everybody will become entrenched.\u201d Asked about the issue by reporters at the Cop26 summit, Boris Johnson indicated the UK had not changed its position and played down the issue\u2019s importance. The prime said: \u201cWe are working very, very closely with our French friends and partners on the things that matter most to the people of the world, and that is tackling climate change and reducing CO2. \u201cBy comparison with that hugely important issue, the ones you mentioned are really vanishingly unimportant, but since you ask about whether the UK has changed its position on the fishing issue, the answer is no.\u201d The French government has said that half of the vessels applying to fish in UK and Jersey waters have been rejected unfairly and in breach of the trade and cooperation agreement. The UK and Jersey have said they will issue licences only to boats that meet the test of being able to prove that they have previously operated in their coastal waters. Jersey has so far rejected 55 applicants, of which \u201cfive or six\u201d are replacement boats. Gorst said his government was willing to examine any new evidence \u201cboat by boat\u201d for the rest after a request by the commission. French minister for the seas, Annick Girardin, told the National Assembly that France wanted clarity from the UK by Tuesday evening on how 14 vessels could secure licences in its waters. She also called for swift agreement on the issue of replacement boats and requested that Jersey agree to reconsider its position on a further 13 boats whose applications to fish in the Channel Island\u2019s waters had been rejected. The row until now has been dominated by a dispute over the type of evidence that is acceptable, with France insistent that a set of data known as Sacrois, which provides a rough approximation of a vessel\u2019s movements should be enough. Gorst said there appeared to be a \u201csoftening\u201d from Paris on that point, however. Talks will continue between officials for the next 48 hours. The UK cabinet minister Lord Frost is to meet Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, the French minister for European affairs, in Paris on Thursday. Gorst said the developments had created \u201cbreathing space\u201d but admitted to concerns that relations could again turn sour if France was unable to offer extra evidence to secure permits beyond the \u201chandful\u201d of replacement vessels. \u201cWe have been here before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we would ask about that is, if they have not been able to provide evidence to date it would seem strange to say the least that they could provide evidence for the 55 in the course of the next three days. We believe the evidence has got to be provable.\u201d Macron, who faces an election in six months\u2019 time, is being urged across the political spectrum in France to take a tough line with the UK. \u201cI\u2019m all for giving it an extra 48 hours but we\u2019ll have to be very tough indeed with the British at that point,\u201d centre-right presidential candidate Xavier Bertrand told France 2 television. Earlier on Tuesday, UK environment secretary, George Eustice, had claimed France had retreated from threats of immediate measures because it \u201clooked more closely at the evidence\u201d. \u201cWe just very much welcome the fact that France has stepped back from that course of action. And of course we continue to have dialogue if there are additional vessels that qualify,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Gorst said his government supported the comments from the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who had threatened tit-for-tat sanctions through the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement against France if it imposed sanctions on UK and Jersey boats. A Downing Street spokesman said the talks taking place were on individual licence applications, rather than \u201cthe underlying approach\u201d. \u201cNo new licences were issued to French vessels over recent days,\u201d the spokesman added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/french-fishing-row-climbdown-due-to-evidence-says-george-eustice", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:30:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Boris Johnson has condemned Britain to replay Brexit on a loop | Rafael Behr", "article": "In the war of words over fishing rights in the Channel, much attention has been paid to a single line in a leaked letter from Jean Castex, the French prime minister, to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. The nuances of the offending sentence vary in translation, but the gist is that European public opinion should be left in no doubt that there is more pain associated with leaving the European Union than staying in it. To the Eurosceptic ear, that was confirmation of a spiteful motive on the continent. France, it was alleged, wants to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain for choosing freedom. Viewed from the other side, Castex was merely restating the obvious logic of Brexit: it is a repudiation of European solidarity and a bet on the advantages that a sole trader might gain in rivalry with a syndicate. The syndicate members have an interest in that gamble not paying off. British Eurosceptics are weirdly prickly about that banal strategic fact. It is simply the corollary of their own florid rhetoric down the years, denouncing Brussels as a parasite that saps national vitality and extolling Brexit as proof of EU obsolescence \u2013 the first step in a great unravelling. Self-evidently, the European project is bolstered if Boris Johnson is humbled, and vice versa. In the fisheries dispute, France deserves an ample portion of blame for cynical escalation. President Macron is sabre-rattling with an eye on his domestic audience ahead of elections next year. But his attitude is coloured by seething contempt for a British prime minister whom he sees as a stranger to probity. That feeling was much aggravated by the recent poaching of a lucrative defence contract to build Australian submarines as part of the Aukus security deal with Washington. But it is Johnson\u2019s treatment of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement \u2013 signing a treaty with no intention of implementing its terms \u2013 that convinced the French president that Downing Street had gone full rogue. The crisis in Northern Ireland is vastly more dangerous than a kerfuffle over cod. But they are symptoms of the same syndrome: a Brexit model that makes a sacred principle of sovereignty. All trace of EU institutional leverage must be scoured from the land and dredged from the sea. That fixation guarantees tension at every frontier where old, free-flowing habits are subject to the friction of new checks, forms and licences. The material gains from maximising sovereignty in this way are nil, while costs are mounting. But conceding that the model is flawed is unthinkable in Johnson\u2019s Tory party. Or rather, unsayable. There are MPs who understand what has gone wrong but anticipate only ostracism if they were to speak out. That leads to two policy choices. First, exaggerate or invent fictional benefits from scrapping EU rules. Rishi Sunak dabbled in this with his budget speech last week, disingenuously presenting cuts to alcohol duty as a Brexit dividend. (Booze classifications will indeed diverge from European directives, but the accompanying price drops would still have been permitted.) Second, turn international rancour to domestic political advantage: cite cross-Channel disputes as proof of Brussels\u2019 malevolence, then rebadge the economic pain intrinsic to Brexit as a vindictive backlash from the continent. Already this tactic is being rehearsed in Northern Ireland. What the EU calls implementation of a signed agreement, Eurosceptic hardliners denounce as a blockade. It is a feasible political strategy, albeit a nasty one. But it lacks one crucial element: the heroic destination. Throughout history, revolutionary movements have made excuses for their failures by blaming foreign sabotage. But they have also sustained momentum with visions of a utopian future. That was the Brexit method, too, for as long as EU membership could be made the scapegoat for a whole range of social and economic ills. Now the ills remain but the proposed remedy has already been taken. In that sense (and only that one) Brexit is a victim of its own success. Britain cannot get any further out of the EU. David Frost is scraping the sovereignty barrel. The Tory awkward squad that hounded David Cameron into a referendum, and then harried Theresa May out of office for seeking compromises with economic reality, got all they could have wanted from Johnson. They know their battle is won and are saddling different hobby horses, riding out to new fronts in the culture war, grumbling about the cost of cutting carbon emissions in the tone they once used for \u201cBrussels\u2019 red tape\u201d. Johnson has tried to sustain the rhetoric of Brexit as sunlit upland. His party conference speech last month promised a high-wage, high-skill economy that would spring up in the absence of migrant labour. But that was an essay-crisis utopia, cobbled together from scraps of news about labour shortages and broken supply chains. Besides, by far the most memorable thing Johnson ever promised about Brexit is that he would get it done. That legacy is diluted every time the issue foists itself into the news, as will keep happening. The hunt for purer sovereignty will generate tension with neighbouring countries, which will then be cited as proof that only the purest sovereignty will suffice. This is not the typical revolution where the ends can justify the means. The ends have already been reached. EU membership has expired. We are stuck instead in the purgatory of endless means: a sisyphean nightmare of rolling negotiations that reach a certain point of agreement before breaking down and restarting. Johnson\u2019s Brexit condemns Britain to re-enact forever the tedious, embittered process of leaving with no hope of satisfaction, because we have already left.

{"title": "Ethiopia declares state of emergency as Tigrayan rebels gain ground", "article": "Ethiopia has declared a state of emergency after forces from the northern region of Tigray said they were gaining territory and considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa. The declaration came as Joe Biden accused the government of \u201cgross violations of internationally recognised human rights\u201d and said he that he was removing Ethiopia from a key US trade program, clearing the way for further economic sanctions over its failure to end the nearly year-long conflict. Jeffrey Feltman, the US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, warned that the US would take further measures against the Abiy government within days rather than weeks if it does not end the conflict. He said \u201cWe can proceed down one path that inevitably leads to sanctions and other measures or we can go down another path where we can revitalise the partnership that started when prime minister [Abiy Ahmed] took office. The US wants the latter.\u201d \u201cProlonging the war, dodging genuine negotiations to lead to de-escalation and a ceasefire, and refusing unhindered humanitarian access to avert catastrophe are actions that are taking Ethiopia [in] a dangerous direction,\u201d he said. The announcement of the state of emergency came two days after the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves from the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF). Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods. The state of emergency was imposed after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it was considering marching on Addis Ababa, about 380km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions.\nThe city administration said people should register their weapons and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said. \u201cResidents can gather in their locality and safeguard their surroundings,\u201d it said. \u201cThose who have weapons but can\u2019t take part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over the weapon to the government or their close relatives or friends.\u201d The governments of four of the country\u2019s 10 regions also called upon Ethiopians to mobilise to fight against the Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said. On Monday night, Tigrayan forces said they had linked up with fighters from an Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are Ethiopia\u2019s biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders are currently in prison.\nThe conflict in what was once considered a stable western ally in a volatile region has plunged about 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in the north to flee their homes. Speaking in Washington, Feltman said the US was seeing signs of famine and near-famine and that it was mostly government restrictions that were preventing humanitarian help from getting to people. He said: \u201cIt is not too late to retrace our steps towards the path not taken but the change in direction must occur in days not weeks. It requires the Ethiopian government to take steps we have been raising for months\u2019\u2019. He said he was willing to travel at any time to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to mediate and secure a peace deal with the TPLF. Feltman said there were \u201ccredible and repeated stories of looting, displacement, executions, reports of rape and sexual violence as a tool of war\u201d in which all factions were implicated to some degree. He said that the US will be encouraging \u201cinternational justice and accountability against those responsible for the horrors they have imposed on the Ethiopian people\u201d. He added \u201cthe Ethiopian people who have suffered are going to want to see some kind of justice and reckoning for the horrors they have been through due to this needless conflict.\u201d The conflict started over the night of 3 November 2020, when forces loyal to the TPLF \u2013 including some soldiers \u2013 seized military bases in Tigray, a northern region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there. The TPLF had dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 after years of anti-government protests. When he first came to power, Abiy enacted significant political reforms but rights groups say many of those freedoms have since been rolled back. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2019 for ending a long-running border conflict with Eritrea. Troops from Eritrea, whose president is an arch-enemy of the TPLF, later entered Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-tigray-rebels-gain-ground", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:46:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Jordan Henderson says Luis Su\u00e1rez changed Liverpool\u2019s mentality", "article": "Jordan Henderson has cited Luis Su\u00e1rez as a major influence on his development at Liverpool and believes the controversial striker deserves a warm reception at the end of his Anfield return with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The former Liverpool forward was jeered for his antics during Barcelona\u2019s Champions League semi-final collapse in 2019, his first competitive appearance at Anfield since leaving five years earlier, and sparked a spat with Virgil van Dijk in a 10-minute cameo when the sides met in Madrid a fortnight ago. Henderson, however, insists that fiercely competitive edge benefited him and Liverpool during Su\u00e1rez\u2019s three and a half years with the club and the Uruguay international\u2019s contribution should be recognised on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe all know he\u2019s a top player, has been for a long time, who produced so many good moments at Liverpool,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cI learned a lot from him while he was here. I\u2019m quite close to him and still speak to him. Now and again I\u2019ll call him to see how he is doing, how his family is doing and things like that. \u201cI took a lot from him. He helped us a lot when he was at Liverpool with the mentality side of things \u2013 how he was in training, how he always wanted to win and how he played through pain barriers. He just wanted to get out and play football and try his best for the team. He helped me massively and made me grow in confidence as a player. I had a good relationship with him on the pitch but also off the pitch as well.\u201d\nThe Liverpool captain believes any appreciation for Su\u00e1rez from the crowd should be reserved until after the game, although the 34-year-old may not be overly concerned by his reception. \u201cWhen Luis was here he was phenomenal for a number of years; he was outstanding,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThe fans know that and will appreciate what he did at this football club. I don\u2019t think Luis will be too bothered [at the reception]. Maybe not during the game, but it would be nice after the game for him to get a nice reception from the crowd.\u201d Liverpool were drawn in a Champions League group full of European pedigree but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team can qualify with two matches to spare with another victory. It would be the first time Liverpool have won their opening four games in a Champions League group and intensify the pressure on Diego Simeone\u2019s side, who are level on four points with Porto. Fabinho and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara are in contention after injuries.\nKlopp, who will be taking charge of his 50th Champions League game as Liverpool manager, said: \u201cIt would be big [to qualify early]. We usually have a final in the group but I hope that doesn\u2019t happen this year. Of course we want to avoid that, but we can\u2019t take the second step before the first step. We just have to win, and then afterwards we can talk about what kind of achievement that would be. \u201cFor the moment we have to prepare a football game against one of the best sides in the world, one of the best organised and one of the best motivated. They go for everything all the time. We play them now for the fifth time, including a [pre-season] tournament in Munich, so we know a lot about each other. There should not be a lot of surprises.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/jordan-henderson-liverpool-fans-luis-suarez-atletico-madrid", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:06:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "T20 World Cup win over Australia can be confidence boost for Ashes, says Root", "article": "Joe Root fancies the shellacking England\u2019s Twenty20 side handed out to Australia last Saturday has increased confidence before the Ashes campaign, even if the personnel, format and conditions will differ from the World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. England\u2019s tour of Australia officially gets under way on Thursday when a squad of 13 red-ball specialists \u2013 including the recently added Ben Stokes \u2013 and 15 Lions players fly to Queensland to begin preparations for the five-match series that starts at the Gabba on 8 December. Of the five players set to join them after the World Cup \u2013 the final of which is on 14 November \u2013 four played in the eight-wicket group stage win against Australia, although only Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan appear certain starters in the Test side. Jonny Bairstow and Chris Woakes will push for spots, while Mark Wood, yet to feature in the UAE because of an ankle injury, will have to prove his fitness.\nNevertheless, along with the significance of India winning in Australia this year, Root sees some relevance from a short-form victory over a team that included five Test regulars in David Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. \u201cIndia proved to the rest of the world that Australia is not a place you can\u2019t go and win,\u201d Root said. \u201cThey took them on in their own way, they played to their strengths, but they didn\u2019t take a backward step at any stage. It\u2019s making sure we do the work now and we give ourselves that confidence. \u201cAnd also probably try and lean on that confidence and performance the T20 side put in the other night. There will be guys from both teams involved in that series and you want to try and capture as much confidence as you can.\u201d The start of the Ashes tour will be like no other before it. England\u2019s players and a backroom staff initially led by Graham Thorpe are expected to touch down in Brisbane and then travel to a resort on the Gold Coast for a two-week quarantine period where they will spend the first three days isolating in hotel rooms.\nThe enlarged squad will then be allowed time outside and begin training at the multipurpose Metricon Stadium in Carrara; once the fortnight is complete, further freedoms in line with local restrictions will follow, even if the focus will be on the two intra-squad matches that serve as their only warm-up cricket.\nA bubble of sorts will still be in place and mindful of the need to establish protocols on the ground and avoid any breaches, the England and Wales Cricket Board is understood to be flying out Steve Elworthy for the first month of the tour in what represents a final outing for the director of events before he takes up his new role as Surrey\u2019s chief executive. Elworthy masterminded the ECB\u2019s behind-closed-doors summer of 2020 and the bubbles that prevented any Covid-19 cases; as Root stressed on Tuesday after a training session at Loughborough, it is imperative the players remain respectful of the rules, even if bubble life is grating after 18 months. On England\u2019s own experience of facing India during the summer, a series they finished 2-1 down but will not be decided until the rescheduled fifth Test next year, Root said: \u201cThere were a couple of occasions when games could have gone either way and India just grabbed it ahead of us. \u201cWe have to have the bit between our teeth and stand up at those key moments and say: \u2018Right, we are going grab this game,\u2019 and make sure that we are the ones in that tight moment who get across the line and get the win. It\u2019s a great lesson for us all. \u201cI\u2019m very wary about commenting too much on Australia, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach for us. It\u2019s never really been something that we\u2019ve paid too much attention to.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our research and make sure we\u2019re very well prepared for what Australia are likely to throw at us, but ultimately we need to make sure our own house is in order, that we\u2019re as ready as we can be.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/02/joe-root-england-t20-inspiration-for-ashes", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:17:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Museum displaying entire Boijmans collection to open in world first", "article": "It is being described as the \u201cmuseum of the future\u201d, with institutions across the world including London\u2019s V&A set to follow the path pioneered by Rotterdam\u2019s Boijmans Van Beuningen. From Saturday, in what is a world first, the King of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander, will open the Depot, a bowl-shaped warehouse next to the Boijmans museum\u2019s original 1930s building in which all 151,000 items in its revered collection, from the Van Goghs to its Magrittes and Dal\u00eds, will be on permanent display to the public. As is the case with major museums across the world, the Boijmans, first opened in 1849 to show of the collections of Frans Jacob Otto Boijmans and Dani\u00ebl George van Beuningen, has for a long time only been able to display about 4% of its treasures in permanent and temporary exhibitions. But from this weekend, for \u20ac20, visitors \u2013 wearing protective coats and asked to restrict themselves to carrying a small bag for the purposes of security \u2013 will have the full gamut of the museum\u2019s crown jewels to view across six floors.\nThose entering the 40-metre-high building, whose exterior is made up of soaring curved mirrors, will be able to watch the museum\u2019s art restorers as they work, learn about the internal workings of the institution, and travel through five different microclimates made suitable for metal, plastic, paper, black and white and colour photography. The works, including more than 63,000 paintings, photographs, films, pre-industrial and design objects, contemporary art installations, sculptures and 88,000 prints and drawings, are being stored, organised and displayed on the basis of their size and conservation requirements rather than theme or artist. Due to the lack of curating one would expect within such a collection, it is hoped that there will be an element of discovery and adventure for those looking around. Objects are displayed on movable racks, or in display cases, efficiently packed in, with objects sensitive to light or heat kept in cabinets, only to be inspected on appointment. \u201cYou\u2019ll go through the collection like you would visit a library looking for a book and finding three others,\u201d said Sjarel Ex, the museum\u2019s joint director. \u201cWe also decided to take private collectors, to give private collectors opportunities to work with us in the same building. So you see when you go around and you see the floors, you will meet with several collections that enjoy a collaboration with the museum.\u201d Boijmans is setting a global trend, says Ina Klaassen, the museum\u2019s second joint director. The Victoria and Albert Museum has been taking soundings from the Boijman over its plans for its own version, the Storehouse, in London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. \u201cBut we have had conversations with people from Korea, Stavanger, Norway, Singapore, they all came along, and yesterday there was a delegation from Qatar,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe did a symposium three months ago that was joined by over 200 colleagues in the world and with their staff,\u201d said Ex. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a new typology, that all museums [are considering].\u201d The idea had been first mooted in Rotterdam in 2004 as a solution to a typically Dutch problem: flooding. It has been an issue for decades and a major flood in the museum\u2019s cellars, the old depot, in 2009 was followed by many more. The Boijmans was spending an increasing amount of money on external warehouses. \u201cSo we went to the city and said: \u2018Well, we have this great idea. We think that we want to show more collection because the city actually owns the collection, well like 85%,\u2019\u201d said Klaassen. \u201cThey said: \u2018Well, that is interesting, but maybe you should start fundraising.\u2019\u201d The museum did so and has now ploughed \u20ac55m (\u00a350m) into its \u201copen storage\u201d facility, thanks in large part to a \u20ac27m donation from the De Verre Bergen Foundation. Inconveniences along the way included having to send back the mirrored glass for the facade on arrival from China as it was deemed to be too brown. In a nod to the danger of water to art, the round building\u2019s footprint is small, at just 40 metres, with a 10-metre overhang. The reflective facade is made up of 6,609 sq metres of glass, divided into 1,664 panels. Birches, grasses and pines planted on the building\u2019s roof help retain rainwater, which is used throughout the building. Winy Maas, the building\u2019s architect, described the Depot as a \u201cNoah\u2019s ark\u201d. But, however impressive, the Depot is not an alternative to the main museum, under renovation and not due to reopen until 2028, says Klaassen. \u201cThat is a completely different story,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t function without a museum.

The decision to detail the origin of the ingredients on its \u00a34 oven-ready chicken crown prompted a threat of boycott from some customers. The company, which has long prided itself on the sale of British produce including \u201c100% British fresh meat, milk and eggs\u201d, immediately backtracked, telling customers the non-EU part of the label was a mistake. \u201cThe wording on the packaging is an error for which we apologise. We are changing the packaging immediately,\u201d it tweeted.\nIt is understood that the labelling was a result of a \u201cmisinterpretation of packing and labelling regulations\u201d. After Brexit, label rules largely follow EU regulations \u2013 which state any food product marked British by flags or words must include a statement about the origin of any \u201cprimary\u201d ingredients that are not British. In Morrisons\u2019 case the name of the product included salt and pepper, so they are classed as \u201cprimary\u201d elements and their provenance must be stated on the label in 75% of the size of the font used for the word \u201cBritish\u201d. The incident is the latest sign of a new front in the culture wars opening on supermarket shelves with some who agree with packaging that celebrates Britishness and others who do not. On Tuesday Morrisons said it was fully compliant with labelling rules but did not want to get drawn into Brexit culture wars. \u201cOur chicken label is adhering to British packaging regulations, however we will be redesigning it to make it clear this is not a political commentary,\u201d it said. One customer, David Bright, said: \u201cI\u2019m done with shopping @Morrisons \u2026 I can live with union flags on bananas, but the gratuitous slight on the EU is too much.\u201d Another customer tweeted: \u201cHave I missed this new trend for our groceries to celebrate their exclusion of any EU condiments?\u201d Ghislaine Hull wondered why Morrisons made a point of advertising the fact the condiments it was using were both non-British and non-EU. \u201cAside from anything else I\u2019d have thought most normal people want to know where foodstuff IS from not where it isn\u2019t.\u201d Others liked the label because it was divisive. \u201cHave to say a very well done to Morrisons, this has upset all the right people.\u201d The controversy comes as supermarkets navigate the meaning of post-Brexit Britain in labelling. A Crosse & Blackwell survey this year revealed more than half of British shoppers are looking to buy more domestic food. But some are put off by what they see as a politicisation of food, objecting to labels celebrating Britishness. One customer described the union flag on Mornflake porridge oats as \u201cvery unpleasant and quite intimidating\u201d. And last summer Co-op supermarket was mocked in some quarters after it labelled a package of ice cubes as \u201cmade with British water\u201d. \u201cWhat next, British air?\u201d quipped one customer on social media. \u201cBrexit may be behind us now, but make no mistake: a divided country remains,\u201d Callum Saunders, head of planning at Zeal Creative, which works with Nestl\u00e9, Pringles and McCain, told The Grocer earlier this year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/morrisons-apologises-for-non-eu-salt-and-pepper-chicken-label", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:16:01Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Chronic\u2019 lack of investment in UK primary school libraries revealed", "article": "There is a \u201cchronic\u201d lack of investment in primary school libraries in the UK, with teachers often forced to buy reading materials for children with their own money, according to a new study. But an alliance between the National Literacy Trust (NLT) and Penguin Random House UK (PRH) is setting out to transform 1,000 school libraries, with organisers calling on the government, businesses and charities to back their efforts. Schools are not statutorily required to have a library on their premises, and the report, The Future of Primary School Libraries, reveals that four out of 10 have no dedicated library budget. Some respondents to the study said they were relying on donations from families or buying books from charity shops to stock their shelves. \u201cMost teachers spend their own money adding to these resources, owing to lack of school funding,\u201d said one. The lack has long been protested by authors, with current children\u2019s laureate Cressida Cowell writing in April to Boris Johnson asking him to dedicate \u00a3100m a year to revitalising \u201cdeteriorating\u201d primary school libraries across the country. According to the NLT, one in eight primary schools in England do not have a library, with the proportion climbing to one in four in schools with a higher proportion of pupils on free school meals. The NLT said that this is a sign of the \u201cwidening literacy attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers\u201d, which has been exacerbated by the disruption of Covid-19. The literacy charity has teamed up with PRH to call for large-scale public and private funding in order to equip 1,000 primary school libraries with training, new books and resources by 2025, supporting 500,000 pupils over the next four years. The alliance is already backed by Arts Council England, which has awarded more than \u00a3900,000 through its National Lottery Project Grant programme to expand the World of Stories project, run by PRH and the NLT. PRH is investing more than \u00a31m in additional support, and retail bank Chase has also pledged its support. World of Stories has already worked with 225 primary school libraries over the last three years.\n\u201cOne in 11 children on free school meals don\u2019t own a single book of their own. With the latest research \u2026 it paints a very concerning picture of how these children and young people are able to access new books and unlock a lifetime of potential through reading. Together, we are committed to changing this,\u201d said NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas. Pledging support for the initiative Alison Tarrant, chief executive of the School Library Association, said that school libraries are in desperate need of funding. \u201cPrimary school libraries are essential to children\u2019s literacy and learning and yet the recent research continues to highlight disparity across the UK, impacting the development of reading and writing skills, wellbeing as well as overall academic attainment,\u201d she said. Last week\u2019s budget from chancellor Rishi Sunak promised large sums to \u201crenovate, restore and revive\u201d public libraries but none of that money will be allocated to schools. A Department for Education representative said: \u201cIndividual schools will decide how best to provide and maintain access to books for their pupils. To support schools in making sure children get the education they deserve, we are providing an additional \u00a34.7bn in school funding by 2024-25, investment that will support teachers and resources such as library provision.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/02/chronic-lack-of-investment-in-uk-primary-school-libraries", "last_update": "2021-11-03T09:23:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "No 10 set to break promise of 6,000 more GPs in England, Sajid Javid says", "article": "No 10 is likely to break its promise to increase the number of GPs in England by 6,000, Sajid Javid has admitted. The health secretary disclosed that the figure, a key promise in the Conservatives\u2019 general election manifesto in 2019, was unlikely to be met given the number of GPs retiring early. He made the disclosure while giving evidence to the cross-party Commons health select committee. Asked by the committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, if the government was on track to implement the 6,000 pledge, Javid relied: \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to pretend that we\u2019re on track when we are clearly not.\u201d Increasing the number of GPs in England by 6,000 by 2025 was one of the commitments to improve the NHS Boris Johnson repeatedly made in the election campaign. Others included expanding the nursing workforce by 50,000 and offering 50m more GP appointments a year. Labour accused Javid of having \u201ccasually dropped\u201d the pledge. \u201cIt is staggering that Javid has abandoned Boris Johnson\u2019s key election promise to recruit 6,000 extra GPs\u201d, said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. \u201cPatients struggling to get an appointment will be appalled that this promise has been so casually dropped.\u201d The British Medical Association, which is at loggerheads with Javid over his plan to force GPs to see more patients face-to-face, said unmanageably heavy workloads were prompting growing numbers of experienced doctors to quit. \u201cThe latest workforce figures for England show that we have lost the equivalent of more than 1,800 full-time, fully qualified GPs since 2015, despite pledges to increase numbers by 6,000\u201d, said Dr Richard Vautrey, the chair of the BMA\u2019s GPs committee. \u201cSo while the health secretary\u2019s admission today is long overdue, it is absolutely not news to GPs and their colleagues working in surgeries across the country that have been decimated by workforce shortages. \u201cThe bottom line is we are haemorrhaging doctors in general practice. While more younger doctors may be choosing to enter general practice, even more experienced GPs are leaving the profession or reducing their hours to manage unsustainable workloads.\u201d He blamed the growing numbers taking early retirement on the government\u2019s failure to include measures to relieve the pressure on GP surgeries in its recent plan to guarantee in-person consultations for patients who want one. \u201cA failure to show any meaningful support for GPs or efforts to retain experienced doctors \u2013 something completely absent in the government\u2019s recent \u2018rescue plan\u2019 that has been overwhelmingly rejected by the profession \u2013 ultimately impacts how easy it is for patients to access their GP practice.\u201d Javid also: \u2022 Confirmed he is pressing ahead with plans, opposed by GPs, to publish details showing how many patients each surgery in England sees face-to-face. \u2022 Claimed that \u201ca significant proportion of people are turning up for emergency care when they could have gone to their GP\u201d. \u2022 Announced that NHS England would be publishing an \u201celective recovery plan\u201d by the end of the month to tackle the 5.7m-strong backlog of operations. \u2022 Warned that the coming winter \u201cwill be extra tough\u201d compared with normal. During the evidence session, Hunt recalled how, when he was health secretary, he had to break the promise he had made in 2015 to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020. He attributed that to the increasing number of doctors opting to go part-time or retire early. He cited the results of a BMA survey published in May, which found that more than a third of GPs planned to go part-time over the next year to reduce their workloads. Javid\u2019s rowback on the pledge came as research showed that many GPs were cutting back on the amount of time they spent dealing directly with patients in order to protect their mental health. Exhausted GPs were displaying \u201cresilience surface acting\u201d \u2013 pretending to cope with work pressures better than they actually were \u2013 in order not to be seen as weak, the study found. GPs \u201cappear to be resolving this issue by reducing their clinical working hours\u201d, according to the findings, published online in the British Journal of General Practice on Tuesday. Warning of the \u201chuge implications\u201d of this trend, the authors added: \u201cThe cumulative effects of fewer mid-career GP hours worked, combined with increased retirement and reduced intake into the profession from newly qualified doctors, are potentially grave concerns for the stability of the overall GP workforce, the NHS and the health of the UK population as a whole.\u201d The research was undertaken by Lucy Martin, a GP in the West Midlands, and Almuth McDowall, a professor of organisational psychology at Birkbeck, University of London. They based their findings on qualitative interviews with 27 GPs about their resilience. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising to hear that the government are not on track to keep their pledge of 6,000 more GPs by 2024. This has been clear for some time. But it is disappointing. The college has consistently been raising the alarm about the intense workload and workforce pressures facing general practice \u2013 and the impact it is having on patients \u2013 while the government focuses on \u2018sticking plaster\u2019 solutions to address them that do not address the fundamental challenges.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/02/no-10-set-to-break-promise-of-6000-more-gps-in-england-sajid-javid-says", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:09:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Titled The Guardians, the exhibition is inspired by mythological figures designed to protect from evil.

He rates those spiral bound diaries \u2013 which he fills in with texta sketches of potential sculptural works \u2013 as his most useful object. Here, he tells us why those pages are so hard to part with, as well as the stories of a few other important personal belongings.

But what would be in this suitcase? I\u2019ve made an effort to surround my home with inspiring handmade objects and artworks from various parts of the world. I just acquired the most beautiful traditional Tibetan rug, which was made in India by Tibetan refugees. I love that this tradition is being sustained. It\u2019s hand knotted and has two regal tigers amongst bamboo on it. Tigers are one of my favourite animals. So when my friend linked me to the Instagram account of Tim Roodenrys, where it was being sold, I pounced on it. I would also hurriedly put artworks I own in this (big) suitcase. I don\u2019t have any of my own pieces in my home. I look at my work all day in the studio, so I prefer to have artwork made by other people in my living space. But I only really collect handmade things. I\u2019d have to make room in the suitcase for an etching I recently bought by Ms N. Yunupingu and a vase made for me by my friend James Lemon. My most useful object This is where I lean into the clich\u00e9d artist category! I have always kept visual diaries. My mind incessantly chucks ideas, images, thoughts and fantasies at me. Some of these ideas suck, but that\u2019s just the nature of things. My best ideas often emerge at unpredictable times. The ideas can come like earthquakes. They make me want to run into the studio and start making. I remember being at a party once and having to find a moment to draw a multi-headed figure. I wanted to make it on my phone so I wouldn\u2019t forget it.\nWhat I have found most useful are spiral bound diaries with blank pages and packets of humble textas. Nothing fancy! When I was a kid, I would draw and scribble all day with these textas. And I still do! I love the sounds these markers make when you drag them across a page. I never get sentimentally attached to my artworks, but I am so sentimental about my diaries. The Powerhouse Museum recently acquired four of my diaries alongside a recent work. It was like giving away my babies. I feel like within these diaries are drawings that can birth infinite new sculptural works. The item I most regret losing I\u2019m currently in the process of compiling my artist archive. This collection of small sculptural maquettes, diaries and other bits of relevant studio detritus will soon go into a collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. As I sift through all this material, I just wish I had the first ceramic I ever made. I\u2019m not sure how reliable my memory is, but I seem to clearly recall this work.\nI made it during a short weekend ceramics course called \u201cclay for kids\u201d somewhere in western Sydney when I was about 10 years old. I don\u2019t think I was particularly talented with clay at the time, but I remember loving the smell of it. The work was a head with big lips and curly hair. It was about the size of my adult fist and was glazed badly with a glassy brown. It was super wonky, but I was chuffed when it came out of the kiln. I also wish I had some of my scribbly childhood drawings. I\u2019d love to see those!", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/03/my-house-fire-situation-would-resemble-a-comedic-skit-ramesh-mario-nithiyendrans-treasures", "last_update": "2021-11-02T21:12:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Royal Melbourne hospital down 51 staff who won\u2019t comply with Covid vaccine mandate", "article": "A major Melbourne hospital is down 51 staff who are refusing to be vaccinated against Covid, a requirement to work in Victorian healthcare facilities. The state government directive applies to all workers including contractors and those who are self-employed, and covers roles such as administration and retail staff within healthcare settings, doctors, nurses and people doing diagnostic imaging. The deadline for health workers to receive a first dose in Victoria was Friday 29 October. A Royal Melbourne hospital spokesperson said eight staff had chosen not to get vaccinated and had resigned, a further eight had their employment terminated after stating they would not get the jab, and another 35 staff had been stood down.\n\u201cThis is to allow them to potentially rethink their position and us, as an organisation, to go through the process that may potentially lead to further terminations of employment,\u201d the spokesperson said. The 51 staff impacted represents just 0.45% of the hospital\u2019s 11,000-strong workforce. They held a range of roles including nursing, administration, ward clerks and clinical positions \u2013 though none were doctors. A professor of epidemiology with the University of Sydney, Alexandra Martinuik, said the staff losses at the Royal Melbourne hospital were reasonable. \u201cA kind gesture from the hospital could be to reach out to these staff to ask them if they have any questions about vaccination, or if there is anything more the hospital could do to help them choose immunisation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if these staff continue to choose not to be immunised then I do think it is reasonable for someone working in healthcare to resign, or be stood down if they are not Covid vaccinated and they don\u2019t have a medical exemption, as it is much less safe for them and their patients and colleagues if not immunised.\u201d Guardian Australia asked a number of major hospitals about the impact of the vaccine mandate in Victoria. The Royal Melbourne hospital was the only institution to provide a response. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIn New South Wales, the impact of the mandate on health worker numbers is being collated by the state\u2019s health department. A NSW Health spokesperson said work was under way to reconcile data from across local health districts, networks and organisations. \u201cWith regard to the final number of people who may no longer work with NSW Health as they decided not to be vaccinated against Covid-19, this will become clear once this work is complete,\u201d the department said. \u201cThis is because not all these people will resign due to their views, and each person\u2019s particular circumstances need to be worked through by the local health districts and due process needs to be applied to all employees.\u201d The data would be made available \u201cin due course,\u201d the spokesperson said. In early October, NSW Health said fewer than 0.1% of its staff had resigned as a result of the Covid vaccination mandate, contradicting claims opposition to the jab could lead to staff shortages.\nOn Monday, Queensland\u2019s health minister, Yvette D\u2019Ath, said more than 7,000 health staff were yet to confirm their vaccination status as required and about 4,000 were set to receive show-cause notices and be suspended on full pay. \u201cWe will put in place measures to manage any workforce shortages that might occur,\u201d the minister said. Mandatory Coivd-19 vaccination for health workers is a move supported by the Australian Medical Association, with president Omar Khorshid saying legal protection should also be given to healthcare employers who mandate vaccinations. The AMA has welcomed mandatory health worker vaccinations in Victoria, NSW, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland but want a nationally consistent policy that applies to GPs and practice staff, pharmacists, hospital staff, ambulance staff, cooks and cleaners, with no exemptions except for legitimate medical reasons.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/royal-melbourne-hospital-down-51-staff-who-wont-comply-with-covid-vaccine-mandate", "last_update": "2021-11-02T07:29:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Coalition split over religious discrimination bill with MPs having \u2018serious concerns\u2019 over Folau clause", "article": "Coalition MPs are split over the government\u2019s revised religious discrimination bill, with the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, holding urgent meetings with MPs before parliament returns to try to resolve the issue. The push to introduce a bill in the final sitting fortnight this year comes almost three years after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised to introduce a new religious discrimination act after a review into religious freedom undertaken by Philip Ruddock in 2018. Cash, who took over the bill\u2019s progress from Christian Porter when she became attorney general in March, is now consulting on a third iteration of the draft legislation in an attempt to overcome internal resistance and fulfil an election promise. Three issues are understood to face some resistance within the party room: the inclusion of a \u201cFolau clause\u201d that would give legal protection to someone expressing a statement of belief; conscientious objection provisions that would allow health practitioners to refuse to provide certain treatment; and the ability for religious institutions to discriminate against staff on the basis of religion to maintain a \u201cfaith-based ethos\u201d.\nThe Australian Christian Lobby has boasted it successfully pressured the government into including a Folau clause \u2013 a provision that would legally protect an individual from having their employment terminated as a result of them expressing their religious views. The issue gained prominence after footballer Israel Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia for social media posts suggesting homosexuals, adulterers, atheists and other \u201csinners\u201d would go to hell. Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who attended one of a number of briefings with Cash this week, said he did not support the Folau clause. \u201cI just have serious concerns about a number of issues in relation to it [the bill] and the Folau clause is a major concern,\u201d Entsch told Guardian Australia. He said his position had not changed after previously indicating he would not support a bill that \u201creimposed\u201d any discrimination through a religious discrimination act. Other MPs and senators, including Andrew Bragg, Dean Smith, Tim Wilson and Dave Sharma are understood to hold similar reservations.\nThe third draft of the bill, which is still being finalised by Cash, comes more than two years after Porter released the government\u2019s first exposure draft in early 2019. That bill, which was described as \u201cfriendless\u201d, received almost 6,000 submissions during the consultation process and was later revised after the backlash. The government\u2019s second exposure draft, designed to appease concerns of religious groups, was roundly criticised by the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australian Medical Association and LGBTQ+ groups. Conservative MPs, however, are pushing for the bill to be made a priority, warning that faith communities were expecting Morrison to deliver on the promise made before the last election. It is understood that WA senator Matt O\u2019Sullivan spoke to the party room during the past sitting fortnight about the issue, questioning the government\u2019s priorities after it signed off on a bill relating to the legalising of mitochondrial donation. Before the last election, Morrison penned a five-page letter to the heads of churches, promising to legislate a religious discrimination act as an election commitment. He said in the letter that he would introduce legislation \u201cto make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a person\u2019s religious belief or activity, including on the basis that a person does not hold any religious belief or does not engage in any religious activity\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nSouth Sydney Anglican Bishop Michael Stead would not comment on his discussions with the government on the legislation but said the bill was \u201cwell and truly overdue\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s indefensible that there is not protection for religious freedom,\u201d Stead told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are very keen to see this resolved during this term of government, we don\u2019t want this to be an election issue and we would hope for bipartisan support, for the Labor party\u2019s support of the bill. \u201cWe recognise that Covid has had an impact, we are not insensitive to the fact that a whole lot of the government\u2019s legislative timetable and commitments have been disrupted, but that is why we are very keen to see it resolved now.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/coalition-split-over-religious-discrimination-bill-with-one-mp-having-serious-concerns-over-folau-clause", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:17:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Yuletide logjam: how supply chain woes could ruin Christmas for Australian shoppers", "article": "Australians trying to order goods could face a nightmare before Christmas, as shortages caused by blockages in global supply chains continue to bite. The pandemic has stretched supply chains to breaking point, which may make some goods scarce until 2023. Shoppers are still complaining of empty shelves, long after the toilet paper buying frenzies and personal protective equipment shortages of 2020. There are shortfalls of goods from medicines to coffee, to electronics and bicycles and clothes. Dan Murphy\u2019s has said some alcohol products will be hard to source, and Australia Post has warned presents may not make it in time to go under the Christmas tree.\nThere is no single reason for the shortages, but rather a combination of factors arising from the global disruption caused by the pandemic and local obstacles such as state border closures and industrial disputes on the wharves. The chief economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Jarrod Ball, says there was a \u201cmassive shift of consumption\u201d into goods over services during Australia\u2019s lockdowns, as governments pumped out wage and benefit subsidies and restrictions prevented spending on travel and hospitality. But as demand for goods grew, the problems with supply got steadily worse. The chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, Paul Zahra, says that has caused a nightmare for his members. \u201cOur supply chains are under incredible pressure at the moment and there\u2019s a myriad of issues at play here that are creating the perfect storm for retailers and consumers.\u201d Where are the bottlenecks? Most of Australia\u2019s imports come from China, followed by the US. As an island, Australia is particularly vulnerable to shipping delays, all the more so when the number of flights arriving in the country has been drastically curtailed. \u201cAt a global level, retailers are reporting that the capping of incoming flights has put significant pressure on shipping, and we are seeing container costs escalating up to four times their usual rate,\u201d Zahra says. The price of shipping containers has exploded, as has the cost of chartering a ship to move things around the world, as the domestic spending boom on consumer goods in the US and the general disruption to pre-pandemic flows of containers has caused logjams of container ships in US ports, and shortages elsewhere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nWhen containers do arrive, they face more delays at Australia\u2019s ports. The Maritime Union of Australia is locked in a battle over pay and conditions, with rolling strikes set to continue this month. Pallets, the wooden containers used to transport many items, are also suddenly undergoing a mismatch of supply and demand. \u201cThe pallets are a really good example of all these factors coming together in a way people might not have foreseen,\u201d Ball says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a massive spike for consumer goods but at the same time a big lift in demand for timber due to lots of building and the renovations that are going on. \u201cAdd to that disruption to the factories that make the pallets, and that all adds up to a pallet shortage.\u201d\nCovid itself continues to have a direct effect on crucial links in the chain. Distribution centres have been shut down, or staff forced to isolate, slowing the flow of goods. Australia Post has been overwhelmed at times during lockdown restrictions, and courier companies are also feeling the strain. \u201cSome distribution centres and warehouses have been impacted by reduced staffing levels due to Covid cases, we\u2019ve had industrial disputes from delivery drivers and port workers, while state border controls and limited domestic flights are also impacting the movement of goods,\u201d Zahra says. Finally, there is a shortage of the right people for the right jobs. Infrastructure Australia warned in October that two in three key occupations necessary for construction were \u201clikely or potentially in shortage\u201d. There are nationwide shortages of engineers and architects, and potential shortages of bricklayers, concreters, carpenters, electricians and other tradies. Which products are worst affected? Cars and electronics The pandemic has increased demand as people buy more computer products to work from home or entertain themselves in lockdowns. But the global dearth of semiconductors used in electronics such as whitegoods, phones and cars means even Apple has struggled to get chips for iPhones, Macs and iPads. All computer manufacturers are facing similar difficulties. Toyota Australia says current demand exceeds supply, with long delays for parts. People are waiting months for some of its most popular models. Nissan, General Motors and Volkswagen are all facing delays. Food and groceries The Australian Food and Grocery Council has pulled together a taskforce to deal with supply problems, including the pallet crisis, which is hampering supermarkets shifting goods around the country. The council\u2019s chief executive, Tanya Barden, says Covid staff shortages and shutdowns mean products have been kept in storage on pallets for longer. \u201cThe issues include impacts on global shipping and sector shutdowns based on health authority orders,\u201d she says. She hopes that as states open up, pallets will be emptied and put back into distribution. \u201cNew measures for management of Covid close contacts in the workplace should also have beneficial flow-on effects to address pressures on labour capacity issues in supply chains.\u201d Specific issues have further complicated the picture for other products, including coffee and some alcohol brands. Building materials Even before Covid, Australia was facing timber shortages because of the 2019-20 bushfires, which burned commercial plantations as well as native forests. Demand for construction materials skyrocketed during the pandemic as the federal government poured stimulus money into construction. That happened globally, too, so imports couldn\u2019t make up the shortfall.\nSteel and other construction supplies are also in short supply. Steel mills around the world wound back production when Covid hit, expecting things would slow down, the Australian Steel Association chief, David Buchanan, has said. But then the stimulus money did what it was intended to do, and demand soared. The Australian Institute of Architects has warned that insulation, bricks and plaster board could also face shortages. When will it end? In July, the Productivity Commission warned that increasingly complex global supply chains meant they were more at risk from trade wars, natural disasters, financial crises, pandemics and infrastructure-related failures such as cyberattacks. Ball says the consensus is the shortages will not end anytime soon. \u201cIt won\u2019t really be until 2023 that we start to see some moderation in this,\u201d he says, warning that even then there is a risk of worker shortages in service industries. Zahra says the only thing consumers can do is try to plan ahead wherever possible. \u201cIt\u2019s the season to shop early,\u201d he says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/yuletide-logjam-how-supply-chain-woes-could-ruin-christmas-for-australian-shoppers", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:36:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Budget monitor: post-lockdown bounce tipped for Australia ahead of deficits hitting $60bn a year", "article": "Australia\u2019s federal budget is set for a post-lockdown bounce before settling into deficits of $60bn a year due to higher social services and defence spending, an independent analysis has warned. Deloitte Access Economics\u2019 budget monitor, released on Tuesday, projects cumulative deficits will be $45bn lower than expected over the next four years as momentum built before the Delta wave is unleashed through a sustained recovery in a highly vaccinated society. But in 2024-25 the deficit will be at least $36bn on announced policies and it\u2019s tipped to reach $60bn including $25bn of new spending not yet announced.\nThe federal government will then have an \u201congoing shortfall\u201d so large it would require interventions as drastic as raising the GST to 17% or raising marginal income tax rates by 5.5% to wipe out the deficit. The report calls into question the sustainability of stage three income tax cuts \u2013 which flatten the tax rate to 30% for all workers earning between $45,000 and $200,000 \u2013 supported by both the Coalition and Labor. Deloitte forecasts the budget deficit will shrink from $116bn in 2021-22 to $49bn in 2024-25 because \u201cwhen nations get sufficiently ahead of Covid for their economies to open up, their tax revenues go on a tear\u201d. In the medium and long term, Australia\u2019s budget will be in deficit \u2013 not because of Covid spending measures, as the cost of servicing Australia\u2019s debt actually decreased due to low interest rates \u2013 but due to baked-in spending. The May budget added $15bn a year to ongoing spending on social services, with large investments in disability, mental health and aged care, in part to rectify historical underspending identified by the royal commission. Deloitte warned of \u201ca fast widening gap between what experts expect the NDIS to cost and what\u2019s budgeted for it\u201d, a gap also noted by the government services minister, Linda Reynolds, who has suggested \u201chard discussions\u201d will be needed to make the scheme sustainable. The fastest-growing budget item, defence, is expected to continue to grow as the Aukus pact responds to dangers in the Indo-Pacific region with higher spending. Australia will also have almost one million fewer people due to Covid border closures, Deloitte projected, which will weigh on the budget. Deloitte warned that income tax cuts to battle bracket creep are \u201coverdelivering\u201d because \u201cbracket creep is driven by wage growth, but that\u2019s slumped to record lows\u201d. \u201cWorse still, the national debate on these tax cuts focussed on fairness, whereas the problem with these tax cuts was always their size,\u201d it said. \u201cSo just when we should be turning our minds to how to pay for higher social and defence spending, we\u2019ll deliver a tax cut that\u2019s too big.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nDeloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson told Guardian Australia that the nation didn\u2019t \u201cneed fiscal repair any time soon\u201d because the top priority was to \u201crepair the economy\u201d. Richardson said stage three tax cuts, set to take effect in 2024-25, and how to finance the deficit if they proceeded, were \u201cthe story of the next election\u201d. \u201cDo not let either side of politics hide from the difficult questions \u2026 there are no easy answers \u2026 important decisions need to be made and they won\u2019t be fun.\u201d There is disquiet within the Morrison government\u2019s own ranks about the size of programs to combat the Covid recession including the $90bn jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, which Deloitte said could have been better targeted but played a \u201cstarring role\u201d in supporting the economy. In September 2020 the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, signalled the Coalition will continue to prioritise reducing the unemployment rate ahead of debt reduction, promising that it will not begin the work of substantial debt and deficit reduction until the unemployment rate was \u201ccomfortably\u201d back under 6%.\nLabor, burned at the 2019 election for proposing wide-ranging tax changes to franking credits, negative gearing and capital gains tax has ditched all these revenue-raising measures and promised not to scrap the stage three tax cuts. Frydenberg said the monitor was \u201ca further vote of confidence in Australia\u2019s economic resilience\u201d and showed \u201ctemporary, targeted and proportionate economic support has underpinned our strong economic recovery\u201d. \u201cLower taxes and investment in skills and infrastructure will continue to support the economy as we recover from the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression,\u201d the treasurer said. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the budget monitor \u201cconfirms the significant challenges Australians face\u201d and that improvements in the near term were \u201cdespite the Morrison government not because of it\u201d. \u201cThis government has promised eight surpluses but delivered none, real wages are going backwards, and year after year its budgets have been weighed down by waste and riddled with rorts,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/03/budget-monitor-post-lockdown-bounce-tipped-for-australia-ahead-of-deficits-hitting-60bn-a-year", "last_update": "2021-11-02T21:30:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "How do I motivate my kids without becoming a nag? The key is to make peace with slow progress | Conal Hanna", "article": "How can I get my young kids out the door without running late for once? Dentists recommend brushing children\u2019s teeth for two minutes at a time. Doing my four-year-old son\u2019s can take 20. If that sounds orally retentive on my part, rest assured very few of the 20 minutes are actually spent brushing. (Truth be told, it\u2019s likely fewer than two.) Usually there are several minutes of asking, followed by a few gentle reminders, several increasingly terse requests, and then a melange of pleading, bribery and blackmail. By that stage he\u2019s at least in the bathroom.\nApproximately three seconds after the toothbrush makes contact with its targets come the questions. Nowhere on the toothpaste tube does it specify that fluoride stimulates curiosity in children\u2019s brains, but I can confirm the correlation. I can\u2019t be mad at him, of course, because he\u2019s not doing anything naughty. He\u2019s just being a delightfully distracted four-year-old boy with zero concept of time or what it means to be late for work. I envy him, if anything, and don\u2019t want to impinge upon his carefree childhood outlook with my banal adult agenda. It would, however, be nice not to start every day with a dose of frustration mixed with cortisol as we scramble to get to work. Not long after we had his elder sister, our first, I remember lamenting to a colleague at work about the early wake-up calls. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be screaming at them to get out the door in no time.\u201d Such was my naivety, I thought this was a joke \u2013 that she was referring to the teenage years, and how they grow up so fast. Turns out, not so much. Of all the least fun parenting roles to play, that of the nagger is surely right up there. Even I hate the sound of my own voice. This cuts to the central irony of parenthood, an activity which expands your very understanding of love, connection and purpose \u2013 helping you identify what\u2019s truly important in life \u2013 only to simultaneously lump you with such copious quantities of tedious shit that you soon forget all about it. Especially when much of the tedium takes far longer than it needs to! I\u2019ve seen Bluey, OK. I know it\u2019s the tedium that\u2019s the problem. And when I\u2019m my best parenting self I even have Bandit\u2019s capacity to turn household chores into fun adventures that capture their imagination. But who has the energy for that all the time? Catching up with my mate Pete at the park later, at least I know I\u2019m not alone. I can tell this because his son is wearing pyjamas. While lamenting our inability to inspire action in our offspring, we marvel at how their preschool teachers somehow make it look so effortless. \u201cThey\u2019re like child whisperers,\u201d suggests Pete, and it\u2019s true. They don\u2019t raise their voice, never seem to nag, and yet somehow they manage to coerce not just one but 20 small children to carry out their wishes. It\u2019s only later that I decide to stop lamenting and start asking. I decide to wage a war on faffing.\nVicki Schaefer is hardly what you\u2019d consider a drill sergeant. A softly spoken preschool teacher of 22 years, and the creator of Little Wise One, Vicki appears a model of serenity as she goes about her job. Talking to her about parenting is a bit like watching Bluey: soothing and reinvigorating, if capable of provoking mild feelings of shame at my own relative impatience. She is, however, very kind, and willing to share some of her wisdom. Vicki\u2019s tips for motivating little people into action Eye level is super important. Get down to them \u2013 it helps them feel \u201cseen\u201d. Tell them what you want them to do, not what you don\u2019t want. \u201cPut your feet on the ground\u201d instead of \u201cdon\u2019t climb on that\u201d. Five words or less works well. \u201cI need you to\u2026\u201d In times of conflict over choices, give them two (no more) options \u2013 both that work for you. They feel empowered as the final choice is still theirs. Pause before responding. \u201cBreathe, listen, respond.\u201d Model all behaviours. Children see, hear and copy everything you do. Lastly, speak with love and kindness. Preschoolers have only been on the planet four years which isn\u2019t that long. They might be capable of many things, but we need to remember there\u2019s still so much for them to learn. I love how practical some of these are. We\u2019re trying them and they do work \u2026 sometimes. Our house is not yet a zen temple, but we\u2019re slowly making progress. And we\u2019re OK with that. For many of us, the early years of parenthood are about making peace with \u201cslowly making progress\u201d. There is value in lowering your expectations of how much you can get done in a day. This has not come naturally \u2013 both my wife and I like to be busy. But there are unexpected benefits to leaving more free time.

{"title": "Latin American countries join reserves to create vast marine protected area", "article": "Four Pacific-facing Latin American nations have committed to joining their marine reserves to form one interconnected area, creating one of the world\u2019s richest pockets of ocean biodiversity. Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica announced on Tuesday the creation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR) initiative, which would both join and increase the size of their protected territorial waters to create a fishing-free corridor covering more than 500,000 sq km (200,000 sq miles) in one of the world\u2019s most important migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks and rays. The move comes amid growing clamour for action to protect rare marine species and commercial fish populations against foreign fishing fleets exploiting the region\u2019s rich marine biodiversity, as well as to limit illegal, under-reported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by local fishing communities. The president of Colombia, Iv\u00e1n Duque, announced an additional 160,000 sq km of marine protected area on top of the country\u2019s existing 120,000 sq km at Cop26 in Glasgow on Tuesday. The day before, Ecuador\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, took the first step by announcing the expansion of the current 133,000 sq km Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve by 60,000 sq km.\n\u201cJust as all the world leaders here have called for action not words, I believe this is a concrete action on behalf of Ecuador that goes beyond any words we can say here,\u201d Lasso told the Guardian after the announcement. \u201cThis is a sovereign decision of the Ecuadorian government but I have to point out that it is the result of five months of dialogue, which we\u2019ve held with small-scale and industrial fishermen. For that reason I don\u2019t expect any problem of rejection or protest because it is a consensual decision,\u201d he said. Lasso added that the plan for a wider joined-up reserve was \u201can absolutely direct response of middle-income countries with a commitment to humanity\u201d to the increased presence of industrial fishing fleets. He said the expansion involved one of the world\u2019s largest debt swaps for conservation, but did not give any details or figures. The expansion creates a \u201csafe swimway\u201d connecting Ecuadorian with Costa Rican waters, where \u201cimportant endangered migratory species, such as sharks, whales, turtles and manta rays travel\u201d, said Ecuador\u2019s environment minister, Gustavo Manrique. \u201cIn spite of the fact we\u2019re a developing country, despite the fact we have [one of] the largest [fishing] fleets in the Pacific, we have decided to reduce the fishing effort,\u201d Manrique told the Guardian.\n\u201cThis is the new language of global conservation. Never have countries with connecting maritime borders joined together to create a public policy.\u201d This new Gal\u00e1pagos protected area would be split into two: a no-take zone of 30,000 sq km to the north-east of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands connecting Ecuador\u2019s waters with those of Costa Rica, along the underwater seamounts of the Cocos Ridge, a key migration route for ocean-going species. Another 30,000 sq km area is a no-longline fishing zone wrapping north-west around the existing Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve. Alex Hearn, a British marine biologist who has worked in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands for two decades, said it was a step forward. \u201cThis is a moment to relish, but there\u2019s a lot of work which needs to be done.\u201d Hearn said the eastern tropical Pacific was \u201cone of the last bastions of what ocean biodiversity would look like in a pristine world\u201d, and described the seas that connect the Gal\u00e1pagos, Malpelo, Cocos and Coiba islands as a living laboratory for scientific research. \u201cJust protecting the waters around them is not enough. There\u2019s a connectivity between the areas and that\u2019s what we need to protect,\u201d he said.\nHearn noted that the populations of highly migratory species had been falling this century, among them turtles, rays and sharks, particularly the critically endangered hammerhead species that congregates to breed around the Gal\u00e1pagos\u2019s Darwin and Colombia\u2019s Malpelo islands. In June, as part of the UK-led \u201c30x30\u201d initiative to secure at least 30% of the world\u2019s ocean as protected marine areas by 2030, Panama more than quadrupled the Cordillera de Coiba marine protected area \u2013 from about 17,220 sq km to 98,230 sq km. Max Bello, an ocean policy advisor with the NGO Mission Blue, said: \u201cWith this commitment, Latin America again consolidates its leadership in marine conservation, but more is needed. We are hoping to continue towards at least 30% of protection in all of the [maritime] countries.\u201d \u201cA new era \u2013 to provide protection to species which know no frontiers \u2013 has been born,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/four-latin-american-countries-join-protected-marine-reserves-to-create-mega-mpa", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:31:18Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Social media companies \u2018make money from hate\u2019, says Thierry Henry ", "article": "Thierry Henry has accused social media companies of making money from hate and said he has no plans to end his boycott of the industry because platforms are \u201cnot really trying\u201d to tackle online abuse. The former Arsenal star and World Cup winner announced a social media boycott in March in protest at the platforms\u2019 failure to tackle racist abuse, triggering a wave of similar moves that culminated in a weekend-long blackout by football and other sports in the UK on 30 April. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Henry said the business model of social media companies was a barrier to action. \u201cWhen you find that they generate money through hate, it is very difficult when your medicine is your poison.\u201d He added: \u201cBeing genuine and being nice doesn\u2019t generate money.\u201d Henry, 44, currently an assistant coach for the Belgian national team, said previous attempts to talk to social media firms had met with silence before his boycott. \u201cI tried to reach [out] at times. They didn\u2019t want to talk, but when the boycott happened they wanted to talk to me. I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t know what we need to talk about now\u2019.\u201d Henry said social media companies had not done enough since launching his boycott, which he said he would end once platforms started tackling racism and bullying properly. Speaking at a press conference after his Web Summit appearance, Henry said there had been no action. \u201cThey are not really trying to change anything about it.\u201d Asked if he would return to social media, he said: \u201cI am OK without it. I sleep well.\u201d Henry also welcomed Monday\u2019s report in the Times that online trolls could face a two-year jail sentence for posting content or sending messages that caused psychological harm. The criminal clauses would be included in the online safety bill, which Boris Johnson has promised to fast-track through parliament. Asked if he would support two-year sentences, Henry said: \u201cYes I would. I think that\u2019s a big and massive start.\u201d He said people shouting abuse in the street would be arrested or told to stop by police, but online \u201cit seems you can do whatever you want\u201d. Referring to the speed at which videos are removed from sites for breaching copyright, Henry added that social media companies would act if something had an \u201cimpact on their pockets\u201d. Speaking in support of Puma\u2019s Game of Our Lives anti-online hate initiative, he also expressed scepticism that Instagram would deal with complaints by Wilfried Zaha, the Crystal Palace forward, over abuse he received after his team defeated Manchester City at the weekend. Zaha has been told by Instagram to report each instance of abuse after the game. Henry said: \u201cYou need to report it for each [abusive] message \u2013 if they do answer.\u201d A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said: \u201cNo one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don\u2019t want it on our platforms. We remove hateful content as soon as we find it and respond quickly to valid legal requests to help with police investigations.\u201d It is also understood that Instagram has banned all the accounts that sent abuse to Zaha. Nick Clegg, the vice-president of global affairs at Meta, used his Web Summit appearance to defend the business against renewed criticism from the whistleblower Frances Haugen, who spoke in Lisbon on Monday. Clegg denied Haugen\u2019s claims that Facebook deliberately \u201cspoonfeeds\u201d hateful content to keep them on the platform. Clegg said advertisers, who account for most of Meta\u2019s $86bn (\u00a363bn) annual revenues, did not want their ads placed next to extreme content. \u201cIt misreads the commercial self-interest of Meta,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/social-media-companies-make-money-from-hate-says-thierry-henry", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:02:08Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The reverse at West Ham was in the Carabao Cup via a penalty shootout but Palace won 2-0 in the Premier League with a convincing display when City were reduced to 10 men and decidedly second-best. Guardiola said he was content before his side host Club Brugge in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League group game. \u201cWe are playing at an incredible level \u2013 the way we have been playing in the last month, month and a half,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI would say one of the best moments, maybe the best moment since we\u2019ve been here. The results are many things, circumstances, and we have to improve. Our solidity, in terms of the process, we are doing really, really well.\u201d Guardiola denied any frustration that results have not recently matched quality. \u201cFootball is a game where you win and lose. I\u2019m only concerned about the way we play. Defeat was tough but we know the calendar, how busy it is. We want to finish this run well with the [Manchester] United game [on Saturday] before the international break.\u201d City beat Brugge 5-1 two weeks ago and are second in Group A, a point behind Paris Saint-Germain and two ahead of the Belgian club. \u201cThis is more important than United \u2013 this game gives us an incredible possibility to make a step forward to qualify for the last 16,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIn the Premier League there are many games; in this competition just six [in the group] and now three left: they are decisive, three and four \u2013 the most important games.\u201d Despite stating City are in their best moment, Guardiola found fault when reviewing the win at Brugge. \u201cSome things we have to improve: defensively, our pressing, it\u2019s normal, every game,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the game against Brugge and saw many bad things we have done.\u201d\nKyle Walker, who played in the match, said the squad might discover later on Tuesday what the manager meant. \u201cWe will have to wait for today\u2019s training session and find out,\u201d the said. \u201cHe has probably been doing his homework and picked up on something to help the team.\u201d Walker is confident Jack Grealish, who cost a British record \u00a3100m will find his best form, having scored twice and made three assists in 14 appearances. \u201cI can assure you he is a nightmare for defenders,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHe has not played badly, he\u2019s probably not quite hit the assists and goal levels he was getting at Aston Villa, but we like to share the load here.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/pep-guardiola-bullish-manchester-city-club-brugge-champions-league", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:03:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Nicolas Sarkozy refuses to answer questions at trial of former aides", "article": "Nicolas Sarkozy has appeared in court as the first former French president to be ordered to testify as a witness \u2013 but refused point blank to answer any questions. \u201cIt is an essential principle of democracies known as the separation of powers, and as president of the Republic I do not have to account for the organisation of my office or the way in which I exercised my mandate,\u201d he told the court in Paris on Tuesday. France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012 told the court that the order, which the judge said was necessary \u201cto determine the truth\u201d since Sarkozy had probably \u201cinfluenced the acts of which the defendants are accused\u201d, was \u201centirely anti-constitutional\u201d. Sarkozy said he was accountable \u201cto the French people, not to a court\u201d. He has not been charged or interrogated in the case, in which five of his former aides and allies are accused of misusing public funds on polling contracts. The former head of state had said earlier he would refuse to testify in the trial, but told the court he had reconsidered because he \u201crespected and have always respected\u201d the judicial system, even if he considered the order to testify \u201ctotally disproportionate\u201d. Sarkozy then exercised his right not to answer a lengthy series of questions from the judge and a lawyer for Anticor, the anti-corruption association that brought the case. Both the public prosecutor and the defence team declined to ask him anything. Five aides and allies of Sarkozy, including his former chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and ex-adviser and consultant Patrick Buisson, have been on trial since 18 October accused of favouritism, conspiracy and misuse of public funds. Prosecutors say the polling contracts, worth \u20ac7.5m (\u00a36.4m), signed by the five during Sarkozy\u2019s term in office were negotiated in secret and without competition, breaking French laws on transparency and competitive bidding in public contracts. Sarkozy, 66, no longer has immunity from legal prosecution and is embroiled in several cases. In September, a judge handed him a one-year prison sentence over the illegal financing of his failed 2012 re-election bid. In March, he was convicted of \u201ccorruption and influence peddling\u201d and given a three-year prison sentence, two years suspended, for trying to bribe a senior judge in one of several legal cases involving him. He is appealing against both verdicts. In October last year, he was placed under formal investigation on an accusation of \u201ccriminal association\u201d over allegations the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi helped finance his successful 2007 presidential campaign to the tune of up to \u20ac50m. He has denied the allegations.

{"title": "Narnia by air: a flying lesson with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "article": "Just before lift-off, I\u2019m asked if I\u2019ve ever done anything like this before. Following a nervous shake of my head, the news is broken that it \u201cmight feel quite unnatural\u201d, but that we would be taking it slow. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d aerial director Gwen Hales asks. Soon I can feel empty space beneath my feet. Even though I am not afraid of heights, I\u2019m suddenly very aware that I am dangling mid-air. This flying lesson feels more secure than I\u2019d imagined but my heart still starts to beat faster. \u201cA lot of people do have a very physical reaction, a bit like a panic attack, when they are taken up,\u201d says Hales. We are at the rehearsal studios for an adaptation of CS Lewis\u2019s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which has just started a tour of the UK. The show was first staged at Leeds Playhouse in 2017 and transferred to the Bridge theatre in London in 2019. Hales was originally a circus performer: for 20 years she specialised as an aerialist, and then began directing when her body \u201cstarted to crumble\u201d. I\u2019m attached to a harness that is tightened around my hips, that works by being clipped on to two metal wires connected to an electrical system. The instructions given are to let the machinery take me into the air. \u201cTry not to fight it,\u201d Hales says. But even with the mechanics pulling me upwards, my immediate reaction is to resist and stay on the ground.\nTo fly, you need strong core muscles. \u201cAnyone can be lifted, but doing choreography needs physical strength,\u201d explains Hales. Before rehearsals start, she sends actors a training plan, mainly involving exercises such as planks. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t done them, you can really tell,\u201d she says. And my own lack of preparation makes following some of her directions difficult \u2013 such as lying flat. When performing aerially, the ability to stay horizontal is vital. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of people flying upright, so we have to do a lot of work to get it right,\u201d says Hales. From a standing position, she instructs me to tip myself so I\u2019m downwards facing. I\u2019m told to stretch out my arms and balance myself while working hard to remain level. \u201cYou won\u2019t fall out of the harness,\u201d she says. But, as I wobble and slip just a little bit too far forward, I can\u2019t help but worry. For Robyn Sinclair, the actor playing Susan, it is her first time properly flying on stage. Though she describes the feeling as a \u201cfizzy excitement\u201d, she tells me she initially felt nervous when she was lifted high up. \u201cIt was frightening. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a natural. It takes me a long time to get used to being at a particular height. But once you do, it is a very powerful feeling.\u201d As Susan, Sinclair only flies once in the show, in a scene when Aslan takes her and her sister Lucy on a journey through the skies of Narnia, but it is a moment she looks forward to performing. \u201cI\u2019m playing a human character, so luckily, I get to act shocked, which makes it easier!\u201d\nFlying is one of the tools used in this production to evoke the Narnia universe, in addition to puppetry and live music. The tour is directed by Michael Fentiman, based on the original production by Sally Cookson, with set and costumes designed by Rae Smith. Fantasy is the reason we return to the tale again and again, says Samantha Womack, the former EastEnders actor who is playing the White Witch. \u201cThe narrative makes your imagination soar,\u201d she says. \u201cEven as adults, people need to experience magic.\u201d Womack argues that Lewis\u2019s story has taken on an even greater relevance during the pandemic. \u201cThe last year has been heavy. People have lost their sense of self and have struggled to understand what it means to have their freedom taken away,\u201d she says. \u201cThis story is all about what matters [in life]. It\u2019s a good time to escape the real world for a bit \u2013 and the flying adds excitement.\u201d My time in the air was, unexpectedly, very moving. Hales tells me this feeling is something she hopes the audience will share. \u201cI like to believe we\u2019re physically connected to the people we watch on stage, so when we see them lifted, our bodies understand the sensation.\u201d Theatrical flight demands that we suspend our belief in reality for a while, and, as I\u2019m lowered on to the ground for the final time, I\u2019m reluctant to say goodbye to my spell in the sky. \u201cHow did it feel?\u201d Hales asks. \u201cSuperhuman,\u201d I reply.

All good things must come to an end, though, and on Tuesday he was named as the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Presumably the 52-year-old Spaniard Italian is an ardent believer in the rule of three, or has come to the conclusion that his next championship will be more satisfying in pure narrative terms if the main character suffers a setback and has to overcome severe difficulties along the way. Either way, it\u2019s a clean snap. But does this reduce Spurs to little more than the status of a MacGuffin? Not sure. Erm. Maybe. Perhaps. Surely not, though.

{"title": "What do we Spurs fans want now? A change in the club\u2019s culture | Martin Cloake", "article": "When the chant of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d rang around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last Saturday as the subs\u2019 board signalled for Lucas Moura to leave the pitch in favour of Steven Bergwijn, it was one of those defining moments football serves up. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was doomed from that moment, but the ire of fans was not simply a product of discontent with a manager\u2019s decision. The chairman, Daniel Levy, is reported to have been furious after the game. As a Spurs fan, he had every right to be. But was the fury also based on the chants of \u201cWe want Levy out\u201d that followed the opprobrium directed at Nuno?\nWhatever prompted the decision to sack the 14th manager of Enic\u2019s reign as owner, the club\u2019s board are firmly in the spotlight. Nuno lasted 17 games, an appointment made after a bungled and highly public flick through a Rolodex of managerial names that filled no one \u2013 probably not even Nuno \u2013 with confidence. It was an appointment that had to be got right, made after the failure of the last appointment that had to be got right. And has led to another appointment that has to be got right. There is open discussion now about whether the board are able to recognise the mistakes made or know how to put them right. But in the absence of any takers, this is the board we have. So we need them to get it right. Our role as a Supporters\u2019 Trust is to help ensure the club achieves the best it can and we have to work with what we have to do that. We\u2019ve been criticised by a small section of fans for not organising protests, but we exist to find solutions, not just take an oppositionist stance to please the gallery. Last Saturday\u2019s expression of anger was all the more powerful for being spontaneous and unorganised. Fans don\u2019t need to be told what to think or given permission to protest. But they would like to know the answers to the questions we\u2019ve put to the board regularly over the past two years and that we set out again last month. None of those questions are unreasonable, none differ from the type that would be asked of any board or business in similar circumstances. Bland and evasive answers about focusing on success and being a family don\u2019t cut it, especially when the club posts a statement urging everyone to stick together one day and sacks the manager the next.\nAntonio Conte needs to be able to assert some leadership, create some direction and identity, and be backed. There\u2019s an air around Spurs that suggests everyone is looking over their shoulder, afraid to make a mistake, focused only on avoiding blame. Anyone who has worked in that kind of environment knows how destructive that is. The need for a change in organisational culture is the most pressing challenge. Without it, we\u2019ll be back discussing another new appointment within 18 months. Fans are often criticised for wanting too much, for not understanding what the great geniuses who run our game understand. But fans just want to be proud of their club, to know that even if the team don\u2019t succeed they will have given it a good go, to have an identity and some hope, above all to be entertained. And they know the difference between price and value.\nSpurs had another glimpse of all that not so long ago, after a sustained period of drift. That shows it can be done.

{"title": "Dead & Beautiful review \u2013 slick vampire drama gets its fangs into the super-rich", "article": "Black Mirror meets Succession in this arthouse-y psychological vampire drama, the story of five super-rich millennials \u2013 the bored, entitled offspring of global billionaires \u2013 who become vampires. The satirical dig here, of course, is that they\u2019re already soulless, uncaring bloodsuckers, even before waking up with actual fangs. But director David Verbeek\u2019s script doesn\u2019t quite wield the scalpel with enough sadistic glee. Instead, this film feels ever-so-slightly sluggish and dour in places. What Verbeek does brilliantly is to create an eerie parallel world of sterile luxury: glass-walled, penthouse restaurants and gleaming, first-class lounges. The film was shot in the Taiwanese capital Taipei, where the five old friends have jetted in. Money can buy whatever they want; but what this lot craves is new experiences. So they have formed an elite club, staging elaborate events and pranks for each other. For his turn Bin-Ray (Philip Juan) fakes his own death. Next up is vacuous Instagram influencer Anastasia (Anna Marchenko). She arranges a spiritual cleansing trip for the group in the mountains that goes spectacularly wrong: the five pass out after a tribal shaman rubs blood into their foreheads. Flying back to the city on a chopper, they discover that they\u2019ve suddenly grown vampire fangs \u2013 there\u2019s a terrific scene of them fiddling with their choppers like six-year-olds with wobbly teeth. Back in Taipei they try to work out whether they are vampires for real: daylight isn\u2019t harmful, but drinking blood (procured from a male stripper) pumps up Alex (Yen Tsao).\nThe film trundles on middlingly until a few late twists: mildly satisfying, they feel a bit muddled and create some serious plot inconsistencies. And the whole thing hinges on a fantasy that, deep down, the fabulously wealthy \u2013 some of them, at least \u2013 despise their money and status. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying it. \u2022 Dead & Beautiful is released on 4 November on Shudder.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/02/dead-beautiful-review-slick-vampire-drama-gets-its-fangs-into-the-super-rich", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:46:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Off le scale: French-baiting and fish puns show Brexit has reignited old rivalry", "article": "The UK\u2019s age-old \u201cfrenemy\u201d relationship with France never fails to ignite passion, and no more so than when the frequent fishing wars are thrown into the mix. Post-Brexit, there is undoubtedly added piquancy to the cross-Channel insults. \u201cAfter le showdown, now it\u2019s LE SURRENDER\u201d, trumpeted the Daily Mail, after France retreated from threats to clog up exports and ban UK fishers from landing catches on its coast in the latest row over licences. Other tabloid headlines evoked similar sentiment \u2013 \u201cLe Surrender\u201d (Metro); \u201cLe Climbdown\u201d (Express). From the hundred years war of the late middle ages through to the 19th-century Napoleonic wars, beyond the signing of the entente cordiale in 1904 and to the present fishing dispute, the UK\u2019s relationship with France has had its rocky moments. The most recent \u201cfishing wars\u201d have provided an excuse for metaphors, and columns revisiting the Allies\u2019 second world war liberation of France, to be dusted down and re-employed as they always are in Britain\u2019s spats with its near neighbour \u2013 with French-baiting Franglais an irresistible element. \u201cClambusters\u201d, railed he Sun, neatly melding the second world war and seafood, after Jean Castex, the French prime minister, wrote to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, last week saying the UK should be shown it caused more harm to leave the EU than to remain. More conflict imagery was dispensed by Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, France\u2019s Europe minister, after the Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan was seized in Le Havre. \u201cNow we need to speak the language of force,\u201d Beaune told French television. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s the only language the British government understands.\u201d The impounding of the British vessel was a dream for headline writers. \u201cDone like a S-kipper,\u201d said the Sun. \u201cShip\u2019s hit fan,\u201d shouted the Daily Star. \u201cGo on Macron, blow up that boat and shock us out of our shellfish behaviour,\u201d ran one Sunday Times article. Others urged the EU to \u201cTell Macron to sling his hook\u201d and to \u201creel in maverick Macron\u201d. Boris Johnson, who greeted France\u2019s fury over a new AUKUS military pact between the UK, US and Australia with the Franglais \u201cdonnez-moi un break\u201d, has also been unable to resist the odd pun. \u201cWe have bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said, in a lame joke ahead of meeting the French president at the recent G20 and ongoing Cop26. Fish puns were much in evidence as recently as May. \u201cFish and ships: UK flexes its mussels,\u201d is how the Sun reported Johnson\u2019s deployment of gunboat diplomacy by dispatching two Royal Navy patrol vessels to Jersey after French trawlers threatened to blockade the port of St Helier. This dispute is the latest in a long line with France over fishing, including the Great Scallop War, or guerre de la coquille, which in October 2012 led to a confrontation between French and British vessels off Le Havre over a difference in fishing restrictions. A second Scallop War in 2018 involved fishing boats colliding and projectiles being hurled. For now, though, France has de-escalated.

The show, originally staged in 2019, has been rewritten to include developments from the intervening years, during which Doyle has become a regular on GB News. The show takes aim at predictable targets: Greta Thunberg, trans athletes, Meghan Markle and Nish Kumar. Tonight, we\u2019re part of an educational seminar. \u201cIf you\u2019re unsure which opinions to have, this is the workshop for you,\u201d McGrath tells us. Doyle says he created the character as a way to challenge the erosion of free speech and the degradation of political debate. There are deep wells of potential material \u2013 the censorious Twitter culture found on both left and right, the tendencies to wilfully misread social media posts and double-down rather than admit mistakes. McGrath only skims the surface. Doyle himself performing standup as the support act engages with his chosen topics more successfully and provides bigger laughs. Barely a minute into McGrath\u2019s section, the show attempts to provoke with a \u201cjoke\u201d using outdated ableist terms. Is the punchline McGrath\u2019s faux pas or are we supposed to find the idea that you\u2019d avoid these phrases amusing? What are we laughing at? It\u2019s a question raised again when a photograph of a trans athlete is presented as a punchline, and when we\u2019re invited to mock McGrath\u2019s defence of Shamima Begum. It\u2019s not always clear whom the character is parodying \u2013 does a wealthy slam poet dressed in Zara-style office-wear conjure the grains of truth that make great satire? The recurring joke is that she\u2019s a hypocrite (a supporting character even spells this out in case we missed the message), but it quickly feels repetitive.\nSome jokes \u2013 on remainers patronising working-class people and the tweeness of anti-Trump protests \u2013 do land. But many do exactly what the show accuses online activists of, reducing complex topics to nuance-free quips. There\u2019s a surprising number of Hitler jokes too, Godwin\u2019s law IRL. In these ways, it does bring Twitter to the West End. I hesitate to give this one star. A show that skewers the terminally offended will no doubt wear it as a recommendation. And yet, here we are.

{"title": "Let them eat space! Elon Musk and the race to end world hunger | Arwa Mahdawi", "article": "Elon Musk has six children and four companies. He is trying to put chips into our brains, build self-driving cars, save the world from an artificial intelligence apocalypse, and colonise Mars. In short, the guy has a lot going on. One would think he would barely have time to eat, let alone tweet \u2013 and, indeed, Musk has claimed that he is in meetings most of the day and the time he spends on Twitter is \u201clike, almost nothing\u201d. Still, the casual observer would be forgiven for thinking that the billionaire lives on Twitter. Musk seems to make headlines every other day because of his inane online activity, which largely consists of cracking juvenile jokes (including a recent sexist gag about T.I.T.S), opining on cryptocurrencies, and getting into online spats. Musk\u2019s latest Twitter beef is with David Beasley, the director of the World Food Programme (WFP). Beasley\u2019s crime was this: he suggested that Musk, who recently became the richest person in the history of the universe and the first person ever to be worth more than $300bn, might help the hungry. According to the WFP, 42 million people are on the brink of famine due to a combination of the climate crisis, structural poverty, conflict and the pandemic. In a recent interview with CNN, Beasley called on the 1% to \u201cstep up now, on a one-time basis\u201d to give $6bn, which is just 0.36% the total increase in net worth of the world\u2019s top 400 billionaires last year. Beasley then name-checked Jeff Bezos and Musk, pointing out that the latter saw a $6bn increase in his net worth in just one day last week. Asking obscenely rich people to help prevent imminent catastrophic famine seems reasonable enough to me. Musk, however, was very prickly about being asked to chip in. \u201cIf WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday. (This, by the way, was appended to a snarky tweet from one of his acolytes asking why the WFP hadn\u2019t solved world hunger already, seeing as it raised $8.4bn in 2020.) Musk added that he would only pony up the money if the WFP used \u201copen source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent\u201d. The not-so-subtle subtext here was: I would obviously help end world hunger, but I can\u2019t trust the WFP.\nMusk\u2019s excuse for not handing over a tiny portion of his wealth to the WFP is hardly original. Billionaires love to sorrowfully declare that they are dying to pay more tax, but they can\u2019t bear to see their money used inefficiently, so, for everyone\u2019s sake, they had better hoard it instead. Last week, in response to a (very short-lived) plan by the Democrats to tax billionaires, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he would happily part with more of his dosh if there were assurances it would be spent well. \u201cIf we could find solutions where the money could be directed in a proper way, I have more to give.\u201d Fellow billionaire Ray Dalio also said he would willingly pay more tax if it accomplished \u201cgreater productivity\u201d but sadly, he wasn\u2019t sure that it did. Musk, meanwhile, insinuated that he was doing us all a favour by not paying more tax. \u201cMy plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness,\u201d he tweeted last Thursday. A couple of days later he darkly warned that a billionaire tax would trickle down. \u201cEventually they run out of other people\u2019s money, and then they come for you.\u201d The government, of course, has already come for the majority of us. The median American household paid about 14% in federal taxes in recent years (that doesn\u2019t include state taxes). Billionaires pay only a tiny fraction of that. ProPublica has calculated that Musk\u2019s \u201ctrue tax rate\u201d is a minuscule 3.27%. But that\u2019s OK; he is working overtime to \u201cpreserve the light of consciousness\u201d.

{"title": "Nicola Sturgeon makes presence felt despite no seat at Cop26 table", "article": "As world leaders, negotiators and activists converged on Glasgow for the start of the Cop climate summit, curious delegates who picked up a Scottish newspaper may have seen a small advert from the Scottish National party. Its main image was of Skye\u2019s famous crags bathed by sunshine, with a soft-focus portrait of the first minister, and it read: \u201cA nation in waiting welcomes the nations of the world.\u201d Despite the simplicity of that proposition, public enthusiasm for independence has fallen since it reached a record high of 59% at the peak of the pandemic in October last year. Most opinion polls over the past six months have shown the yes vote trailing no by between four and eight points.\nWas that message misplaced? Her pro-UK opponents have accused Sturgeon of pursuing a \u201cdivisive obsession\u201d as the rest of the world focused on a collective effort to combat a global crisis \u2013 a charge she denies. Hardliners inside the independence movement fear Sturgeon has lost her spark, fatigued by the long hours she invested managing the Covid crisis, the impacts of Brexit and the Alex Salmond crisis, and running her government. Last week she broached the issue of life after politics, disclosing to Vogue magazine she may foster children in the future. Some internal critics, bolstered by their allies in Salmond\u2019s small breakaway party Alba, are openly challenging Sturgeon on the timing of a referendum, and question her appetite for staging one. Angus MacNeil, a dissident SNP MP who chairs the Commons trade committee, implied in a newspaper column last week that Sturgeon knew Boris Johnson would never agree to a referendum and that the supreme court would block any attempt by her to stage one without his approval. She had to find another route to secure independence, he argued. Yet there are few concrete signs Sturgeon is as ambivalent as her critics allege. When she set out her programme for government in September, she said civil servants had been told to start drafting a new case for independence. Conscious, too, of the public mood, Sturgeon insists that combating Covid takes immediate precedence over pushing for a fresh independence vote. And her strategists have their eyes on other factors, the Cop climate talks among them. What Cop may do is nudge cautious Scottish voters into taking a more green- and climate-minded worldview. If so, that could work to Sturgeon\u2019s long-term advantage and that of the wider independence movement. Her SNP government is sharing power for the first time in 14 years with the pro-independence Scottish Greens. For the first time since devolution in 1999, there are Green ministers at Holyrood and their agreement includes staging an independence vote before the next Scottish election.\nGlasgow\u2019s designation as host city \u2013 perhaps chosen by Conservative ministers in London to show the UK embracing Scotland \u2013 directly influenced Sturgeon\u2019s decision to sign the deal with the Greens. It was a political decision, and not based on numerical advantage at Holyrood: she has aligned the SNP with a more leftwing party to amplify her government\u2019s pro-climate claims, at a time when green politics, thanks to Cop, is ascendant. While Sturgeon does not have a seat at the negotiating table \u2013 no devolved administrations do at Cop \u2013 she is enjoying a significant profile at the conference locally, welcoming Greta Thunberg and the Minga Ind\u00edgena collective, and campaigning for the voices of women and girls to be advanced in the talks. She is sufficiently distant from any policy failures at Cop not to be tainted by them, while able to point to the differences she says independence would bring. That strategy is likely to emerge clearly later in November, when the SNP is to hold a short party conference at which Sturgeon is expected to prioritise the drive for a second independence vote. Any policy failures at Cop and her government\u2019s heavier emphasis on the climate and environment will feature heavily. If Cop helps shift the Scottish electorate\u2019s mood, and finally makes voters amenable to the tougher changes to their energy use, and driving, shopping and holiday habits that cutting CO2 emissions involves, Sturgeon has gambled that the SNP and the case for independence will gain.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/nicola-sturgeon-presence-felt-despite-no-seat-at-cop26-table", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:50:17Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Civilian casualties grow as battle for Yemeni city intensifies", "article": "More than 100 civilians in the Yemeni province of Marib have been killed or injured in the past month as fighting rages for the country\u2019s last major government-loyal stronghold. Marib city has been under sustained attack since the beginning of the year from Houthi rebels, whose forces have steadily closed in on the central desert area on three different fronts. The fight for control of the oil-rich region has become one of the bloodiest and most important battles of Yemen\u2019s seven-year-old civil war. If the rebels succeed in taking Marib they will effectively have beaten the Yemeni government and Saudi-backed coalition, which has managed to cling on to the city with the use of intensive airstrikes. On Sunday, at least 29 civilians were killed in a rebel missile strike which hit a mosque and religious school to the south of Marib city. The unverified death toll for all sides is now believed to run into the tens of thousands. \u201cThe situation has become very bad. It\u2019s not just the fighting, it\u2019s the economic collapse too,\u201d said Hamas al-Muslimi, a 23-year-old student living in Marib but originally from Dhamar.\n\u201cWe used to be able to buy five pieces of bread for 100 rials [\u00a30.30], but now we can only buy two.\u201d For several years, Marib\u2019s relative quiet and prosperity made it a beacon for more than 1 million Yemenis fleeing fighting in other parts of the country, like Muslimi and her family. Many live in vast displacement camps with no water or health facilities and no schools, and have been cut off from the little aid they do receive by Houthi advances over the last two months. According to aid agencies, about 10,000 people have been displaced in October alone, in what amounts to the biggest wave of displacement recorded in a single month this year. \u201cOur staff can reach only a small portion of those in need in Marib, and what we provide is just a drop in the ocean compared to the staggering needs,\u201d Erin Hutchinson, the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s country director for Yemen, said in a statement. \u201cWe call on all parties to spare civilians and ensure that we can keep reaching them with life-saving aid. We also call on the international community to provide the promised funding to keep Yemenis alive in this hour of need.\u201d Yemen\u2019s war between the Iranian-backed Houthi movement and forces loyal to the exiled Yemeni government broke out in 2014 but deteriorated sharply after the intervention of a Saudi-led coalition the following year. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have imposed strict religious edicts on the people living under their control, while the coalition has been widely criticised for bombing civilian infrastructure. The conflict has since spawned the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 70% of the population of 30 million in need of aid to survive. About half are food insecure, with 5 million already starving in pockets of famine-like conditions. Prior to the Houthi offensive on Marib, the war had largely deteriorated into a stalemate. Extensive UN-brokered talks in April and May to discuss a ceasefire for both Marib and the wider country stalled after the Houthis rejected a deal. Diplomatic observers fear that the rebel leadership has since decided that escalating efforts to capture Marib will transform the bargaining calculus. The UK, which is the current penholder for Yemen at the UN security council, has licensed an estimated \u00a320bn in arms exports to member states of the coalition since the conflict began. Earlier this year, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office slashed the UK aid budget for Yemen by 60%.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/civilian-casualties-grow-as-battle-for-yemeni-city-intensifies-marib", "last_update": "2021-11-03T09:41:52Z", "source": "Guardian"},

For opponents it will be \u201cecological vandalism\u201d that spoils the landscape, an artwork that would not look out of place in communist-era eastern Europe. On Tuesday, a government planning inspector came down in favour of the sculpture, overturning a 2019 decision by Northumberland county council to refuse planning permission. It means the the scheme\u2019s backers can go ahead with plans to install the work, nearly three times higher than Antony Gormley\u2019s Angel of the North, on Cold Law, a small hill near Kirkwhelpington. The Elizabeth landmark, which will come with a walking trail, is called Ascendant. It has been designed by the artist Simon Hitchens and is intended as a tribute to the Queen in her platinum jubilee year. Made from steel, the work is meant to look like a thin slice of the hillside, which has been cut north to south through the bedrock and then tilted and elevated.\nMary Ann Rogers, a local artist and gallery owner, said she thought it looked outdated, like something from behind the iron curtain. She is a co-founder of the campaign group Keep the Wannies Wild, which, with 2,000 supporters, has been fighting the plan. \u201cI am absolutely devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI live only a couple of miles away from the site and it is a really special place. It\u2019s somewhere I go to walk and be quiet and listen to the birds so I am absolutely gutted that they are going to do something so mad there.\u201d Rogers said she was a fan of public art but there was no good reason for the sculpture. Nor was it appealing. \u201cTo me it is strident, it\u2019s triumphant and it is vast. It looks more like a scimitar or a knife or a sword.\u201d It was, she said, \u201cecological vandalism\u201d and there was \u201cmonumental irony\u201d that the decision was being announced during the Cop26 summit. The landowner and driving force behind Ascendant is the 3rd Viscount Devonport, Terence Kearley, who has been adamant that the development will have a minimal effect on the natural environment. He was, he said, delighted by the decision. \u201cIt is our ambition to create a sculpture that is not only celebratory of Queen Elizabeth II and the Commonwealth, but which is also a magnificent piece of artwork that acts as a beacon for visitors and tourists to the region \u2013 benefiting the local rural economy and businesses.\u201d The task now is to raise the estimated \u00a32-3m for the project, with campaigners conceding the battle is lost. Hitchens said his sculpture\u2019s design \u201cacknowledges the past, respects the present and aspires for a better future. \u201cI believe the landmark will be a valuable asset to local communities and the north-east of England, as a cultural destination with a global reputation.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/ascendant-embattled-queen-elizabeth-tribute-go-ahead-northumberland", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:10:23Z", "source": "Guardian"},

According to Biden, the coin included insignia of the 261st Signal Brigade unit in the Delaware army national guard, in which his late son, Beau Biden, served as a captain. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta give it to Joe Biden, because it took everything in his power as an old man to not make that coin appear behind the pope\u2019s ear,\u201d joked Noah. \u201cAlso, the fact that he said \u2018God love ya\u2019 to the pope \u2013 that is the most unnecessary \u2018God love ya\u2019 in history,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say \u2018God love ya\u2019 to the pope, he knows God loves him!

I mean, forget the Vatican, these two should\u2019ve been meeting in a sauna.\u201d Seth Meyers\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers highlighted a trove of documents from the Trump White House detailing the events of 6 January that the former president is trying to keep hidden from the investigating House committee In a court filing on Saturday, the National Archives released a list of over 700 pages of documents from call logs to handwritten notes and schedules during and around the riot on 6 January that stormed the Capitol. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m shocked the Trump White House even had any records at all,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cI assumed that place was like a RadioShack in a zombie movie. Most of the call logs probably say \u2018some guy called \u2013 sounded French\u2019 or \u2018Rudy Giuliani butt dial\u2019 over and over again. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an obvious reason Trump wants to keep those records hidden,\u201d he continued. \u201cTrump and cronies had a detailed plan for overturning election results, and they tried to execute that plan, and they almost succeeded. It wasn\u2019t an impulse or a whim; it was a plot.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel\nAnd in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked Donald Trump for attending a World Series game in Atlanta despite repeated distancing of team ownership. Major League Baseball denied making an invitation to Trump and said in a statement: \u201cHe requested to attend the game.\u201d The former president and the Atlanta Braves have a one-sided, tumultuous history. Just months ago, when Major League Baseball pulled the All-Star game from Atlanta over Georgia\u2019s new law restricting voting rights, Trump called on his followers to \u201cboycott baseball\u201d. \u201cThat was in April of this year. Six months later, he\u2019s guzzling Diet Coke and doing the \u2018Tomahawk chop\u2019 at a Braves game in Atlanta,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThe only exercise he gets is if it\u2019s something racist. \u201cPeople were wondering if he would do the \u2018Tomahawk chop,\u2019\u201d Kimmel added of the gameday tradition dance which has come under scrutiny for racist appropriation from Native Americans. \u201cOf course he would do the Tomahawk chop! I give him two days before he starts telling people he invented the Tomahawk chop. \u201cTrump has a lot of resentment toward Native Americans because they know how to run successful casinos,\u201d he quipped. Saturday\u2019s game also marked Melania Trump\u2019s first public appearance since July, and she did not seem enthused. While being introduced by an announcer with her husband, the former First Lady appeared to grimace. \u201cIf we could somehow harness the energy of Melania\u2019s hatred for Donald Trump, we could power the world,\u201d joked Kimmel.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/02/stephen-colbert-late-show-g20-joe-biden-pope", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:27:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Yahoo withdraws from China as Beijing\u2019s grip on tech firms tightens", "article": "Yahoo has announced its withdrawal from the Chinese market in the latest retreat by foreign technology firms responding to Beijing\u2019s tightening control over the industry. \u201cIn recognition of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo\u2019s suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China as of November 1,\u201d the company said on Tuesday. The timing of the pullout coincided with the implementation of China\u2019s new data protection law, which came into effect on Monday. The legislation, which was years in the making, was likened by some to the Chinese equivalent to the stringent GDPR in Europe.\nThe law limits the conditions under which companies can gather personal information and sets rules for how it is used. Chinese laws also stipulate that companies operating in the country must hand over data if requested by authorities, making it difficult for international firms to operate in China as they may face pressure at home over giving in to Beijing\u2019s demands. In the run-up to the implementation of the new legislation, foreign tech companies have been informing their users of the changes in their services in recent months. Yahoo\u2019s withdrawal came less than a month after another US tech company, Microsoft\u2019s professional networking platform LinkedIn, announced it was shutting down operations in China.. In public, the company blamed a \u201csignificantly more challenging operating environment\u201d as well as \u201cgreater compliance requirements in China\u201d. On Tuesday, Yahoo users in mainland China were told the company\u2019s services would no longer be accessible. The products affected included Aol.com and news outlets such as TechCrunch. Users of apps such as Yahoo Weather were told in October that it would be discontinued this month, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo has had a tumultuous and controversial existence in mainland China. In 2007, the company was criticised by lawmakers in the US after it handed over data on two Chinese dissidents to the the authorities, eventually leading to their imprisonment. In recent years, as regulations toward foreign tech companies hardened and domestic competition grew, Yahoo began to downsize its operations in China. In 2015, it closed its Beijing office. Analysts say Yahoo\u2019s withdrawal from China is largely symbolic as at least some of Yahoo\u2019s services, including its web portal, have already been blocked. China has also blocked other US internet services, such as Facebook and Google. Mainland users who wish to access these websites use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the block.

{"title": "Attacking the woman who accuses you? It's no sweat for Prince Andrew | Marina Hyde", "article": "Before we get into it all, let me begin by saying nothing could ever make me question the immense dignity, sanctity and class of the US legal process. It\u2019s really just the latest jewel in the royal family\u2019s many, many crowns that the 95-year-old Queen\u2019s son is now being represented by the guy also defending Armie Hammer over his whole cannibal-fetish-rape situation. Hammer denies all, but you probably know that. And you certainly know most of the Andrew facts. He is accused in a US civil court by former Jeffrey Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleges that the prince sexually assaulted her at Epstein\u2019s mansion in Manhattan and at other locations in 2001 when she was 17. He denies all the accusations \u2013 and it\u2019s been a long old road to get to even this point. But once Andrew had finally allowed lawyers to serve him the papers relating to this civil case, a certain change of pace was inevitable. I guess we all grow out of our family\u2019s heritage law firms eventually, and want to make our own way in the world of more avant garde legal possibilities. At some point in recent months, the prince seems to have decided that the people who deal with the Queen\u2019s dog licences and estates exemptions and so on aren\u2019t the kind of hip-and-hardcore legal eagles more suited to his specific needs and aspirations. We all want to be our own person, you know? Even if that person is \u201c61-year-old former chum of a known paedo whose mum is paying his legal bills\u201d. The chum\u2019s legal bills, not the paedo\u2019s. Prince Andrew is simply accused of sex offences against a minor \u2013 accusations he has long denied. So there is absolutely no suggestion that at some point Andrew finally tired of being in social seclusion in this deer park or on that grouse moor, and screamed: \u201cJust get me what Armie Hammer\u2019s having!\u201d (Apart from anything else, that kind of order could lead to a quite grotesque misunderstanding.) But the fact is, HRH is now being represented by Hollywood power attorney Andrew Brettler. And the gloves are suddenly well and truly off. How else to explain a new legal filing that teeters on the edge of victim blaming \u2013 and then plummets right into it, rolls around it, wallows deeply in it, and then finishes off by making snow angels in it? Lodged with the US district court in Manhattan last Friday, this 36-page motion begins by saying that Giuffre \u201cmay well\u201d be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Epstein, in which case \u201cnothing can excuse, nor fully capture the abhorrence and gravity of Epstein\u2019s monstrous behavior against Giuffre\u201d. Indeed, Andrew\u2019s lawyers would like to proceed \u201cwithout diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein\u2019s alleged misconduct\u201d. Alas, the filing then goes on to: accuse Giuffre of seeking \u201canother payday\u201d at the prince\u2019s expense; claim she has \u201cmilk[ed] the publicity\u201d of her association for years; reference a tabloid newspaper article in which nameless former associates brand her a \u201cmoney-hungry sex kitten\u201d and \u201chead bitch\u201d; break out a whole section supposedly dedicated to \u201cGiuffre\u2019s role in Epstein\u2019s criminal enterprise\u201d; claim she recruited and trafficked young girls for sexual abuse and did so in a way that was \u201cwilful\u201d; suggests her long-running pursuit of justice is diverting judicial time and resources from true victims of abuse; and more \u2013 so much more. Which all feels \u2013 let\u2019s go out on a limb here \u2013 fairly diminishing. Anyone wondering vaguely whether Andrew\u2019s reputation could be damaged any further now has their answer: yes, most definitely. At first glance it might seem bizarre that the guy who inspired such outrage for completely failing to express sympathies for Epstein\u2019s victims during his infamous Newsnight interview should be doubling down on that front. Indeed, that original glaring omission was followed by a friend of his materialising in the newspapers to insist that, while the prince didn\u2019t regret the interview itself, \u201cthe fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein is of course a source of regret\u201d. Is it bollocks. There are two overriding impressions to be gleaned from this latest filing. One, that Prince Andrew has finally decided he\u2019s in the dogfight of his life, and will now say absolutely anything to prevail in it. And two, that his total blindness to the silly little tragedies of Virginia Roberts Giuffre and all the silly little girls like her has lifted not one iota, despite everything that has happened. I don\u2019t know about being biologically incapable of sweating, but on this evidence he certainly seems biologically incapable of having the first or faintest clue.

{"title": "Chinese urged to stockpile amid ongoing Covid outbreak", "article": "Chinese families have been encouraged to stockpile daily necessities, prompting panic-buying, amid surging vegetable prices linked to recent extreme weather, fears of supply shortages and an ongoing Covid outbreak. A notice posted on the website of the Ministry of Commerce late on Monday urged local authorities to stabilise prices and families \u201cto store a certain amount of daily necessities as needed to meet daily life and emergencies\u201d. It prompted some alarm and speculation, including that it related to increasing tensions with Taiwan. Related hashtags were viewed more than 18m times. \u201cAs soon as this news came out, all the old people near me went crazy panic-buying in the supermarket,\u201d wrote one user on Weibo. State media urged calm and Zhu Xiaoliang, a senior commerce ministry official, told the broadcaster CCTV \u201cthe supply of daily necessities is sufficient everywhere\u201d but varying explanations were offered for the notice. Some said the commerce department often releases such warnings in the weeks before national holidays while the People\u2019s Daily said the ministry had issued its instruction earlier this year because of natural disasters, the surge in vegetable prices and recent Covid cases. The Economic Daily, a state-backed newspaper, warned residents against having \u201ctoo much of an overactive imagination\u201d but also said the directive was linked to the outbreak and was to ensure people were prepared in the event of a lockdown. About 500 cases of the Delta variant have been recorded across at least 16 of China\u2019s 31 provinces. Authorities have enacted localised lockdowns, halted movement and travel, and launched mass testing. On Sunday more than 30,000 people were stopped from leaving Shanghai Disneyland until they were all tested, after one case was detected in a woman who might have visited. Despite reassurances, some were still sceptical. A Weibo user commented there had been no warnings to stock up at the outset of the 2020 pandemic. \u201cThis is the first time such a reminder notice has been issued! ! I\u2019m a little scared.\u201d \u201cIt is definitely not a normal reminder,\u201d said another. \u201cReminding us to stockpile will inevitably make the market supply and demand unstable, price fluctuations, and cause panic among some people \u2026 It is very likely to be a special situation.\u201d Extreme weather last month destroyed crops in China\u2019s biggest vegetable growing region, Shandong, threatening this year\u2019s efforts to increase supplies before the lunar new year holiday early next year. Last week, prices of cucumbers, spinach and broccoli had more than doubled from early October. Spinach was more expensive than some cuts of pork at 16.67 yuan ($2.60) per kg, a vegetable price index in Shouguang, a trading hub in Shandong, indicated. Although prices have eased in recent days, economists expect a significant year-on-year increase in consumer price inflation for October, the first in five months. The commerce ministry said local authorities should buy vegetables that could be stored well in advance and also strengthen emergency delivery networks. Information about prices and supply and demand of commodities should be released in a timely manner to stabilise people\u2019s expectations, it added. China also plans to release vegetable reserves \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d to counter rising prices, according to a state TV report on Monday. It is not clear which vegetables China holds in reserves and how big those reserves are.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/chinese-urged-to-stockpile-amid-ongoing-covid-outbreak", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:01:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "BP profits surge amid higher oil and gas prices", "article": "BP has warned that gas markets will remain \u201ctight\u201d during the winter months after rocketing global gas markets fuelled higher-than-expected profits and an extra $1.25bn returns for its shareholders. The global gas supply crisis, which threatens to increase costs for homes and businesses this winter, helped drive BP\u2019s profits to $3.3bn (\u00a32.4bn) for the third quarter, ahead of analysts\u2019 forecasts of $3.1bn. The economic rebound from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic last year has caused global oil and gas prices to surge to record highs in recent months, and lifted BP\u2019s profits more than 38 times higher than a year ago.\nThe FTSE 100 oil company will use its stronger cashflows to buy back an additional $1.25bn of shares, as part of the company\u2019s plans to keep investors on side as it prepares to plough billions of dollars into renewable energy while shrinking its fossil fuel production. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, predicted that gas prices would stay high in the coming months. \u201cAll things being equal, of course that\u2019s a big if, we would expect gas prices to return to normal probably by the summer of next year,\u201d he told the Guardian. Commenting on the oil market, Looney said: \u201cOver the medium term [the oil cartel] Opec is demonstrating strong discipline and importantly the US shale business, which typically would respond strongly in a situation like this, has become very financially disciplined. \u201cDemand is strong but we\u2019re not yet at pre-Covid levels.\u201d He said it was \u201cnot unreasonable to expect prices to remain at this level for some time to come,\u201d adding: \u201cIf oil prices remain strong and it\u2019s very possible that they will, then you can see the sort of financial results that we can generate today.\u201d Prices of wholesale gas have soared because of low storage levels after an especially cold winter in Europe last year and increased energy demand from Asia. The cost of gas for delivery in November hit an all-time high of 407p a therm in early October, though has since fallen back. In December last year it was just 45p. Oil prices have also climbed, and inventories have fallen towards pre-pandemic levels, BP noted. It expects oil prices to be underpinned by a further decline in inventories and possibly additional demand from gas to oil switching. It said that decisions taken on production levels by the Opec+ oil cartel of big producers including Russia continued to be an important factor in oil prices and market rebalancing. Brent crude is now trading at about $85 a barrel. Last week, Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, warned that there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d of oil hitting $100 a barrel. Despite benefiting from higher prices in the third quarter, shares in BP were down 3.5% on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said the results overall were \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. BP expects both oil and gas production in the fourth quarter to be higher than in the third, as it ramps up big projects, particularly in gas regions, and recovers from seasonal maintenance and the impact of Hurricane Ida on production in the Gulf of Mexico. For 2021 as a whole, BP expects production to be lower than 2020 because it is selling off unwanted assets worth $6bn to $7bn as part of its plan to trim the size of its fossil fuel business by 2030. At the same time, BP is investing in renewable energy, buying a pipeline of US solar farms in June, for example. Looney, who is attending a panel at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow on Tuesday night, said about the event: \u201cEverybody wants to see more ambition. We want to see more concrete, realistic actions to drive emissions down. If that means burning gas rather than coal then that\u2019s what we should be doing. I recognise that that is not popular in all camps.\u201d\nNicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said BP\u2019s profits show \u201cthat oil and gas remains a lucrative business\u201d. \u201cHigh prices have driven strong year-on-year growth in profits, and that\u2019s being used to fund a generous $1.25bn share buyback. Coming on top of a $1.4bn buyback announced at the half year stage the group is firmly focused on shareholder returns at present. However, you can reasonably question whether that generosity is justified,\u201d Hyett added. The analyst warned that BP will need to deliver a strong final quarter result to make sure its debt doesn\u2019t begin to rise again. The company is making payments relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 of about $1.5bn before tax this year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/bp-winter-gas-markets-profit-oil-gas-prices-covid", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:58:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Johnson apologises after minister who uses wheelchair denied entry to Cop26 venue", "article": "An Israeli government minister has received an apology from Boris Johnson and the organisers of Cop26 after she could not attend the summit on Monday due to a lack of wheelchair accessibility. Karine Elharrar, Israel\u2019s minister of energy and water resources, described how she was denied entry to the summit because as a wheelchair user she was unable to access the Glasgow venue, criticising the refusal to accommodate her as \u201coutrageous\u201d. Elharrar, who has muscular dystrophy, waited for two hours outside after organisers refused to let her enter the compound in the vehicle in which she had arrived, she said.\nHer office said she was eventually offered a shuttle transport to the summit area, but the shuttle was not wheelchair-accessible, forcing her to return to her hotel in Edinburgh. She wrote on Twitter: \u201cI came to Cop26 to meet with my counterparts around the world and promote a common struggle in the climate crisis. It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, does not provide accessibility to its events.\u201d An official in the Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett\u2019s delegation said they had formally complained to organisers, the Times of Israel reported. Bennett reportedly said Elharrar\u2019s vehicle would arrive at the summit area on Tuesday as part of his official convoy, thus ensuring her entry. Johnson later apologised personally to Elharrar when she joined a meeting between him and Bennett, saying he was sorry for the \u201cconfusion\u201d. Bennett thanked his British counterpart for his \u201cquick intervention on this unfortunate incident\u201d and called it a \u201clearning opportunity for all of us in the importance of accessibility for all\u201d, a statement backed by Johnson. Cop26 organisers tweeted: \u201cRegarding minister Elharrar\u2019s experience at the entry point yesterday, this was a genuine mistake and we have apologised for that. We are pleased to see her in attendance at Cop26 today. Cop26 must be inclusive and accessible to all and the venue is designed to facilitate that.\u201d Elharrar told BBC News she had gone into the climate summit on Tuesday \u201cvery easily\u201d and it was \u201cquite a different experience\u201d. Earlier the UK environment secretary, George Eustice, said: \u201cWe deeply regret that incident.\u201d He added there appeared to have been a miscommunication and organisers had not been aware of Elharrar\u2019s requirements in advance and so had not made the right provisions at the particular entrance she was coming to. \u201cI know that at most of the other entrances, wheelchair access is there. It was because she came to an entrance where they didn\u2019t have that provision,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding that action should have been taken to resolve the issue. A spokesperson from the Israeli embassy in London told BBC News the country\u2019s delegation to the summit had \u201ccommunicated over the past several weeks all the details about the minister\u2019s requirements\u201d. The UK ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan, tweeted that he had apologised \u201cdeeply and sincerely\u201d to the minister. \u201cWe want a Cop summit that is welcoming and inclusive to everyone,\u201d he wrote. The Foreign Office minister James Cleverly tweeted: \u201cI am deeply disappointed and frustrated that minister @KElharrar could not access Cop today. The Cop venue is designed to be accessible for all. I have spoken to the minister about this and I look forward to meeting her tomorrow.\u201d Elharrar told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news: \u201cThe only way they said I could come in was to walk on foot for almost a kilometre, or to board a shuttle which was not wheelchair-accessible.\u201d She told Ynetnews.com that organisers blocked all roads leading to the conference and left her out despite the Israeli delegation\u2019s best efforts to convince security to let her in. \u201cIt was impossible to get in with a car and I could not make that distance independently,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous conduct and it should not have happened. I came for certain purposes and could not achieve them today, but there will be other opportunities. \u201cThe UN calls on everyone to act in accordance with the international convention and to make places accessible, so it is fitting that its events should be accessible. I sincerely hope that today\u2019s lesson will be learned so that tomorrow promoting green energies, removing barriers and energy efficiency will be the only things I have to deal with.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/wheelchair-using-minister-denied-entry-to-cop26-venue", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:40:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Published in 2015, the novel follows the story of trans fourth grader Melissa, who is seen by everyone as a boy named George, but who decides to reveal who she really is by playing the role of Charlotte in her class play, Charlotte\u2019s Web. It won the American novelist, whose pronouns are they and them, literary prizes including the Children\u2019s Stonewall award, the Lambda literary award, and a Children\u2019s Choice book award. But Gino said this summer that it had been a mistake to title the novel George, apologised to the character and to the wider trans community, and began changing the title to Melissa\u2019s Story when signing books for fans.\n\u201cThe title of my book made it seem as though it is OK to use an old name for a person when they have provided you with a different name that works better for them. I want to be clear \u2013 it isn\u2019t,\u201d Gino said at the time. \u201cThe cover is beautiful. Iconic, even. But here\u2019s the thing: so many transgender people have been told that we are beautiful/handsome as a reason not to transition, myself included. We are told that we will mar something special, as though looking pleasant to others is more important than being ourselves. As if it\u2019s not more important than seeing who\u2019s really there, scars and all.\u201d Gino explained that the original title came about because while they were writing the novel, they \u201cjokingly\u201d called it Girl George, playing on the singer Boy George. Scholastic, after acquiring the story, advised taking the word \u201cgirl\u201d off the cover when publishing because \u201cthere would be some people who wouldn\u2019t give the book to a boy if it had the word girl on it\u201d; Gino, \u201cstunned\u201d to be published at all, agreed. \u201cI wish I had realised to speak up then,\u201d they said this summer.\nNow Scholastic and Gino are officially changing the title of the book from George to Melissa \u201cto respect Melissa and all trans people\u201d, said the author. Scholastic, which will publish the new edition from next April in the US, added: \u201cWhat we call people matters and we all deserve to be addressed in ways that feel good to us. Once you see a mistake, you can always change it.\u201d Gino\u2019s UK publisher, Scholastic UK, said it would also be replacing George with Melissa from the next reprint. \u201cNo matter how many people have come to know it as George, we felt it was important to fix the title,\u201d said Gino, urging readers to either make the title change themselves, print out new covers from Scholastic\u2019s website, or buy a new copy once Melissa is published. \u201cThe text inside won\u2019t change, so the name George will still appear to reflect the character\u2019s growth within the novel, but Melissa will be the first name readers will know her by.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/02/alex-gino-childrens-novel-george-retitled-melissa-to-respect-trans-heroine", "last_update": "2021-11-02T13:48:38Z", "source": "Guardian"},

A global transition to green energy and vehicles is vital in tackling the climate crisis, and economies of scale mean that costs plummet as production increases \u2013 as already seen with solar panels and LED lightbulbs. More than 40 nations said they would align standards and coordinate investments to speed up production and bring forward the \u201ctipping point\u201d at which green technologies are more affordable and accessible than fossil-fuelled alternatives. At that point, the green transition and cuts in climate emissions accelerate rapidly towards a net zero economy. Among the countries signed up to the Breakthrough Agenda are the UK, US, China, India, the EU and Australia. The first five breakthroughs will be clean electricity, electric vehicles, green steel, hydrogen and sustainable farming. The aim is to make these affordable and available to all nations by 2030 and create 20m new jobs. \u201cBy making clean technology the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice, the default go-to in what are currently the most polluting sectors, we can cut emissions right around the world,\u201d said Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, which is hosting Cop26.\n\u201cThe Glasgow Breakthroughs will turbocharge this forward, so that by 2030 clean technologies can be enjoyed everywhere, not only reducing emissions but also creating more jobs and greater prosperity,\u201d said Johnson, who launched a \u00a33bn finance package on Monday to support green technology in developing countries. New plans include a global electricity initiative launched by the UK and India and endorsed by 80 nations. The Green Grids Initiative aims to mobilise political will and finance to create international supergrids on all continents and to link up sunny deserts and windy coasts with population centres. By connecting many locations, supergrids are key to providing reliable electricity from renewable energy that may be locally intermittent. Another new initiative is the Global Energy Alliance for People & Planet, which is focused on producing clean electricity across the global south. It has an initial $10bn from the World Bank, Rockefeller Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund and others. UK and Scandinavian pension funds also announced on Tuesday they would invest $130bn in clean energy by 2030. The authors of a report published to support the Breakthrough Agenda concluded: \u201cInternational collaboration can create faster innovations, larger economies of scale, and stronger incentives for investment, to accelerate progress towards tipping points where clean solutions become the most affordable, accessible and attractive options worldwide.\u201d The Breakthrough Agenda follows other voluntary agreements at Cop26 on ending deforestation by 2030 and cutting global emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30%. These commitments have been broadly welcomed, but some delegates warned that global heating would not be reduced unless the plans become reality. Nations at the two-week summit are also tasked with getting funding to poorer and vulnerable countries and finalising the rules of the 2015 Paris agreement. The cost of solar panels, LED bulbs and lithium ion batteries have plunged by about 90% in the past decade, with solar and wind power now the cheapest power in most of the world. By coordinating signals to industry, policies and standards, research efforts and investments, the governments aim to drive production up and prices down for other technologies.\nElectric cars are already cheaper to run than those burning fossil fuels and are close to the tipping point when they become cheaper to buy. Requiring carmakers across big markets to make a certain proportion of new cars electric, for example, could increase this. The nations will coordinate to speed up the growth of markets, but will also compete to supply those markets. A recent study from Oxford University estimated the costs of clean energy technologies such as batteries and hydrogen electrolysers could fall by 45% by 2030 and 75% by 2050 with speedy deployment. The private sector is involved in the Breakthrough Agenda with a \u201cfirst movers coalition\u201d of 25 global companies committing to buy emerging clean technologies in sectors such as steel, trucking, shipping, aviation and concrete. Firms are expected to include the shipping company Maersk and the cement maker Holcim. In farming, coordinated rules for blocking imports of beef, soy, palm and cocoa linked to deforestation could hasten the end of forest destruction. A US-UAE initiative, backed by 30 countries, has gathered $4bn (\u00a32.9bn) for investment in climate-smart agriculture. World leaders have committed to discussing and strengthening global progress on breakthroughs every year, supported by reports led by the International Energy Agency. The Economics of Energy Innovation and System Transition report was produced by experts from the UK, EU, Brazil, China, and India. \u201cThe policies that drove major breakthroughs in low-carbon technologies like wind and solar, were challenged by traditional economic advice, which ignored the role of innovation [in reducing costs] and framed climate policy as costly,\u201d said Prof Michael Grubb, at University College London and a co-author of the report. \u201cWe need to learn from these successes.\u201d Prof Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said last week that most economists had badly underestimated the speed at which the costs of clean technologies fall and failed to take account of the \u201cimmense risks and potential loss of life\u201d that could occur as a result of the climate crisis.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/world-leaders-announce-plan-to-make-green-tech-cheaper-than-alternatives", "last_update": "2021-11-02T14:54:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Trump call to \u2018find\u2019 votes was threat to my safety, Georgia elections official says", "article": "The Georgia Republican responsible for running elections considered an infamous call in which Donald Trump told him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state a \u201cthreat\u201d to his safety and that of his family.\nBiden\u2019s victory in Georgia was a narrow but vital part of his national win. No Democratic presidential candidate had taken the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. Trump called Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, nearly two months after election day, on Saturday 2 January. Telling him \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear we won\u201d, the then president said: \u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have [to get]\u201d to surpass Biden\u2019s total. Raffensperger, a conservative who supported Trump, resisted the president\u2019s demands. That prompted Trump to suggest the refusal to expose mass voter fraud in Georgia \u2013 on which Trump insisted but which did not exist, as in all other states \u2013 could be a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a big risk to you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big risk.\u201d In Integrity Counts, a book published on Tuesday, Raffensperger writes: \u201cI felt then \u2013 and still believe today \u2013 that this was a threat. Others obviously thought so, too, because some of Trump\u2019s more radical followers have responded as if it was their duty to carry out this threat.\u201d Raffensperger details death threats texted to his wife, an encounter with men who may have been staking out his home, and being escorted out of the Georgia state capitol on 6 January as rightwing protesters entered. A recording of Trump\u2019s call was released to the Washington Post and became a key exhibit in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, for inciting the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, by supporters seeking to overturn the election. Trump was acquitted when only seven Republican senators could be persuaded to vote for his guilt. He remains free to run for president again and dominates the Republican party but his attempts to overturn his defeat in Georgia have contributed to his extensive legal jeopardy. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, is investigating. Raffensperger told the Associated Press investigators \u201ctalked to some of our folks here.

{"title": "French officials vent fury over Australian leak of Macron text message", "article": "Elys\u00e9e officials have expressed fury at the decision of Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to leak a private text message from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the diplomatic rift between the two countries deepened. \u201cConfidence has been completely shattered,\u201d a close adviser to Macron told French media on Tuesday. \u201cDisclosing a text message exchange between heads of state or government is a pretty crude and unconventional tactic.\u201d The adviser told Le Parisien that it \u201cwould never even enter the head\u201d of the French president to disclose communications of this kind. \u201cIt is not the kind of thing that is likely to improve relations between France and Australia,\u201d they said.\nIn the text, two days before the announcement of the Aukus security partnership and the cancellation of a major French contract to supply submarines to Australia, Macron asked Morrison whether he could expect good or bad news on the submarines. Its publication came after Macron told reporters he \u201cknew\u201d that Morrison had lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines. Morrison rejected the claim and said he was \u201cnot going to cop sledging of Australia\u201d. French media described the text message leak as \u201cspectacular and extremely rare\u201d, saying it appeared to be aimed at demonstrating that Macron had already been informed the contract might not go ahead even before it was torn up. But the Elys\u00e9e official insisted the text showed rather that Macron \u201cdid not know what stage the discussions had got to\u201d just two days before Australia called off the A$90bn (\u00a349bn) deal for 12 conventionally powered submarines. A second French government source told Agence-France Presse that if a message existed that clearly showed that Macron did in fact know, \u201cthey would have reported that instead\u201d. The source added: \u201cWe knew the Australians had some issues, but they only concerned technical aspects and the timetable, as with every big contract.\u201d It was precisely those issues that the text message referred to, ahead of a discussion with submarine manufacturer Naval Group planned for the following day, the source said. It is not clear what response Morrison gave to the message. The Elys\u00e9e also rejected Canberra\u2019s account that it made multiple attempts to contact Paris to warn of the impending announcement. The official told Le Parisien only one phone call had come through to the palace, at 11am on a Wednesday \u2013 during Macron\u2019s weekly cabinet meeting. \u201cIt is difficult to believe that the Australian prime minister has not been advised of this constraint,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe knew very well the president was unavailable.\u201d It was later that same day, the adviser said, that Paris had learned that the contract was being rescinded and that a press conference was to be held during the afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a curious way of going about things,\u201d the Elys\u00e9e source told Le Parisien. \u201cFrance was left with no opportunity to respond or to come up with a counter-proposition, which we had the means to do. Once again, it is not the choice that we denounce \u2013 that\u2019s a sovereign decision. It\u2019s the way of doing things.\u201d The Elys\u00e9e also said that Morrison could have sought a reconciliatory meeting with Macron in recent days, at the G20 meeting in Rome or the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. \u201cThe president was waiting for a proposition from the prime minister, which did not come,\u201d the source said. Morrison spoke with Macron by phone last week, and the French president used that call to urge the Australian government to propose concrete steps to repair the relationship. Morrison insists that he \u201cmade very clear\u201d to Macron at a dinner in Paris in mid-June \u201cthat a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia\u2019s strategic requirements\u201d. But the Australian prime minister also said he wasn\u2019t at liberty at that stage to disclose to Macron that Australia would work with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, because those plans had not yet been finalised and were held \u201cin confidence\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/french-officials-vent-fury-over-australian-leak-of-macron-text-message", "last_update": "2021-11-02T20:10:37Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Canadian academic on leave amid row over Indigenous ancestry claims", "article": "A Canadian official and academic specialising in Indigenous health issues has been placed on administrative leave from her university after an investigation challenged her claims of Indigenous ancestry. Carrie Bourassa, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, has described herself as having M\u00e9tis, Anishinaabe and Tlingit heritage. In 2019 she appeared at a TEDx talk wearing a blue embroidered shawl and holding a feather, where she identified herself as \u201cMorning Star Bear\u201d. However, an investigation by CBC television alleged that Bourassa was entirely of European descent. She recently stepped down from her role as scientific director for Indigenous peoples health at the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR). Bourassa had been described by the CIHR as \u201ca M\u00e9tis woman, a highly regarded Indigenous researcher\u201d who \u201chas been a selfless leader and a tireless champion for all Indigenous peoples in this country\u201d. The CBC investigation has drawn comparisons with the case of Rachel Dolezal, an American academic and activist who was accused of passing herself off as black. A M\u00e9tis professor who worked with Bourassa told CBC she was \u201cthe modern-day Grey Owl\u201d \u2013 a reference to Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, the British-born conservationist and writer who passed himself off as a Native American in the early 20th century. CBC reported that people who worked with Bourassa had expressed disquiet about her account of her ancestry, and some examined her genealogical records, which reportedly showed that her ancestors were of Russian, Polish and Czechoslovakian descent. In an email to CBC, Bourassa said she had been adopted as M\u00e9tis by a friend of her grandfather and had subsequently been adopted into other communities. She accused the broadcaster of running a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her, adding she was \u201cshocked and dismayed at the recent attack on my identity\u201d. In a statement released by Bourassa after the claims were broadcast she said she identified as M\u00e9tis and that elders who supported her did not rely on \u201cblood quantums\u201d to assess Indigenous identity. In comments reported in the Saskatoon StarPhoenix, she added: \u201cMaybe in the fact that I\u2019m trying so hard to pull pieces together, maybe I\u2019ve forgotten certain things. It\u2019s hard sometimes when you\u2019re so anxious to find some of the gaps you know are there.\u201d The treatment of Indigenous people in Canada has been in the spotlight in recent months after the discovery of unmarked grave sites at residential schools that had attempted to eradicate the culture and languages of Indigenous populations. Among those quoted by CBC was Janet Smylie, a health academic of M\u00e9tis heritage at the University of Toronto, who wrote a chapter in a 2017 book on Indigenous parenting edited by Bourassa. Smylie told the broadcaster she had done her own research into Bourassa\u2019s ancestry. \u201cIt makes you feel a bit sick,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have an impostor who is speaking on behalf of M\u00e9tis and Indigenous people to the country about literally what it means to be M\u00e9tis \u2026 that\u2019s very disturbing and upsetting and harmful.\u201d The university and the health agency initially supported Bourassa, though on Monday the university issued a statement saying it had \u201cserious concerns with the additional information revealed in Dr Bourassa\u2019s responses to the media.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/canadian-academic-on-leave-amid-row-over-indigenous-ancestry-claims", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:50:02Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ending Disease review \u2013 a powerful case for the miracle cure", "article": "Here is a film that tugs at the heartstrings as it painstakingly covers the lives of 10 patients participating in stem cell research trials in the US. From a quadriplegic high-school basketball star to a mother with recurring cancers, the subjects experience remarkable recoveries thanks to this medical revolution. One of the most moving moments is when Ryan, the teenage athlete, returns home four months after his initial treatment and raises his hand to greet his loved ones at the airport, a progress that would have been unimaginable without the advent of stem cell therapy. While the treatment has proved extraordinarily successful in combating incurable diseases, the research remains controversial as it involves the use of human embryos, which is inevitably intertwined with the abortion debate hotly contested in US politics. Furthermore, pharmaceutical corporations are hostile to a medical technology that would significantly reduce the traditional reliance on medications. Indeed, in the case of cancer patients, as stem cells can multiply into healthy cells to repair damaged areas from within, the research aims to reach a point where chemotherapy would no longer be needed. Once banned by George W Bush, federal funding for stem cell studies has gradually increased, though it remains mostly awarded for non-embryonic research.\nThis documentary is an effective emotional appeal, though perhaps it could have begun to examine the scientific side of the research earlier than the halfway point of a two-hour film.

How can I jazz them up? Tessa, Glasgow \u201cI love sausages in any guise, and the simpler, the better,\u201d says Stosie Madi, chef and co-owner of the Parkers Arms in Newton-in-Bowland, Lancashire. \u201cThey are, however, also a wonderful driver for lots of fun dishes.\u201d So how can you get more, er, bang from your banger? If you\u2019re cooking for a crowd this Bonfire Night, Tom Kerridge suggests channelling pigs in blankets: \u201cDust your sausages with a little curry powder, wrap them in bacon, then cook them on the barbecue or in the oven,\u201d says the chef/patron of Michelin-starred The Hand & Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Then tuck them in hot dog buns with smoked cheese and serve with \u201cmayonnaise mixed with German mustard, chopped dill, cornichons and shallots\u201d. For ultimate autumn vibes, Tommy Heaney, chef/patron of Heaneys in Cardiff, braises lentils, onion and bacon, tosses them with roast pumpkin, and serves topped with sausages and salsa verde. Heaney makes the latter with mint, parsley, watercress, capers, gherkins, anchovies and sea salt: \u201cI love pork with mint,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not traditional, but it works really well.\u201d And if you\u2019re lighting a bonfire, \u201cbrown the sausages, onions and pumpkin, put them all in a casserole with some stock and whack it straight on the fire\u201d. Finish with a dollop of the same salsa verde, and it\u2019s job done. Pumpkins are also welcome in a \u201csausage tagine-type thing\u201d, says Madi, who mixes roast squash with ready-cooked chickpeas and spiced couscous. \u201cThe couscous is the carrier of the spice, so add cumin, harissa, a little chilli to give it some heat.\u201d Serve with grilled sausages and garlic-yoghurt for \u201ca lovely centrepiece\u201d. Alternatively, up the ante with something more theatrical: \u201cHollow out a pumpkin, roast the flesh and make an almost-pureed, velvety soup,\u201d she says, then pour into the pumpkin shell. \u201cRoast some sausages, put them on skewers and dip into the soup to add a bit of fun.\u201d While sausages defy the seasons, come autumn, they\u2019re particularly good in pasta, traybakes, cassoulet or, Madi says, simply with spuds: \u201cCut up some grilled sausages, put them on a nice layer of mash, add lots of cheese and grill.\u201d Then there are stews, which, Kerridge says, can easily be made with canned stuff. \u201cRoast sausages in a pan to get loads of colour on them, throw in a drained tin of mixed beans, add a tin of tomato soup, bring to a boil, then reduce and add a good pinch of smoked paprika and some salt and pepper.\u201d Serve with warm crusty bread for mopping. Perhaps the simplest solution, however, is a sausage wrap, which Madi endorses \u201cevery step of the way\u201d. She brushes Lebanese flatbread with oil, adds the skinned sausagemeat, some cheese and/or onion if the mood takes her, folds the bread over, brushes with more oil and bakes at 180C for 12-15 minutes \u2013 \u201cor just enough time to have a big glass of wine\u201d. Dip into sweet chilli sauce-spiked yoghurt or serve with a tin of beans jazzed up with Tabasco. \u201cThrow your shoes off and tuck in: there\u2019s really nothing nicer.\u201d \u2022 Got a culinary dilemma?

{"title": "Modern pentathlon votes to ditch horse riding after Tokyo Olympic turmoil", "article": "It is a sport conceived originally by the founder of the modern Olympics to help cavalry riders to develop the skills needed to survive behind enemy lines. But after 109 years, modern pentathlon\u2019s governing body has voted secretly to remove horse riding and replace it with cycling, the Guardian can reveal. Multiple sources have said the decision was taken by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne\u2019s executive board in recent days, and was hastened by the distressing scenes at the Tokyo Olympics when a horse was punched by a German coach after it refused to jump a fence.\nThose pictures made global headlines and the UIPM is understood to have acted in order to preserve its status in the Olympics in the lead-up to the Paris 2024 Games. While the decision has not yet been announced officially, it is already facing a backlash from some countries who believe that losing the horse-riding element fundamentally changes the sport. Modern pentathlon has been a core Olympic event since 1912 when it was invented by Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 and while it has since moved from a five-day event to a solitary day it has always tested athletes in fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting, and cross-country running. The UIPM refused to deny the story when confronted by the Guardian, with a spokesperson saying: \u201cI am not able to give you any information right now.\u201d However, the organisation later released a statement: \u201cAs part of UIPM\u2019s commitment to maintaining a strong, dynamic profile for modern pentathlon, a series of strategic meetings are being held. These meetings will include an upcoming call with national federations later this week. The outcome of these meetings will be detailed in a press release to be published on 4 November.\u201d The former British modern pentathlete Kate Allenby, who won a bronze for Team GB at the Sydney Olympics, told the Guardian any move to replace riding would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the sport. \u201cThis needs talking about because it\u2019s not modern pentathlon if it hasn\u2019t got riding in it,\u201d she said. However another British Olympian Greg Whyte, who also won a world silver medal in 1994, said he could understand the change. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the day, the fencing part alone used to take 14 hours, while in Paris the whole event will last just 90 minutes. All sports evolve, and no sport is immune from change in the modern TV era.\u201d\nThe UIPM is understood to have acted after the sport was heavily criticised in Tokyo. The German competitor Annika Schleu, who had been in the gold-medal position before the showjumping, was seen in tears after her ride, Saint Boy, refused to jump over the obstacles. The German coach Kim Raisner, who was seen punching Saint Boy, was sent home from Tokyo and the UIPM promised to conduct a full review as well as disciplining Raisner.

So how does the show fare now it\u2019s on its feet? It certainly sends laughter rolling through the aisles, as two middle-aged divorcees \u2013 one nice, one nasty \u2013 embroil themselves in ever more baroque misadventures. But over two hours, the stage play does strain against the podcast conceit, which is that Brian and Roger communicate only via answerphone messages. One craves character development, which never really comes. The plot is circular too, in that it recounts a succession of scrapes into which Roger\u2019s good nature allows Brian to entangle him. It begins small-scale, as the pair arrange to watch their Avatar DVD in Brian\u2019s student digs, then proceeds to outdo itself ever more garishly. Eager-to-please Roger, pining for his family and stony broke, is coerced to take part in a seance in West Ruislip, an Albanian gambling ring in a Wiltshire abattoir, and finally a donkey trek across China disguised as a UN diplomat. All end violently badly for our hapless hero, while false friend Brian makes himself scarce. There\u2019s pleasure to be had here, in Peacock and co-writer Dan Skinner\u2019s ear for the bathos of their characters\u2019 compromised lives, in which a regional manager job at Ask Pizza is the zenith of glamour. In Skinner\u2019s performance, Roger\u2019s pathetic pluck in the face of adversity and his never-quite-strong-enough efforts to resist Brian\u2019s manipulation are beautifully played. They do get repetitive though, just as Brian\u2019s cartoonish selfishness and cynicism give Simon Lipkin (stepping into Peacock\u2019s role) only a couple of dimensions to play with. None of that\u2019s a problem in a comic podcast, but a play needs more. Director David Babani tries to supply it, opening up space around the restricting convention of Brian and Roger\u2019s phone messages with impressive digital backdrops (video design by Timothy Bird). In lieu of character progression, events become increasingly manic and overblown as the play progresses, leaving its most fertile dramatic terrain \u2013 the everyday poignancy of the two divorcees\u2019 lives \u2013 in its wake.

{"title": "The UK must ban \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 \u2013 even for adults who claim to want it | Jayne Ozanne", "article": "Last week the government finally published its proposals on how it intends to ban the degrading practice of so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d. It has taken years of lobbying, several high-profile resignations, as well as various statements from senior religious leaders and indeed whole denominations \u2013 such as the Church of England and the Methodist church \u2013 to get us to this point. Was it worth the wait? In truth there is much in the proposals that can and should be welcomed. The government has shown willing to listen to the senior human rights lawyers behind the Cooper report, which I convened, and has accepted our proposal of a two-pronged approach involving both criminal and civil remedies. This means that as well as clear criminal sanctions against perpetrators, who now face sentence of up to five years and a hefty fine, it will also introduce new protection orders that will work to safeguard young vulnerable LGBT+ people from harm. That is, if you are under 18 or have been found to have been forced or coerced into conversion therapy. But this restriction, focusing purely on the under-18s, is woefully inadequate and leaves thousands still open to abuse, particularly in religious settings \u2013 which the government\u2019s own research has shown accounts for the majority of conversion practices. The new law would still allow adults to freely seek out such therapies. However, we know that it is young adults (aged 18-24) who are vulnerable to significant risk when they leave home and find themselves wooed by fundamentalist religious groups. So why has the government left this major loophole? I think, sadly, it is for the same reason that it has taken so many years to formulate this legislation: it does not want to offend a small minority of rightwing evangelicals within its party who want to be able to continue these barbaric practices of \u201cpraying the gay (and trans) away\u201d. As someone who underwent nearly 20 years of conversion therapy, which resulted in me being hospitalised twice, I find this utterly unforgivable. The current proposals to allow adults to give \u201cinformed consent\u201d would not have protected me, nor indeed the thousands of others like me who willingly undertook conversion therapy because we believed it was the right thing to do. Indeed, everyone we knew believed it was the right thing to do. To not go through it would have meant being ostracised by all those around us whom we loved and respected. I believed my desires to be sinful and was told that they must have arisen as a result of some deep trauma or unhealthy relationship with one of my family members. As a result, I put myself through years of \u201chealing prayer\u201d ministry, sharing some of my most intimate moments and relationships with strangers in the hope that we might \u201cfind the key\u201d as to why I was attracted to women. I was constantly told that my prayers were unanswered because of my lack of faith, or that I obviously was not walking a godly enough path. Part of the trauma of these abusive practices is that you, the victim, are always left with the burden of being told it is your fault that you are not healed. I went on to seek other forms of spiritual counselling, including many exorcisms \u2013 paying thousands of pounds in the process. Years of shame, guilt and loneliness were then added to an increasing belief that God had deserted me. It was a living hell. I am a relatively strong person, and it nearly broke me \u2013 sadly many others are not so lucky, and tragically come to a point of believing that the only way out is to take their lives. That\u2019s why conversion practices need to be banned outright, with no exceptions. That\u2019s also why these rightwing evangelicals need to be held accountable for the trauma they cause. The government has sadly prioritised listening to their voices over those of survivors and has been oblivious to the mounting evidence of the harm that these religious practices inflict. The government needs to think again. First, it must learn from the experiences of survivors and prioritise their concerns, for we are the true experts. We know better than anyone what needs to be banned, and how best to do this. Two short meetings with the ministers for equalities \u2013 the sum total of their direct engagement with survivors \u2013 will never get to the bottom of this; nor will trying to \u201cbalance\u201d our views with those who have caused us such harm, and who want to continue doing so. There is no middle road here: one needs to either protect people from harm or leave the door open to abuse. We cannot have another consultation that seeks to legitimise the concerns of those who are determined to continue with these degrading practices. Second, the government needs to listen to the senior human rights lawyers who have set out in the Cooper report why religious freedoms can and must be limited when significant harm is being caused. It should follow their recommendations on how best to do this: by focusing on practices that have the \u201cpredetermined purpose\u201d of trying to change, \u201ccure\u201d or suppress a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. It must also take on board their arguments about why \u201cinformed consent\u201d for adults cannot be a defence in law when so many people\u2019s health, wellbeing and indeed their very lives are at risk. That is why we do not allow for consent to female genital mutilation or forced marriage, or even such everyday matters as wearing a seatbelt. Finally, it must listen to the religious leaders from around the world who have also come together to ask their governments to ban this abhorrent practice. This will also enable those leaders to work within their organisations to ensure that it is ultimately stamped out. The government cannot afford to get this wrong \u2013 too many lives are quite literally at stake. My hope and prayer is that it will, finally, listen and recognise that outlawing conversion therapy can never have get-out clauses. Anything else is a ban in name only.

{"title": "Jacob Rees-Mogg questions fairness of Owen Paterson suspension vote", "article": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has questioned the fairness of the Conservative MP Owen Paterson facing a six-week suspension from parliament and possible byelection, after he was found to have committed an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules. Rees-Mogg, who is leader of the Commons, raised concerns about the investigation, and expressed sympathy with Paterson\u2019s complaint that 17 witnesses who wanted to speak in his favour were not able to give oral evidence. Ahead of a vote on whether to enforce the suspension recommended by parliament\u2019s standards commissioner and committee, Rees-Mogg kept open the possibility the government could whip Tory MPs to reduce or cut it completely. \u201cIt is always very important that systems appear to be fair, and therefore if somebody has witnesses, it would normally appear to be fair that those witnesses should be heard,\u201d he said on his regular ConservativeHome podcast. He said the standards commissioner \u2013 Kathryn Stone \u2013 could have appointed a senior legal figure to help in the investigation, and added: \u201cMany people have been raising with me recently questions about the process that affected Owen Paterson.\u201d Paterson has tried to dismiss the propriety of the two-year investigation into his business links with Randox and Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, claiming it was not compliant with natural justice because he was acting as a whistleblower and that the anguish played a \u201cmajor role\u201d in driving his wife, Rose, to suicide last summer. Part of Paterson\u2019s complaint was that investigators declined to take oral evidence from 17 witnesses who wanted to speak in his support. The standards committee \u2013 on which several Tory MPs sit \u2013 said the witnesses wanted to talk about their perception of Paterson\u2019s motivations, which would not substantially alter the facts about what rules had been broken. It added: \u201cWe do not see what further relevant information could usefully be gleaned by inviting oral evidence from the witnesses concerned.\u201d Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThat is an interesting view to come to, because other people might say: \u2018How do you know whether it was relevant to the inquiry until you\u2019ve taken their evidence and have found out the precise context of how things were done?\u2019\u201d Asked if Stone was mistaken, Rees-Mogg said he did not want to \u201cprejudge\u201d how MPs would vote on Wednesday. He confirmed that the motion to suspend Paterson would be amendable, meaning his supporters may choose to try to reduce the punishment, and left open the possibility Tory whips may instruct MPs to support such a move. Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThe government always has a responsibility to ensure that parliamentary business is dealt with efficiently, in a timely manner, and that the reputation of parliament and the government is upheld in all senses. Therefore, applying whips to individual votes \u2013 however serious they are \u2013 is perfectly reasonable.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister sympathised with Rees-Mogg\u2019s criticisms of the investigation into Paterson\u2019s conduct. Asked about the comments by the leader of the house, he said: \u201cThis is a detailed report, a 175-page report, with complex issues and evidence which need to be looked at carefully. As the commission\u2019s remit doesn\u2019t look at the conduct of government ministers, I can\u2019t comment any further.\u201d \u201cThis is a matter for MPs,\u201d the spokesman added. He also declined to say whether or how Johnson would vote on the sanctions against Paterson, saying only: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get to tomorrow.\u201d Chris Bryant, the chair of the standards committee, said it \u201cconsidered Paterson\u2019s complaints about the process and rebutted each of his points in the report\u201d, and added: \u201cIn the end, the facts speak for themselves.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/jacob-rees-mogg-questions-fairness-of-owen-paterson-suspension-vote", "last_update": "2021-11-02T13:25:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Met police officers plead guilty over photos taken at scene of sisters\u2019 deaths", "article": "A police officer made degrading and sexist insults about two murdered women as he shared pictures from the scene where they were found with a colleague photographing their bodies and also sharing the images via WhatsApp. The two Metropolitan police officers pleaded guilty on Tuesday after sharing photographs from the crime scene they were supposed to be guarding in a London park, where two sisters, Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, were found stabbed to death. PC Deniz Jaffer, 48, and PC Jamie Lewis, 33, admitted misconduct in public office at the Old Bailey, with the judge, Mark Lucraft QC, warning that they were \u201cextremely likely\u201d to be jailed. Jaffer left the post he had been assigned to in June 2020 at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, and went into bushes where the women had been left by their satanist-obsessed killer. The officer took out a mobile phone and took pictures of the bodies. He sent four images to Lewis, who edited one of the photos and superimposed his face on to it with the two murdered women visible in the background. Lewis took other photos from the crime scene, which did not show the victims, and shared them with a group of more than 40 officers via WhatsApp who called themselves the \u201cA-team\u201d. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said Lewis had \u201cused degrading and sexist language to describe the victims\u201d. A spokesperson confirmed the remarks were directed at the murder victims and it was fair to characterise the remarks as insulting. Henry, a senior social worker, and Smallman, a photographer, had been celebrating the elder sister\u2019s birthday in the park. After the celebration ended, they stayed behind and were attacked. They were reported missing the next day and a search by family and friends led to the partner of one of the sisters finding their bodies. The family of the murdered women were last week backed by the police watchdog in their claims the Met had let them down when the force failed to search for the two sisters after they went missing. The scandal, first revealed by the Guardian, has further blighted the Met\u2019s reputation and the guilty pleas meant more detail about the officers\u2019s actions were finally revealed. On Tuesday, the women\u2019s mother, Mina Smallman, said the Met was \u201cbeyond hope\u201d and called for its leaders to \u201cget the rot out once and for all\u201d. She accused the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, of a \u201cshoddy way of behaving\u201d. She said: \u201cShe has not contacted us to say \u2018I am really sorry\u2019. She has not spoken into this story at all. And it\u2019s shameful that the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] had to tell the Met they should apologise to us in their failings for the missing persons [investigation]. Too little, too late. Too little, too late. \u201cWhen I was in a senior position, if my organisation or department failed, it was on me. I had to take the can for it. Well, it\u2019s now time for them to take the can for it. They are beyond hope.\u201d The Guardian understands that Jaffer was a mentor for new recruits. The Met say he resigned in August and that he and Lewis will face a fast-track process to sack them. Jaffer, of Hornchurch in east London, and Lewis, from Colchester in Essex, were based with the Met\u2019s North East Area Command. The judge told the men he viewed their offences as grave enough to merit lengthy imprisonment: \u201cThese matters are extremely serious and you should be under no illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some length for your conduct.\u201d The indictment says the offences took place between 7 June, the day the bodies were found, and 23 June 2020. In a statement after the guilty pleas, the Crown Prosecution Service said: \u201cPC Lewis edited one of the pictures by superimposing his own face on to the photograph with the victims in the background. He sent the resulting image to PC Jaffer, who then forwarded it unsolicited to a female officer also present at the scene. \u201cPC Jaffer showed one of the photos of the victims to a male officer as they left the park. PC Lewis also shared photographs he had taken at the crime scene, which did not show the victims, with a WhatsApp group of 40-plus police officers called the A Team. \u201cPC Jaffer, meanwhile, sent photographs of the victims to three friends via WhatsApp.\u201d Dick said: \u201cI deeply regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers. What former PC Jaffer and PC Lewis chose to do that day was utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive.\u201d The officers will be sentenced at a later date and were granted bail. Danyal Hussein, who was 18 at the time, from Blackheath in south London, has been convicted of the murder of both sisters and jailed for life. The IOPC said that three officers who received the images but did not report them had a case to answer for misconduct.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/met-police-officers-plead-guilty-over-photos-taken-at-scene-of-sisters-deaths", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:03:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Objectivity concerns over UN\u2019s report on Tigray civil war ", "article": "An international human rights investigation into the brutal civil war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray province will be published on Wednesday amid concerns that the scope of the UN inquiry has been constrained by both Addis Ababa and the ongoing conflict. Due to be released almost exactly a year after the conflict began, the joint UN Human Rights Office and government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), will nevertheless be the most authoritative overview of the war and its consequences. Independent human rights groups, humanitarian organisations and foreign media are banned from Tigray, in a conflict where at least tens of thousands have died and there have been accusations of sexual violence and deliberate starvation. Investigators were allowed to visit Tigray however, because of the partnership with the EHRC \u2013 but were not able to visit all key locations, including the site of an alleged massacre in Axum in November 2020 by Eritrean troops fighting alongside the Ethiopian government.\nThe involvement of the EHRC has left Tigrayan leaders sceptical about the investigation\u2019s independence \u2013 while the conflict, which saw much of Tigray recaptured by rebels over the summer, has created further difficulties. David Crane, the founder of the Global Accountability Network and founding chief prosecutor for the special court for Sierra Leone, an international tribunal, said: \u201cWhat you need when you go into an atrocity zone is a clean slate so outside investigators can look into it neutrally, dispassionately. \u201cYou want to do these things where you don\u2019t build doubt, distrust from the beginning,\u201d including among people interviewed, he added. Ethiopia expelled seven senior UN officials last month, including the human rights officer Sonny Onyegbula, who was working on the report. Addis Ababa accused the officials of \u201cmeddling in internal affairs\u201d. Rising tensions between the Ethiopian government led by Abiy Ahmed and the Tigrayan TPLF, previously the dominant group in the country\u2019s politics, led to the start of fighting in November 2020. Initially, Ethiopia, in alliance with neighbouring Eritrea, seized control of Tigray, amid multiple reports of atrocities. Tigrayan forces regrouped and staged a counterattack, regaining much of Tigray in June and capturing parts of neighbouring provinces. Despite a recent counterattack by Ethiopian forces in October, the TPLF claims to have gained further ground, seizing strategic towns on the road to Addis, prompting speculation that the capital itself could fall to the rebels. In a sign of paranoia around the fate of Addis Ababa, state media called on Monday for residents to register weapons in the next two days. On Sunday, Ahmed called for citizens to \u201cuse any type of weapons to block the destructive [rebel push], to overturn it and bury it\u201d. \u201cDying for Ethiopia is a duty for all of us,\u201d he said. The rights report only covers the period from November 2020 to 28 June 2021, when the TPLF recaptured Mekelle, the province\u2019s capital, and is based on 269 interviews with victims and witnesses, as well as with other sources. Some involved in the investigation told the Associated Press that the head of the EHRC, Daniel Bekele, underplayed some allegations that fighters from the country\u2019s Amhara region were responsible for abuses and pressed to highlight abuses by Tigray forces. But Bekele asserted the commission\u2019s independence, saying it was \u201cprimarily accountable to the people it is created to serve\u201d and that he and the commission had consistently cited \u201cserious indications that all parties involved in the conflict have committed atrocities\u201d. Bekele also said the investigation lacked the support of the Tigray authorities now administering the region. The UN has said Ethiopia\u2019s government had no say in the report\u2019s publication, though it was given the chance to read it in advance and to point out \u201canything it believes to be incorrect\u201d. It has acknowledged there have been difficulties in accessing key locations. Last week, Ethiopia\u2019s government released the results of its own investigations focusing on alleged abuses by Tigray forces. The ministry of justice said it found 483 non-combatants were killed and 109 raped in parts of Amhara and Afar that have been recaptured by federal forces in recent weeks. The spokesperson for the Tigray forces, Getachew Reda, said the allegations were not worth \u201cthe paper they\u2019re written on\u201d. Accusations of rapes and killings by Tigray forces are \u201cabsolutely untrue, at least on a level these organisations are alleging,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/report-on-tigray-civil-war-to-be-released-amid-objectivity-concerns", "last_update": "2021-11-02T13:26:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Life, death and limbo in the Calais \u2018Jungle\u2019 \u2013 five years after its demolition", "article": "A small group of Ethiopian and Eritrean men stand shoeless and shivering in Calais. A few hours earlier, they almost drowned in the Channel, trying to cross to the UK. They got into difficulty when the motor on their boat failed. Their jeans are stiff and sodden with sand and seawater. \u201cWe called the French coastguard to rescue us but they told us to call the English coastguard,\u201d says one man. \u201cEventually, the French rescued us and brought us back to Calais. \u201cI studied political science at university in my country and I want to work and contribute in the UK. I do not know what I can do now. I can\u2019t go back and I can\u2019t go forward. There is a lot of racism in this situation. We need to find peace. If we have no peace we have no life.\u201d Five years ago this week, workers dressed in orange jumpsuits and white hard hats came with sledgehammers and diggers to demolish the refugee camp that had been dubbed \u201cthe Jungle\u201d by the migrants living there in this city on the northern French coast. The squalid 1.5 sq mile (3.9 sq km) area of scrubland had become a symbol of Europe\u2019s migration crisis after more than 1 million desperate people \u2013 many escaping the conflict in Syria \u2013 fled to Europe by sea during 2015, according to UNHCR data.\nMigrants and police at the \u2018Old Lidl\u2019 site in Calais. The police clear the site regularly, evicting anyone living there and seizing remaining belongings. Today, the Jungle has gone, but the migrants remain \u2013 a report from Human Rights Watch, using data from local charities, estimates there are still about 2,000 migrants \u201cin wooded areas, in and around disused warehouses, and under bridges in and around Calais\u201d, including about 300 unaccompanied children. Several hundred more are camped in a forest near Dunkirk. The migrants waiting in these areas are at the centre of a political storm. In the UK, the home secretary\u2019s draconian nationality and borders bill, which includes plans to punish asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats with a jail sentence and a ban on receiving state funds, looms on the horizon. There is growing hostility to the migrants on the French side, too, with police in Calais daily evicting the threadbare camps that replaced the Jungle. Authorities have even installed large rocks and boulders at some of the regular distribution points to prevent aid vans parking. Brexit has slowed shipments of clothing and other essential items. On a patch of bare ground known as \u201cOld Lidl\u201d \u2013 it was once the site of a Lidl store \u2013 dozens of young men, mostly Sudanese, gather to replenish their water supplies and charge their phones via large portable power banks.\nA man sits alone on the former site of the Jungle. They laugh and joke, but they look tired, lines prematurely etched in some of their young faces \u2013 and all are underweight, baggy jeans flapping around their legs. One of them leads us to a small area of woodland where a group of young men are sleeping in a clearing, surrounded by rubbish. One is dozing in an open cardboard box; another is lying on the ground with his legs covered in blankets. He says he is struggling to walk because he was beaten badly by the police. \u201cOur routine is the same every day and every night,\u201d says a third man. \u201cWe try and sleep a bit during the day if we can. Then we go to bed about 8pm. At midnight every night we wake up and try to cross the Channel. We try to find a boat we can cross in ourselves because we don\u2019t have the money to pay the smugglers. Usually we don\u2019t succeed. We hurry back here by 6am so we can hide our few belongings before the police come to evict us every morning. Then the same cycle starts again.\u201d\nThe migrants here \u2013 from Sudan, Eritrea, Kurdistan and more recently Vietnam (who are said to be accompanied by traffickers) are undeterred in their plans to seek safety in the UK. The number of asylum applications in Britain fell in 2020 to 29,456 (significantly lower than the 93,475 asylum applications made in France and the 121,955 in Germany). However, migrant small boat crossings from northern France to the UK are at record levels. These Sudanese young men are gloomy about their chances of reaching the UK. One, who came here via Libya, shows us a photograph on his phone of a 16-year-old boy known as Yasser, also Sudanese, who died on 28 September trying to board a truck at Calais. He had hoped he could secretly reach the UK by clinging on to the vehicle. \u201cHe was my friend,\u201d says the young man showing the boy\u2019s photo. \u201cHe was so small. Like the rest of us, all he wanted was to live in a safe place. We call Priti Patel \u2018Madame No\u2019 because she won\u2019t allow us to do this.\u201d\nSeveral hundred migrants are camped in a forest near Dunkirk. The squalid conditions will only become worse in winter. The French media has reported a second similar death of a young migrant trying to board a truck to the UK on 21 October. \u201cThe only thing in our lives now is to get across the Channel,\u201d the young man continues. \u201cMy hair has grown long. I have said I will not cut it until I reach the UK.\u201d This desperation is just as palpable in neighbouring Dunkirk. The Grande-Synthe camp here is home to several hundred migrants, many of whom are Kurdish. They, too, have endured difficult journeys \u2013 some spent years stuck in camps in Greece. When we visit, the sun is shining and the autumn air is still warm in the forest area where the camp is based. The mud paths are dry now, but when the rain and snow come the area will be treacherous to navigate. Refugee barbers trim the hair of friends and family members, unofficial shopkeepers sell soft drinks on folding tables and Kurdish music blares. This group is more likely to have the money to pay smugglers, so tend to spend shorter periods of time here before crossing to the UK \u2013 some have enough money to buy a few essentials from the nearby supermarket.\nCharities including Care 4 Calais (top) and Refugee Info Bus (bottom) provide migrants with food, water, clothing and phone charging services. However, the funder Choose Love is due to stop financing at least seven local charities. Navid, a Kurd who speaks perfect English, was forced to flee Iran after he took part in protests against the government, an action which is punishable by death, and was called to appear in court. \u201cI studied mechanical engineering at one of the best universities in Iran,\u201d he says. \u201cI travelled through nine countries to get here; a lot of the time I was walking. The journey took months. I hope I can cross the Channel to the UK soon. We are refugees. We have no other way.\u201d One woman from Eritrea sits in the mud with her five-month-old baby. Her two older children play nearby. Like many, she is fleeing more than one problem. She escaped Eritrea as a child with her family and grew up in Sudan, a country she eventually had to escape from, too, arriving in Germany where she sought sanctuary. She married a man there who became increasingly violent and threatening, forcing her to run once again, this time with three young children in tow. \u201cEverything is shit,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no other words to describe my situation.\u201d While anti-migrant groups and politicians crank up the pressure on Patel to take a tough line on those trying to reach the UK, human rights campaigners say the home secretary\u2019s plans to make Channel crossings \u201cunviable\u201d is simply putting more lives at risk \u2013 as desperate people have little other choice but to attempt to cross regardless.\nTwo migrants who spoke to the Guardian. The man on the right had tried to cross the Channel the night before. For those migrants here who are still waiting to get across, their precarious situation is expected to deteriorate. Choose Love, a major funder, is due to stop financing at least seven local charities in Calais and Dunkirk that provide migrants with food, water, clothing, phone charging, materials for basic shelter and firewood for cooking and keeping warm. Choose Love is one of the most high-profile funders supporting refugees in northern France; Coldplay, Dua Lipa, Olivia Colman, Jude Law, Stella McCartney and others have raised funds for it.\nMeanwhile, the police evictions continue. According to the organisation Human Rights Observers, police conducted more than 950 routine eviction operations in Calais and at least 90 routine evictions in Grande-Synthe in 2020, seizing nearly 5,000 tents and tarps and hundreds of sleeping bags and blankets. We watch one such morning eviction in Calais. Five police vans turn up, the migrants pick up their bedding and stand to the side, the cleaning trucks come to take away any remaining belongings, before the migrants return to the same place to bed down once more, waiting to attempt the Channel again. Today, the cleaning truck leaves empty. These migrants have no belongings left for them to take. While refugees are denied access to running water, electricity and a roof over their heads \u2013 typical war zone conditions \u2013 they are living just yards from French citizens who have access to all these things in their suburban homes.\nAnti-eviction protesters Ludovic Holbein, Ana\u00efs Vogel and Philippe Demeest\u00e8re in St Pierre church, Calais. The disparity is not wasted on local human rights campaigners, who have embarked on a hunger strike, which they say they will not stop until the French authorities halt the evictions. \u201cWe tried to have discussions and protests in the street, but nothing changed. So we had to take radical action,\u201d says Ana\u00efs Vogel, one of the strikers from the Secours Catholique charity based in St Pierre church, Calais. \u201cWe want the evictions to stop. Everyone is human and everyone is equal.\u201d Back in Grande-Synthe, we meet Rashid, 45, a Kurdish man from Iraq. He has been in Dunkirk for only two days, but it has taken him several years to reach this camp. As an IT worker and security guard, he says he was asked to take part in state corruption, refused, and had to flee. He crossed from Turkey to Greece, where he was stuck for three years. \u201cFive times we tried to cross to Albania from Greece, but each time we were pushed back,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made it to Albania eventually and spent 50 hours walking through the mountains. We were so tired and wanted to stop, but we couldn\u2019t. Here, my clothes are wet because water comes into our tent, but my life is safe. In this country, I am not scared to sleep in the street.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/life-death-and-limbo-in-the-calais-jungle-five-years-after-its-demolition", "last_update": "2021-11-03T10:10:16Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Australia considering more than 100 fossil fuel projects that could produce 5% of global industrial emissions", "article": "Australia has more than 100 fossil fuel developments in the pipeline that could result in nearly 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year \u2013 equivalent to about 5% of global industrial emissions \u2013 if all were to go ahead, an analysis says. The Australian government lists 116 major coal and gas projects under development, each valued at more than A$50m and with the potential to reach a final investment decision in the next five years. Not all will be built, but a new report says it is an indication of the fossil fuel development that continues in Australia, including with taxpayer support, despite the Morrison government committing to net zero emissions by 2050. Launching a plan for the country to reach the target last week ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the government would \u201cnot shut down our coal or gas production\u201d. The plan said the country\u2019s fossil fuel export industries would continue \u201cthrough to 2050 and beyond, supporting jobs and regional communities\u201d. Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, has also promised to use Cop26 to promote Australia as a safe and reliable place to invest in gas and hydrogen.\nAn analysis by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, found the most recent data from the energy and resources department\u2019s chief economist, published last December, listed 72 coal and 44 gas and oil projects with the potential to be developed. The institute also included the proposed Beetaloo Basin gas field in the Northern Territory, which the government has committed up to $224m to develop as part of what it calls a \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d from the pandemic. Based on the estimated annual capacity of each proposal, it found together they could add about 146m tonnes to emissions within Australia (equivalent to a nearly 30% annual increase) during extraction and processing. The overwhelming bulk of the emissions \u2013 about 1.6bn tonnes \u2013 would be released offshore after the coal and gas was sold and burned for energy. About two-thirds of the coal projects were listed as at feasibility stage. Government officials noted there was a growing preference for mine expansions over greenfield projects and that some lenders and investors would no longer finance thermal coal, which is used in electricity generation. Richie Merzian, a former Australian government climate negotiator now with the Australia Institute, said the country continued to pursue an aggressive expansion of fossil fuels with potential emissions on the list equivalent to more than 200 coal-fired power plants. \u201cAustralia cannot claim to be acting on climate change while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel projects,\u201d he said. The Morrison government\u2019s position on fossil fuels is that cost and global markets will dictate the pace of the shift to cleaner technology. It has approved the expansion of four coalmines since September and in July granted a $175m loan for a new metallurgical coalmine in Queensland. On gas, it has said it hoped to develop four more basins after Beetaloo. State and territory governments under both the Coalition and Labor also back fossil fuel expansion. Hugh Saddler, an energy analyst and an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University, said the federal government was \u201cjust plugging on absolutely business-as-usual\u201d on fossil fuels. \u201cThere\u2019s been no thought about how you fit that into some supposed plan to reach net zero by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the important thing to stop the most catastrophic climate change is to stop fossil fuels, but Australia is putting its foot on the accelerator to develop coal and gas as quickly as it can and putting taxpayers\u2019 dollars into doing that.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s 2050 net zero emissions plan has been criticised for not including new policies and relying on new technology to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the 2030s and 40s. It says it is committing $20bn over a decade to help lower the cost of some technologies. Most of the spending is a continuation of long-standing funding for clean energy agencies. The government has backed carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology \u2013 burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground \u2013 to extend their life, and committed $250m to a \u201cCCS technologies and hubs\u201d program. Australian governments have previously committed about $4bn in funding for CCS, but it has failed to prove commercially viable. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered delays and operational problems, and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe gas company Santos confirmed on Monday it would proceed with a $220m CCS development at the Moomba gas reservoir in South Australia after the Morrison government approved it to earn revenue from carbon credits for storing emissions below ground. Santos said the project could store 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024. The gas industry group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the Australia Institute\u2019s analysis should not be considered \u201cobjective, scientific or reasonable\u201d as the thinktank had made its opposition to the industry \u201cvery clear\u201d. Its chief executive, Andrew McConville, said it would be more constructive for people to listen to those that had recognised gas had a role to play in a low-emissions future, including the International Energy Agency, the United Nations, and Australia\u2019s former chief scientist Alan Finkel. Some have backed gas \u2013 which has about half the emissions of coal when burned, and more when methane leaks during extraction \u2013 as playing an ongoing role as the world moves away from coal, but few have backed opening new gas fields.\nThe head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, earlier this year said there should be \u201cno new investments in oil, gas and coal from now\u201d if governments were serious about the climate crisis. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday said Australia had to \u201cface up to the fact that we\u2019ve got to stop burning coal and gas\u201d. \u201cThe proposition that seems to be fashionable in some quarters here that we can keep on burning coal, and indeed exporting coal, and that somehow is consistent with getting to net zero by 2050, is nonsense,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast. \u201cThe reality is if we keep burning fossil fuels we will fry the planet.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/australia-considering-more-than-100-fossil-fuel-projects-that-could-produce-5-of-global-industrial-emissions", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:58:43Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Like a scene from Arachnophobia\u2019: large Joro spiders invade northern Georgia", "article": "Northern Georgia has found itself besieged by millions of large yellow, blue and red spiders, in scenes residents say bring to mind the movie Arachnophobia.\nThe Joro spider is an invasive species, native to east Asia, that was first spotted in Georgia in 2014. Since then, the 3in arachnid appears to have thrived in the warm climes of the state. Its presence has upset locals, however, particularly given its propensity to spin dense webs up to 3 metres deep. Jennifer Turpin, a self-described arachnophobe who lives in Atlanta, told the Associated Press she stopped blowing leaves in her yard after walking into a Joro web. Turpin, 50, said she tried to set a web on fire but became concerned the web would fall on her. She swiftly backpedaled, only to fall into a hole. Turpin asked a neighbor remove the spider. \u201cI just don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do yard work any more,\u201d Turpin said. Debbie Gilbert, from Norcross, 20 miles north-east of Atlanta, was also forced to take matters into her own hands. She said she uses a stick to wind up the webs, before tossing it, spiders and all, to the ground. The 67-year-old then stomped on the spiders, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t advocate killing anything,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cI live in peace with all the spiders around here and everything else. But [Joros] just don\u2019t belong here, that\u2019s all.\u201d Joro spiders, or Trichonephila clavata, are common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. It is unclear how they made their way to the US. Researchers say the particular abundance of the spiders this year could be down to changes in weather. It is unclear whether the spider will have a negative impact on native flora and fauna, as do other invasive species, including the notorious spotted lanternfly. Ann Rypstra, who studies spider behavior at Miami University, told the AP more research was needed. \u201cI\u2019d always err on the side of caution when you have something that establishes itself where it\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d she said. In the meantime, people across north Georgia are trying to come to terms with their new neighbours. In Winterville, Will Hudson\u2019s front porch became unusable amid an abundance of Joro webs 10ft deep. An entomologist at the University of Georgia, he said that he had killed more than 300 of the spiders. \u201cThe webs are a real mess,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cNobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spider web.\u201d Hudson said that though the spiders can bite, they are not a threat to humans. A researcher collecting them with her bare hands reported the occasional pinch, he said, but said the spiders never broke her skin. \u201cLast year there were dozens of spiders, and they began to be something of a nuisance when I was doing yard work,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThis year, I have several hundred, and they actually make the place look spooky with all the messy webs \u2013 like a scene out of Arachnophobia.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/georgia-joro-spiders-invasive-species-asia", "last_update": "2021-11-02T14:05:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Antonio Conte\u2019s attraction for Spurs is clear \u2013 he wins wherever he goes | Nicky Bandini", "article": "Antonio Conte believes he can end a 13-year trophy drought at Tottenham. He has not said so publicly just yet, but this is a man who has described the pursuit of victory as \u201can obsession, a drug\u201d. When Conte joined Internazionale in 2019, he told the Italian edition of GQ magazine: \u201cI can accept having only a small chance of winning at the start, even just 1%, but there has to be at least that much.\u201d\nThe Nerazzurri were nine years removed from their last Serie A title. Conte needed only two to put them back on top. In his first season at San Siro, Inter improved by 13 points and reached the Europa League final. A year later, they were champions of Italy, sealing their title with four games to spare. Even that was slow going by the manager\u2019s standards. At his two previous clubs, Conte won at the first attempt. Juventus finished seventh in consecutive seasons before he arrived in 2011 and led them to the Scudetto without defeat. Chelsea were the Premier League\u2019s 10th-best team under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Guus Hiddink in 2015-16, then champions with Conte in 2016-17. This is the Italian\u2019s brand: a man who just wins, wherever he goes. A \u201cguarantee\u201d, as he has often been defined by pundits in his home country, even though such terms make him bristle. As the one lifting the trophies, Conte is always quick to remind any interviewer that no victory is inevitable, and every result hard-earned.\nWinning at Inter was, in his perception, most difficult of all. The club\u2019s identity seemed to exist in direct opposition to his own, and not only because he had spent so much of his career working for Juventus, a great rival. One of Conte\u2019s first acts was to ban the playing of Pazza Inter before kick-off, a beloved anthem which calls on fans to embrace the \u201ccraziness\u201d and unpredictability of their team. That trait was always overstated. Inter had won 18 league titles before Conte arrived \u2013 a figure only Juventus could better. They had underachieved heavily in the decade since winning the treble under Mourinho, however, routinely finishing outside the top four despite one of the highest wage bills in Serie A. Throughout his tenure, Conte repeated that his first objective was to make Inter \u201ccredible\u201d again. Perhaps that would be an appropriate starting point at Tottenham. In the past two years the club has gone backwards, from a Champions League final to the Europa Conference League, via an Amazon Prime documentary series and a 3-0 humiliation in Zagreb.\nThose unfamiliar with Conte\u2019s mindset might ask why he would consider taking on the team in their present state. A man who has won league titles in five out of his past seven seasons of club management could doubtless have landed a more comfortable position if he had chosen to wait. The prospect of a year out will not have daunted him. Conte took a sabbatical in 2018-19 after he parted company with Chelsea. Although \u201cthe need to work hard is in my DNA\u201d, he confessed to enjoying the opportunity to be with family and swim in \u201cmy sea\u201d where he grew up in Puglia. This summer his social media was awash with pictures of him revisiting those waters.\nIf anything, it may be the scale of the challenge at Tottenham that has intrigued him. \u201cI like putting myself in play,\u201d Conte has said. \u201cInter were the extreme limit of this approach. I had a lot to lose. But I have a hard head, so I press forward, ready to knock down walls with this head of mine.\u201d Equally, though, he is not a man to charge in without assessing the scale of the challenge. The fact that Conte was available is testament to his unwillingness to work in conditions he considers unfavourable. He left Inter because he did not believe he could build on his successes while the club sought to slash 20% from its wage bill.\nWhat assurances has he received from his former Juventus colleague Fabio Paratici, the managing director of football at Spurs? It is easy to imagine Conte being enticed by the opportunity to work with Harry Kane, whom he described in 2017 as \u201cone of the best strikers in the world\u201d. Yet the player has struggled for form this season after being denied a move. Tottenham may view Conte as a good bet to help the striker get back to his best. The manager found the right buttons to press with another brilliant No 9, Romelu Lukaku, who produced the best football of his career at Inter, piling up 47 goals and 13 assists in two Serie A seasons while adding almost 50% to his market value.\nThat was not his first success story with a tall and physical centre-forward. Graziano Pell\u00e8 went beyond the limits that most imagined for him while wearing an Italy shirt under Conte, and Diego Costa scored 20 times to fire Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2017, even if the relationship did break down immediately afterwards. Certainly, it is easy to imagine how Kane and Son Heung-min would dovetail well at the top of Conte\u2019s preferred 3-5-2. The summer loan signing Cristian Romero could also benefit from returning to such a system, playing between two other centre-backs as he did at Atalanta. What guarantees, though, have Tottenham offered to Conte? He has always demanded that clubs who employ him match his ambition with investment. He left Juventus after infamously suggesting that nobody should expect to eat in a \u20ac100 restaurant for \u20ac10. He blamed a disappointing second season at Chelsea on the club\u2019s failure to deliver him Lukaku and Virgil van Dijk. His critics will accuse him of always wanting more, pointing out the many players signed to support his vision at both clubs. In Italy it did not escape anyone\u2019s attention that Inter found their best form last season after a January in which financial constraints prevented them from making any moves. The manager was obliged to work on getting the most from players who had been marginalised, including the former Tottenham man Christian Eriksen. What Conte wants and what he needs to succeed may be two different things, yet it seems inconceivable that a man with his CV and personality would take any job on somebody else\u2019s terms. He believes he can win trophies at a club where Mourinho, Mauricio Pochettino and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas failed to do so. The least that Conte will expect from Spurs is to share in his vision for how that can be achieved.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/02/antonio-conte-attraction-spurs-clear-he-wins-wherever-he-goes", "last_update": "2021-11-02T13:03:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Breakdown | \u2018Survive then thrive\u2019: All Blacks want to lead rugby\u2019s new global outlook", "article": "The trickiest job in New Zealand? It used to be generally accepted that even the prime minister had it easier than the incumbent All Blacks head coach. Now, though, there is a third contender, requiring the former\u2019s diplomatic touch and the latter\u2019s survival instincts. To be NZ Rugby\u2019s chief executive at this juncture in rugby history is to be caught between the devil and the deep blue Pacific. Put yourself in Mark Robinson\u2019s jandals for a second. On the one hand he presides over the most marketable national team in the world, which is not the worst gig. On the other he represents a country at odds over whether a chunk of NZ Rugby\u2019s commercial operations should be sold to a US-based private equity firm. Squaring that contradictory circle \u2013 \u201crugby means an awful lot to our country\u2019s identity and psyche\u201d \u2013 will define Robinson\u2019s stewardship, with significant implications for every other rugby-playing country in the world.\nBecause, make no mistake, these are critical weeks and months for rugby\u2019s global commercial future. As with the climate emergency the clock is ticking and, having talked to various other senior officials over the weekend, the urgency and tension is mounting. \u201cIt has to happen now,\u201d said one, referring to the renewed push to agree a streamlined global fixture calendar. \u201cA lot of unions are hurting at the moment.\u201d The upshot is that everyone, not least New Zealand, will need to embrace people and/or rival unions they have often treated with a mixture of scepticism or indifference. During the era of the previous NZ Rugby chief executive, Steve Tew, the All Blacks\u2019 attitude was mostly a blunt: \u2018Take it or leave it.\u2019 Encouraged by cash-strapped European nations to fly north outside the official window, they have long since hired themselves out at a punchy rate. Playing in Cardiff against a weakened Welsh side last Saturday, for example, was worth \u00a32m to NZ Rugby, which may explain why the head coach, Ian Foster, took a potshot or two at the media for questioning the fixture\u2019s legitimacy. Playing non-lucrative away Tests in the Pacific Islands, strangely, has tended to be less of a priority. It also says a fair amount about rugby\u2019s uneasy north-south marriage that, outside World Cups, England have faced the All Blacks once in the past seven years, a 16-15 loss at Twickenham in 2018. This lack of mutual interaction has not benefited either party, nor updated age-old prejudices on both sides, while southern hemisphere players relocating to lucrative European or Japanese leagues remains another underlying source of friction. For many of the above reasons, the 47-year-old Robinson is an increasingly key figure. Having spoken to him twice in recent days, the first thing to say is he is far more approachable than his predecessor and many of those masquerading as European rugby\u2019s biggest cheeses. The second is that, perhaps uniquely for a senior NZ Rugby administrator, he genuinely loves the UK. In addition to winning nine caps for the All Blacks, he studied at Cambridge University and shared in two winning Varsity matches in an era when the Light Blues won five years in a row.\nTwickenham, as a result, holds fond memories and he also used to play rugby in Taranaki with Beauden and Jordie Barrett\u2019s father, Kevin. A good enough player to have been selected on a couple of occasions ahead of Tana Umaga in the All Blacks\u2019 midfield, he featured in the same half-decent starting backline as Christian Cullen, Doug Howlett, Jonah Lomu and Andrew Mehrtens against France in 2002. Unusually for a leading administrator, he knows how it feels to tour around sodden, wintry European fields in the professional era with every opponent desperate to take a slice out of you. Had it not been for his studies and bad luck with injuries, he might have had an even more decorated career but, given his nicely balanced CV, you can understand why NZ Rugby anointed him as Tew\u2019s successor just before the world shuttered up against Covid. Completing a deal with the US technology investment firm Silver Lake after the players\u2019 union vetoed the initial $NZ387.5m offer remains a clear priority \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be prepared to put a timescale on it but it\u2019s heading in the right direction\u201d \u2013 but ask what will happen if things go completely pear-shaped and his easy-going tone hardens slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re not the kind or organisation that gives up easily. It\u2019s the Kiwi way. We would keep searching for the opportunity. The game has many mouths to feed and we\u2019ll have to find a way to keep doing that.\u201d Robinson is also smart enough to understand that even the mighty All Blacks can not stand still in changing times. In an open letter to New Zealanders in May he did not mince his words, suggesting the traditional Kiwi rugby model \u201cis broken\u201d and urging supporters to embrace change. He would be instantly sacked for suggesting the national team should lose more often but knows that visiting the United States to consult NBA and NFL teams about commercial strategy and event management, as the All Blacks did last month, will be of limited value unless global rugby becomes collectively healthier.\nThrashing the US Eagles 104-14 is unlikely to woo many casual American fans and the same two teams winning the past four World Cups does not offer a perfect future growth blueprint either. \u201cWhat we want to see an international environment with a greater depth and breadth of talent and competition,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThat has to be a vision we all aspire to. We\u2019re really interested in what the game can look like as more of a truly global sport.\u201d It explains why NZ Rugby is right behind a World Cup in the US in 2031, will be in the (virtual) room this month for talks with representatives of all the major club leagues and will happily host a women\u2019s Lions tour should the opportunity ever arise, not just to generate more income to fund their domestic grassroots but \u201cto create more value across the whole rugby ecosystem\u201d. Because even Robinson and his marketable All Blacks can sense the onrushing financial chill if rugby does not pull together now. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely critical time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to make sure as many rugby organisations can firstly survive and then look to create some models that can really help it thrive.\n\u201cI am optimistic we can create something with a stronger narrative around the international game but it takes a lot of consultation, listening and hard work. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s too big, at the moment, to think they\u2019re got the answers to everything.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract from our rugby union email, the Breakdown.

{"title": "Pfizer raises Covid-19 vaccine sales forecast to $36bn for 2021", "article": "The US drugmaker Pfizer has lifted its 2021 forecast for revenues from its Covid vaccine to $36bn (\u00a326.3bn), and forecast another $29bn sales next year after it started shipping booster jabs and shots for children. The Covid jab, called Comirnaty and developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech, contributed $13bn of revenues in the three months to 30 September. That was more than half of Pfizer\u2019s total revenues of $24bn in the quarter, which rose 134% from a year earlier. In the first six months of the year, Corminaty revenues were $11.3bn. Pfizer, which shares profits on the Covid vaccine evenly with BioNTech, raised its 2021 forecast for Corminaty sales from $33.5bn in July, as it expects to deliver 2.3bn doses this year. Together with BioNTech, it continues to expect to manufacture 3bn doses by the end of December, although not all of them will be delivered by then. For next year, it has so far agreed contracts for 1.7bn doses. The jab was the first to gain approval for emergency use in the US for adults last year, and more recently for children and booster shots. Together with the US biotech firm Moderna, Pfizer accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the pharma industry\u2019s global revenues from Covid vaccines. Many western countries including the US, UK and Germany have started giving third booster shots to elderly and vulnerable people. However, booster jabs are controversial because in low-income countries only 3.7% of people have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. About 7.1bn doses have been administered globally, and nearly half the world\u2019s population has received at least one jab.\nThe jump in Covid vaccine revenues prompted Pfizer to lift its overall sales and earnings predictions. It now expects to make total revenues of up to $82bn this year, and underlying earnings a share of $4.13 to $4.18, compared with its previous forecast of $3.95 to $4.05. Pfizer faced fresh criticism from groups such as Amnesty International. The campaign group Global Justice Now accused Pfizer of \u201cmaking a killing\u201d out of \u201cthe most lucrative medicine ever produced,\u201d while \u201cmost of the world has been locked out of this vaccine\u201d. Its director, Nick Dearden, said: \u201cJust 1% of Pfizer\u2019s supplies have been sold to the international distribution mechanism Covax, as the company has put sales of third and fourth doses in wealthy markets ahead of selling doses to where they\u2019re most needed. This will undoubtedly prolong the pandemic.\u201d Responding to criticism, Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said poorer countries and organisations such as Covax needed to place orders, at a heavily discounted price, adding: \u201cWe remain on track to achieve our goal of delivering at least 2bn doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022 \u2013 at least 1bn to be delivered this year and 1bn next year.\u201d Bourla made a bold promise in June, saying that should the need arise for a new Covid vaccine, the company could develop one within 100 days. He was referring to the possible emergence of an \u201cescape variant\u201d \u2013 a strain of Sars-CoV-2 that evades the immunity provided by current vaccines and previous infections. Other companies, such as Moderna and AstraZeneca, are also preparing for the emergence of new strains by updating their current vaccines to match known variants such as delta, and testing them on these strains. These dress rehearsals are designed to even out kinks in the processes so the firms can move faster if an \u201cescape variant\u201d emerges for which current jabs do not work, Nature reported recently.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-sales-2021-biontech", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:57:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Northern Ireland leaders being shut out of Brexit talks, says Labour", "article": "The Labour party has called on the government and the EU to lift the \u201cveil of secrecy\u201d over the talks about new Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, urging them to give local political leaders a seat at the negotiations table. As the talks inch towards the deadline the UK government has set for making a decision to trigger article 16 and suspend parts of the protocol, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said it was unsustainable for leaders, businesses and civic society to be \u201cshut out\u201d on huge decisions being taken about their future. She made her remarks as the taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, revealed that the US president, Joe Biden, had pulled him aside after a formal Cop26 conference in Glasgow to tell him he was watching the Northern Ireland Brexit talks closely. \u201cHe called me aside after the meeting to, again, make it very clear to me that the United States takes the Good Friday agreement very seriously. To use his own words, \u2018it matters greatly to me and to the United States\u2019, and he said he has made this clear to the UK government.\u201d Speaking at the start of October, the Brexit minister, David Frost, said the conflict over the protocol needed to be settled within three weeks, but last week he said significant gaps remained between the two sides, particularly on state aid and the role of the European court of justice. Whitehall sources suggest the earliest a decision on triggering article 16 could be made is the third week in November, after Cop26.\nLord Frost and the European Commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d are due to meet on Friday to assess progress in talks. Earlier this week it emerged that Frost\u2019s drive to get the existing Northern Ireland protocol scrapped was as much rooted in opposition to the deal Theresa May struck in December 2017 as it was in delivering a new agreement to the unionist community that oppose the protocol. Writing in a foreword to a new paper for the Policy Exchange thinktank, Frost said the EU-UK joint report, which set the terms for the article 50 process of divorce from the EU, was a result of the UK failing to make \u201cthe necessary mental shift from being a member of the EU to negotiating exit from the EU\u201d. Haigh urged negotiators not to stoke tension over the protocol, which has prompted a resurgence in identity politics in Northern Ireland, and to bring local leaders in from the sidelines. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted in the House of Commons last week that democratically elected leaders in Northern Ireland had still not been privy to the UK\u2019s legal text of the negotiating position. \u201cIt is simply unsustainable for leaders, businesses and civic society to be shut out on huge decisions being made about their future,\u201d said Haigh. \u201cBusinesses and communities want a deal and with rising tension, the last thing Northern Ireland needs is more poisonous instability.\u201d \u201cIf the government are really acting in Northern Ireland\u2019s interests, rather than their own, then they should draw back the veil of secrecy, move the talks to Belfast, and give Northern Ireland a seat at the table,\u201d she added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/northern-ireland-leaders-being-shut-out-of-brexit-talks-says-labour", "last_update": "2021-11-02T16:04:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},

But just as we know the sun always rises in the east, tides rise and fall on schedule, and plutonium isotopes decay at a certain rate, you know that there will be a feature film, maybe starring Jonathan Pryce or even Tom Jones, made out of this documentary about a senior Welsh male voice choir. When film-maker Dylan Williams gets a phone call from his widowed nonagenarian father Ed saying he\u2019s sold the family home and is making plans for his own funeral, the director knows it\u2019s time to go home to Rhyl and spend some time with dad. Via voiceover from Dylan and nippily snipped editing we\u2019re introduced to Ed\u2019s tranquil, weekly rituals, from the weekly sheet change and Tuesday\u2019s bacon sandwich, to practice with the C\u00f4r Meibion Trelawnyd, the Welsh-language all-male choir he\u2019s been singing with for decades. A splice of archive footage shows Ed and some of his friends in the prime of middle age, belting it out on TV back in the day when the choir competed in singing competitions.\nThese days, there\u2019s a lot less competing and more assembling to sing at the funerals of fallen choristers as their numbers dwindle. Musical director Ann Atkinson, a former opera singer herself, recognises that if the choir is to survive they need to recruit men with brown hair (as opposed to white or grey), and soon Ed and some of his friends, including Dylan\u2019s primary school teacher Merf Richards, are hitting the supermarkets to hand out fliers and drum up new recruits. It\u2019s hard not to feel as if there\u2019s a bit of emotional arm-twisting going on here to get viewers moist with emotion over the film\u2019s deployment of adorable old geezers (one of whom even takes on wing walking to raise money), stirring music and the melancholy theme of inevitable death. Thankfully, Williams tamps down the sentimentality with a wry eye for comedy \u2013 for example when the choir sings in a shopping mall, all dressed as Santas \u2013 as well as a painterly eye for faces and locales.

This division is as much of a mistake as the error made by universities when they teach chemistry in a different class from biology and physics. It is impossible to understand these subjects in isolation because they are interconnected. The same is true of living organisms that greatly influence the global environment. The composition of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the temperature of the surface is actively maintained and regulated by the biosphere, by life, by what the ancient Greeks used to call Gaia. Almost 60 years ago, I suggested our planet self-regulated like a living organism. I called this the Gaia theory, and was later joined by biologist Lynn Margulis, who also espoused this idea. Both of us were roundly criticised by scientists in academia. I was an outsider, an independent scientist, and the mainstream view then was the neo-Darwinist one that life adapts to the environment, not that the relationship also works in the other direction, as we argued. In the years since, we have seen just how much life \u2013 especially human life \u2013 can affect the environment. Two genocidal acts \u2013 suffocation by greenhouse gases and the clearance of the rainforests \u2013 have caused changes on a scale not seen in millions of years. Because subjects like astronomy, geology, and meteorology are taught separately in schools and universities, few people are aware of the natural forces affecting the Earth\u2019s surface temperature. For billions of years the Earth\u2019s surface temperature has been determined mainly by the radiant heat coming from the sun. This energy increased over time because it is the nature of stars like the sun to increase their heat output as they grow older. But temperatures on Earth remained relatively stable thanks to Gaia: forests, oceans and other elements in the the Earth\u2019s regulating system, which kept the surface temperature fairly constant and near optimal for life. The global warming that concerns all of us, and which will be discussed this week in Glasgow, includes a great deal of extra heating that comes as a consequence of extracting and burning fossil fuels since about the middle of the 19th century. That releases methane, carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. They absorb radiant heat and stop it escaping from Earth. This is what causes global warming. The amount of global warming depends hugely on the properties of water. When cold ice forms, much of it is white snow. This reflects the sunlight back to space and is cooling. But when it is warm, the water vapour in the air is a powerful greenhouse gas that makes it warmer still. Much of the confusion over global heating comes about because of the huge quantities of heat needed to change the state of water. Few are aware that to melt a gram of ice takes 80 calories, enough heat to raise the temperature of 1ml of water to 80C. Try an ice cube in your boiling hot tea. Then imagine how much heat was needed to melt large areas of the polar ice cap during the recent summer and how much hotter the world would have been if the ice had not been there. No wonder there is confusion about whether there is global heating or not. Warnings that once seemed like the doom scenarios of science fiction are now coming to pass. We are entering into a heat age in which the temperature and sea levels will be rising decade by decade until the world becomes unrecognisable. We could also be in for more surprises. Nature is non-linear and unpredictable, never more than at a time of transition. Lowering these risks and adapting to those we can no longer avoid will require a mobilisation of resources on the scale of a war economy. We have no choice but to reduce the burning of fossil fuels or face even worse consequences. But we should also not become over-reliant on renewable power, which will leave us with an energy gap. We need to build more nuclear power stations to overcome that, though the greens will first have to get over their overblown fears of radiation. The dangers are nowhere near as bad as they are often painted. I\u2019ve travelled millions of miles by air, and all that time I have been exposed to levels of radiation that are ten times as great as at ground level. The dangers are exaggerated. We also need to address the problem of overpopulation and to urgently halt the destruction of tropical forests. Most of all, we need to look at the world in a holistic way. I am not hopeful of a positive outcome at Cop26, knowing who is participating. I was not invited to Glasgow, though that is hardly a surprise. As well as being 102 years old, I am an independent scientist, and the university academics have never been comfortable with that. But my fellow humans must learn to live in partnership with the Earth, otherwise the rest of creation will, as part of Gaia, unconsciously move the Earth to a new state in which humans may no longer be welcome. The virus, Covid-19, may well have been one negative feedback. Gaia will try harder next time with something even nastier.

Six authors are in the running for the \u00a350,000 award, with judges chaired by historian Maya Jasanoff set to meet on Wednesday to choose their winner before the award ceremony that evening. South African novelist Galgut\u2019s book, about a white family that fails to keep its promise to give a home to the Black woman who has worked for them her whole life in South Africa, is heading the charge, if the bookmakers are to be believed: the novel is 2/1 at both Ladbrokes and William Hill to take the prize. Galgut, who has been shortlisted twice before for the Booker but has never won, has said he felt \u201crelief, excitement and a fair amount of anxiety\u201d at making the shortlist. \u201cDamon Galgut has been all the rage with literary punters since making the shortlist, and if the money\u2019s to be believed The Promise will land this year\u2019s Booker,\u201d said Ladbrokes\u2019 Jessica O\u2019Reilly.\nThe three American writers shortlisted for the Booker follow Galgut in Ladbrokes\u2019 odds: Richard Powers\u2019s Bewilderment, in which widowed scientist Theo struggles to raise his profoundly troubled, passionately green young son, is at 4/1; Maggie Shipstead\u2019s Great Circle, about a vanished female aviator, is at 5/1 and Patricia Lockwood\u2019s internet-focused No One is Talking About This is at 6/1. Lockwood\u2019s debut \u2013 the only first novel on the shortlist \u2013 is the bestselling title of the six, however, with 9,541 copies sold to date, according to the Bookseller, narrowly ahead of The Promise\u2019s 8,844. Nadifa Mohamed, the sole British writer to make this year\u2019s Booker shortlist, is at 8/1 at Ladbrokes for The Fortune Men, inspired by the real-life story of a Somali seaman wrongfully convicted of murder in Wales. Sri Lankan Anuk Arudpragasam\u2019s A Passage North, in which a man travels across the island for the funeral of his grandmother\u2019s former care-giver, is at 14/1. At internet betting exchange Smarkets, Matthew Shaddick said it would be \u201cthe biggest Booker shock of recent years\u201d if Arudpragasam were to take the prize. \u201cThe betting markets hadn\u2019t had a very good record of predicting the winner until a few years ago, but the favourites have tended to do better recently; Douglas Stuart was the well-backed market leader last year as was Margaret Atwood in 2019 (albeit that ended up as a dead heat),\u201d said Shaddick. \u201cSince this year\u2019s shortlist was announced, Richard Powers has seen his chances improve the most, so I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see him win.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/02/damon-galgut-favourite-to-win-2021-booker-prize-the-promise", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:33:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Spin | Joe Root\u2019s legacy as player and captain may still depend on this Ashes", "article": "As anyone who has ever suffered from fear of flying knows, distraction is key. Anything to trick the brain into forgetting that you and it are hurtling through the ether in the cramped belly of a giant tin bird. Distraction. By any means possible. Booze might be the answer for some, the David Boon approach to air travel. Maybe you swear by that \u201cmake fists with your toes\u201d thing or try to take your mind off the turbulence and terrifying sounds by strapping some headphones on and endlessly repeating the frightened flyers\u2019 mantra about it being more likely you will perish after a chance encounter with a shark than through air travel. Or was it a vending machine?\nMore rational souls seek solace with thoughts of the destination, of exciting adventures in store. On the flip side, perhaps the relative sanctuary and safety of the aeroplane is far preferable to what awaits beyond the tarmac after touchdown. Joe Root probably isn\u2019t a twitchy flyer, \u201caerophobia\u201d being relatively incompatible with the globetrotting demands of an international cricketer. Nevertheless he could be forgiven for finding himself somewhere between the two states of mind when he boards the flight to Australia on Thursday. If there is a twinge of despair in the departure lounge or a wave of panic amid the clouds it could be because the next few weeks might well define his legacy as a batter and as a captain. To the bat first. Root has enjoyed a remarkable run of form in 2021. In 12 Test matches, beginning with Sri Lanka in January and India home and away since, he has swept, stroked, glanced, cut, driven, defended and dominated against searing pace and devilish spin. On Asian dustbowl and English green-top, under Chennai sun and Pennine cloud. Root has been an almost constant figure at the crease, runs flowing from his blade with surgeon-like precision; 1,455 of them at an average a tick over 66. His six centuries this calendar year include three double centuries, a 186 and a 180 not out. With the rest of England\u2019s top order quacking and creaking of late, Root\u2019s runs have been increasingly imperative. If England are to get even the pinkiest of fingers around the urn during five Test matches in Australia on deathly-dull drop-in batter-friendly pitches, Root surely has to pick up where he left off and extend his purple patch up to Christmas and beyond. But here\u2019s the rub. Root has never scored a century in Australia. In fact, as he cruises over the vast expanses on Friday, he will be unable to recall too many happy memories from his intended destination. Oz has been his bogey-land, he has an average of 38 in his nine Tests down under. While the lofty 30s might be a mere pipe dream for some of the top-order batters who have made the plane, that\u2019s a significant drop-off for Root whose career average after 109 Tests is north of 50. He has made no secret of his desperation to put this record straight.\nRoot has also pointed to the pain of being dropped for the 2014 Sydney Test after a quiet tour in which he occasionally looked cowed at the crease. To be fair, in that series the half-man-half-velociraptor Mitchell Johnson was ravaging his way through England\u2019s batting lineup repeatedly, making even the most seasoned players yearn for the departure lounge. The memory of missing out in that game inspired Root to improve. \u201cCooky sat me down and said: \u2018It\u2019s a tough call but you are not going to play in this game.\u2019\u201d He opened up to fellow Sheffield Collegiate alumnus and England captain Michael Vaughan in 2015. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what I did for the next hour. I was gone. I was an empty vessel \u2026 but then I was absolutely spewing. I was so angry and gutted because I had not scored runs, not because I thought I deserved to play.\u201d\nFour years later, Sydney again, but a different type of spewing. A debilitating bout of viral gastroenteritis struck Root down. Now captain and with England battling to stay in the game \u2013 the urn long since relinquished \u2013 Root spent time hooked up to a drip at St Vincent\u2019s hospital up the road from the Sydney Cricket Ground. Although he briefly made it back to the ground and out into the middle, he was physically unable to continue. Forced to retire on 58 not out after nearly four hours of batting with a raging fever in temperatures topping 50 degrees. At the moment of defeat he was passed out on a bench in the dressing room. Jimmy Anderson had to stand in for his stricken captain to do the media postmortem. Despite this, when Root boards the plane to Queensland this week it might even be with a sigh of relief. At last, it is on. The prospect of Messrs Cummins, Hazelwood, Starc and Lyon \u2013 each in possession of their own fearful projectiles \u2013 lying in wait at the Gabba on 8 December \u2013 is far preferable to the uncertainty and speculation of the past few months.\nAt one stage there were rumblings that those with young families \u2013 Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, potentially even Root himself \u2013 would in effect be left with little choice but to rule themselves out of the tour due to the stringent quarantine regulations in place. The prospect of a cad\u2019s tour to Oz was briefly in the offing, a Sam Billings XI or suchlike. In the end, with the right assurances made and the pandemic in Australia headed finally in the right direction, not to mention millions of pounds worth of broadcasting money at stake, the 2021-22 Ashes were cleared for takeoff. Perhaps crucially, Root will also have Ben Stokes by his side. As last-minute upgrades go, that is surely one of the best. As England Test captain, off the field is where you increasingly earn your paycheck while your legacy is still determined by events on it. Root has been a popular, thoughtful and honest captain at a time when the global game has been navigating decidedly soupy skies. His players like and respect him hugely, while he doesn\u2019t quite attract the fawning and enjoy the free rein of Eoin Morgan. On paper he is England\u2019s most successful in the Test format, in terms of number of wins, despite a tendency on occasion to tactical naivety, resulting in a few chastening losses. If Root helms an Ashes victory overseas, a big if, then his legacy as a captain will begin to nudge towards his greatness as a batter. The journey begins here. Welcome to Flight Ashes 2021-22.

{"title": "Bosnia is in danger of breaking up, warns top international official", "article": "The international community\u2019s chief representative in Bosnia has warned that the country is in imminent danger of breaking apart, and there is a \u201cvery real\u201d prospect of a return to conflict. In a report to the UN seen by the Guardian, Christian Schmidt, the high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, said that if Serb separatists carry out their threat to recreate their own army, splitting the national armed forces in two, more international peacekeepers would have to be sent back in to stop the slide towards a new war. International peacekeeping duties in Bosnia are currently the task of a residual EU force (Eufor) that is 700 strong. Nato retains a formal toehold with a headquarters in Sarajevo. The year-long mandate for both is up for renewal this week at the UN security council, but Russia has threatened to block a resolution unless all references to the high representative are removed, potentially undermining Schmidt\u2019s authority as the overseer of the 1995 Dayton peace deal. In his first report since taking up the post in August, Schmidt, a former German government minister, warned that Bosnia was facing \u201cthe greatest existential threat of the postwar period\u201d. The Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, is threatening to pull out of state-level institutions, including the national army built up with international assistance over the past quarter century, and reconstitute a Serb force. On 14 October, Dodik said he would force the Bosnian army to withdraw from the Republika Srpska (the Serb half of Bosnia) by surrounding its barracks and that if the west tried to intervene militarily, he had \u201cfriends\u201d who had promised to support the Serb cause, a presumed reference to Serbia and Russia. Bosnian Serb police carried out \u201ccounter-terrorist\u201d exercises last month on Mount Jahorina, from where Serb forces bombarded Sarajevo throughout a 1992-95 siege. \u201cThis is tantamount to secession without proclaiming it,\u201d Schmidt wrote in a report delivered to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Friday. He said Dodik\u2019s actions \u201cendanger not only the peace and stability of the country and the region, but \u2013 if unanswered by the international community \u2013 could lead to the undoing of the [Dayton peace] agreement itself.\u201d The high representative said it was possible there would be clashes between Bosnian national law enforcement agencies and Bosnian Serb police. \u201cShould the armed force of BiH [Bosnia and Herzegovina] splinter into two or more armies, the level of international military presence would require reassessment,\u201d Schmidt warned. \u201cA lack of response to the current situation would endanger the [Dayton agreement], while instability in BiH would have wider regional implications,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospects for further division and conflict are very real.\u201d Schmidt\u2019s warnings were delivered as the UN security council was preparing its annual resolution renewing the peacekeeping mandate for Eufor and the Nato headquarters, with a vote as early as Wednesday. Moscow is threatening to block the resolution unless all references to the high representative are removed. The Kremlin opposed Schmidt\u2019s appointment by a Peace Implementation Council, an ad hoc multinational body set up to implement the Dayton peace agreement, and refuses to recognise his authority. \u201cI suspect what Russia really wants is to chip away at the authority of the high representative\u2019s office by stopping him briefing the council,\u201d said a diplomat close to the discussions. Kurt Bassuener, co-founder and senior associate of the Democratization Policy Council, a Berlin-based thinktank, said: \u201cIt sounds like the Americans, the Brits and the French have effectively agreed to really strip back the references to the high representative that were boilerplate, standard issue language in all the previous resolutions.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd while legally that doesn\u2019t undercut the high representative, politically it sure as hell does.\u201d Even if Eufor\u2019s mandate is renewed, there is little appetite in the EU to beef up the small force left in Bosnia. Some member states, particularly Hungary, are supportive of Dodik. \u201cI think he\u2019s willing to gamble on the possibility that, as improbable as it is, he can get away with it by essentially creating new facts on the ground rapidly and counting on the idea that confusion and delay would grip both Sarajevo and the international community and there would ultimately be no meaningful international consequences,\u201d Jasmin Mujanovi\u0107, a Bosnian political scientist, said. US deputy assistant secretary of state Gabriel Escobar told Congress last week that the US is working with the EU to \u201cmake sure there are consequences for any illegal or any destabilising actions\u201d in Bosnia. But it is unclear whether the Biden administration would support a return to Nato peacekeeping. Alida Vra\u010di\u0107, the head of a Bosnia-based thinktank, Populari, said the perpetual and worsening sense of crisis allows the country\u2019s leaders to disguise their failure to govern. \u201cDodik has gone ballistic, but collectively politicians hope to win points on this crisis and citizens are the only losers as expected,\u201d Vra\u010di\u0107 said. \u201cThis discussion comes in handy, as it derails all meaningful discussions like the fact that Sarajevo is choking in smog, that [the regional governments] embezzled money in the Covid-19 crisis, that the death toll in Sarajevo is worse than during the war, the fact that half of the country is living in poverty, that we have completed exactly zero reforms, that no laws have been discussed in the parliament for months.\u201d \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 2 November 2021.

{"title": "Halt smart motorway projects until safety upgrades are made, say MPs", "article": "The construction of smart motorways should be paused until promised safety improvements have been delivered and there is more evidence to assess the risks, MPs have urged. The cross-party transport select committee criticised as premature the decision by Grant Shapps in March 2020 to press ahead with the use of the controversial motorways in the face of mounting concern about their safety. While the government has maintained that smart motorways are as safe as conventional ones, MPs said at least five years of trial data covering all variants of smart motorway, which manage road speeds through electronic signs and do not have a hard shoulder, were needed. The report said the available evidence was \u201climited and volatile\u201d, and urged greater powers for the Office of Rail and Road to block new road schemes until it was satisfied of their safety.\nThe scale of measures needed to mitigate the risks from removing the hard shoulder on motorways had been underestimated, MPs said, and Highways England (the old name for National Highways) and the Department for Transport had failed to deliver promised safety upgrades. More emergency refuge areas should be retrofitted to existing all-lane running smart motorways to be never more than one mile apart, and every 0.75 miles where possible. The highway code should also be updated with instructions to drivers to create corridors to allow emergency services to reach the scene of incidents, according to the MPs. The report did not go as far some campaigners in calling for smart motorways to be scrapped, after a number of motorists who had broken down in a live lane and been hit by other vehicles were killed. However, it said that Shapps\u2019 so-called \u201cstock take\u201d and 18-point plan last year would not go far enough in addressing the risks. MPs also questioned Shapps\u2019 decision to end by 2025 the use of \u201cdynamic\u201d all-lane running, where the hard shoulder is sometimes used as a live traffic lane. They suggested that with clear, consistent use such motorways would be preferable, as they could retain the hard shoulder in quieter times. The committee chair, Huw Merriman, said as only 29 miles of all-lane running smart motorways had operated for over five years, it \u201cfeels too soon, and uncertain, to use this as an evidence base to remove the hard shoulder from swathes of our motorway network\u201d. He said the focus on upgrading safety by ministers was welcome, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been here before. We\u2019re not convinced that reinstating the hard shoulder on existing schemes is the answer, but the DfT must pause the rollout and take stock.\u201d The select committee in June 2016 called on the government to drop or pause the rollout of smart motorways, which have been seen as a comparatively cheap and easy way to increase capacity on the UK\u2019s major road networks. A report then concluded that the trade-off in safety was an \u201cunacceptable price to pay\u201d for all-lane running. Motoring organisations welcomed the latest report, which they said was pragmatic and endorsed their calls for measures to improve safety. Labour said it confirmed that ministers had wrongly pressed ahead in the face of overwhelming warning evidence. Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cWe know smart motorways in their current form, coupled with inadequate safety systems, are not fit for purpose and are putting lives at risk. Reinstating the hard shoulder while full investigations are carried out need not be costly \u2026 the government must finally listen.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the committee recognises that reinstating the hard shoulder on all all-lane running motorways could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury and that we\u2019re right to focus on upgrading their safety, as the secretary of state committed to doing when he became transport secretary.\u201d While \u201cimprovements have not always been made as quickly as they could have been in the past\u201d, Shapps had committed \u00a3500m on upgrades and the faster rollout of stopped vehicle detection technology, they added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/halt-smart-motorway-projects-until-safety-upgrades-are-made-say-mps", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:41:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Facebook strongly rejected the study in a statement, with a spokesman saying the analysis from CCDH \u201cuses a flawed methodology designed to mislead people about the scale of climate misinformation on Facebook\u201d. He added that the 700,000 interactions mentioned in the report on climate denial represent 0.3% of the over 200m interactions on public English-language climate change content from pages and public groups over the same time period. \u201cWe continue to combat climate misinformation by reducing the distribution of anything rated false or misleading by one of our factchecking partners and rejecting any ads that have been debunked,\u201d he said. Tuesday\u2019s study echoes past research on what has come to be known as the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d \u2013 a group of accounts responsible for the vast majority of Covid-19 misinformation circulating on social media. It underscores just how much of an impact a small number of widely read websites can have in the algorithm-driven Facebook ecosystem, said the US senator Sheldon Whitehouse. \u201cFacebook and other social media companies make money when they send users down rabbit holes of climate denial,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very dangerous business model for the future of the planet.\u201d In 2020, Facebook launched a Climate Change Science Center, which contains factual data from credible sources on the climate crisis to counteract the spread of misinformation on its platforms. It also adds informational labels to some posts about the climate crisis, which direct users to the center. A spokesman for Facebook said it received more than 100,000 visitors each day. That resource was previously targeted primarily at US users, but on Monday, the company announced it was expanding its Climate Change Science Center to more than 100 countries, labeling posts for the first time in Belgium, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan. But the study\u2019s authors are asking the social media platform to go much further. They called on Facebook to stop taking payment from the publications to promote their content and to label misinformation about the climate crisis on a larger number of posts. The study found that 92% of the most popular articles examined did not have a label about climate crisis misinformation. CCDH also called on Google to remove eight of the 10 publications using Google Ads to profit from their climate crisis denial content. The researchers determined those eight publications earned an estimated $3.6m through Google Ads in the last six months. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, argued that the \u201cbad faith misinformation\u201d pushed by the 10 websites is designed to undermine social media users\u2019 confidence in science. By not acting more forcefully, Ahmed said, \u201cbig tech is once again on the wrong side of science, truth and human progress.\u201d The deputy editor in chief of RT, which according to the CCDH study published articles on \u201cclimate alarmism\u201d condemning \u201cdoom-mongers\u201d who believed climate change was worsening and has been called \u201cone of the most important organizations in the global political economy of disinformation\u201d, told the Guardian that the publication \u201cconstantly raises concerns over environmental issues\u201d. RT would not \u201cdisregard the variety of views essential to a healthy public discourse on its effects\u201d, Anna Belkina said. Other websites named in the study did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/02/super-polluters-the-top-10-publishers-denying-the-climate-crisis-on-facebook", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:09:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Home Office yet to provide funding for Afghan evacuees, say councils", "article": "Local authorities providing support to thousands of Afghan evacuees are yet to receive any funding from the Home Office to do so, the Guardian has learned. Councils looking after those evacuated from Afghanistan this summer say they are struggling to cope as hundreds of thousands of pounds promised to them by the government has not yet materialised. The Home Office has pledged to provide councils with \u00a328 a person a day to provide essential support to Afghan families in hotels. But a government source told the Guardian: \u201cLocal authorities will be offered \u00a328 per person per day to provide support to the guests. This will be backdated and we will be working with local authorities on how it can be claimed in due course.\u201d Georgia Gould, the chair of London Councils, said: \u201cLondon boroughs have stepped up to provide emergency support for hundreds of Afghan families evacuated during the summer. Despite promises from the Home Office, councils are yet to receive any funding to cover the cost of clothing, medical supplies or the hiring of support staff to help evacuees with basic needs. \u201cWe are urgently seeking reassurance from government that boroughs will receive this funding and that it will be extended to British nationals who have so far been excluded from this offer, which is unacceptable.\u201d\nThe news comes after reports that the Home Office\u2019s debit cards, known as Aspen cards, failed to activate, leaving new arrivals from Afghanistan with no cash. The Refugee Council said it was making payments of \u00a37-8,000 a week in emergency cash to refugees. Many people airlifted to safety from Afghanistan this summer are still unclear about their immigration status and not everyone has been told for which resettlement scheme they qualify and whether they are eligible for family reunion. London Councils told the Guardian it had received 221 homelessness applications from Afghans who do not qualify for resettlement support when they leave the hotel accommodation they were placed in when they arrived. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s alarming that families with large numbers of vulnerable children, many of whom are very traumatised, are having to live in hotels without the support they need and without any money of their own. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that every family is given the warm welcome the government has promised so that it becomes a reality rather than just an aspiration. Government needs to step up its efforts by creating across Whitehall taskforce to make this happen.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe emergency evacuation of Afghanistan was the biggest and fastest in our country\u2019s recent history. It helped over 15,000 people, including those who served alongside our armed forces, to safety in the United Kingdom. The government is working at pace to secure permanent housing for families and we would urge all local authorities to do their upmost to help support these vulnerable people.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/home-office-yet-to-provide-funding-for-afghan-evacuees-say-councils", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:38:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ending the AIDS epidemic: challenging the stigma in eastern Europe and central Asia", "article": "Tony, a gender-fluid social worker, knows they have two battles to face if they want to change public attitudes towards HIV and the transgender community in their home country of Georgia. An acutely marginalised group, it was only in March this year that the first trans person in the country had their gender status legally recognised by the courts. Tony identifies prejudice and stigma as constant barriers for trans people trying to access healthcare. \u201cTransphobia can jeopardise people\u2019s sexual health, or may lead to poor treatment adherence if they already have HIV,\u201d says Tony, who is also executive director of the trans advocacy group Temida in Tbilisi. \u201cThey may be less likely to get tested and to receive medication.\u201d Raising awareness of these issues is crucial to reducing stigma and improving the health and wellbeing of trans people and other communities most affected by HIV. Tony is one of a diverse group of HIV community leaders from across eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA) who are telling their stories as part of Radian Changemakers, an effort to raise awareness of HIV in the region and the devastating effects of stigma around the virus. Both AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections have continued to rise in EECA despite numbers falling in other global regions. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), EECA is \u201cfailing to control its HIV epidemic\u201d. The annual number of new HIV infections increased by 43% between 2010 and 2020, making EECA \u201cthe fastest growing HIV epidemic in the world\u201d and one of two regions in the world where new HIV infections rose in that period. In the Middle East and north Africa, new infections increased by 7%.\nRadian is a groundbreaking partnership between the Elton John AIDS Foundation and pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which aims to help reduce HIV infections and to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030 in EECA. According to UNAIDS, deaths from AIDS-related illnesses have risen by 32% in the past 10 years and now account for nearly 100 deaths a day in EECA. More than 380 people are newly diagnosed with HIV every day, adding to the 1.6 million people already estimated to be living with the virus in the region. The Radian partnership has two arms. The Unmet Need fund supports individual grassroots organisations devoted to HIV prevention and care, while its Model Cities programme provides significant funding to improve access to lifesaving HIV services in key EECA cities and regions to reduce new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, as examples for other cities and regions in EECA seeking to end their own HIV epidemic. Almaty in Kazakhstan is Radian\u2019s first model city.\nCommunity Friends is the primary organisation addressing HIV among Almaty\u2019s LGBTQ+ community, and one of the first organisations to receive support from Radian. Founded by Svyatoslav Suslov, it works directly with the city\u2019s trans community and men who have sex with men (MSM). \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that while on average the whole world is recording a downward curve in new [HIV] cases, here we have an increase in infections,\u201d says Suslov. However, the work of Community Friends is already having an impact. It provides practical support including HIV tests, access to prevention programmes and peer support groups for MSM and trans people. But crucially it is also helping to reduce the stigma associated with HIV. Suslov says: \u201cThere are more people who have begun to talk openly about the fact that they have been living with HIV for many years.\u201d In another part of the city, Lyubov, who was diagnosed with HIV 17 years ago, advocates for the rights of people living with HIV. Her organisation, supported by Radian, runs HIV awareness training for healthcare staff to help reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with a positive diagnosis. Lyubov says her work has taught her to be more compassionate towards those who discriminate against people with HIV. \u201cYou can\u2019t just force change on people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to understand the people discriminating are human beings, and that they need help to understand that HIV is not scary. This experience stays in my memory as it changed how I work.\u201d\nApproximately 1,500 miles away in Yekaterinburg in Russia, Vera knows first-hand what it really means to live with HIV. Diagnosed 20 years ago, she knew she had to take action when she realised that increasing numbers of her friends and family were dying from the virus. \u201cI felt I had no choice,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised that I was already deeply affected by the disaster, so I had to do something about it.\u201d Vera\u2019s organisation has recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary as a registered charity, after starting as a local peer support group and patient information centre for people living with or at risk of HIV \u2013 including sex workers, prisoners and people who use drugs.\nToday, with help from Radian, the organisation is helping to save lives and providing support for grassroots organisations. Working in harmony with the government-backed local AIDS centre, it is connecting people who are receiving HIV treatment to lifesaving care. By providing individual and group counselling, organising outreach events and HIV prevention exhibitions, the organisation is leading efforts to address HIV and AIDS across the Sverdlovsk region. Radian hopes that by amplifying the voices of community leaders it can draw greater attention to the continuing HIV epidemic in the EECA region. Anne Aslett, chief executive officer of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, says: \u201cLocal innovations are key to tackling the unique issues of the AIDS epidemic in eastern Europe and central Asia. We are excited to shine a light on the remarkable work of local experts supported through our Radian partnership and the vital role they play in the HIV response.\u201d Alex Kalomparis, vice-president of international public affairs at Gilead Sciences, echoes her praise, heralding the changemakers as \u201cthe people who are leaders in ending this epidemic\u201d.

{"title": "\u2018It\u2019s important to be visible\u2019: meet two women living with HIV in eastern Europe and central Asia", "article": "For many people, an HIV diagnosis is frightening and isolating, leaving them to wonder what their future holds. For Vera, who discovered she had HIV in 2001 at the age of 23, the diagnosis was a catalyst to act, changing the trajectory of her life for ever. \u201cAll my activities probably stem, in one way or another, from the fact that I am living with HIV. Now I am surrounded by people who are active in this sphere,\u201d she says. Vera leads an organisation that provides community-based services for people affected by HIV. Radian, a joint initiative of the Elton John AIDS Foundation and pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, supports organisations such as Vera\u2019s to address the burgeoning HIV/AIDS epidemic in eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA). Contrary to global trends, deaths from AIDS-related illnesses have increased by around 32% in the past 10 years in EECA, and an estimated 1.6 million people are living with HIV in the region.\nPart of the problem is that there is still significant stigma attached to living with HIV, which discourages people from accessing necessary treatment and care, leading to poorer health and increased HIV transmission. A report by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) shows that an estimated 53% of people living with HIV in EECA are receiving treatment compared with 73% globally. To help address this issue, Radian will support targeted interventions in up to 25 countries in EECA over the next five years, working with a number of grassroots organisations. Vera\u2019s is one of them. After she saw the need for support services for people like herself, Vera began running groups and patient information meetings to help people living with HIV in 2010. Support from Radian is helping Vera and her organisation to contribute to Russia\u2019s national strategy goal to connect people living with HIV to lifesaving care and treatment and to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030. Vera is working with her local AIDS centre to implement mobile search teams to bring people living with HIV back into care so they can receive treatment. Despite living in an area with a high prevalence of HIV, Vera is optimistic that they can bring about change. \u201cEvery life matters,\u201d she says. Access to treatment and care is critical in reducing new cases of HIV and ending AIDS. When people living with HIV are on treatment, not only are their health outcomes improved, but it\u2019s impossible to transmit the virus. Radian hopes to help tackle the issue through its Model Cities programme and the Unmet Need fund, which aim to expand access to lifesaving services and help end the HIV epidemic in key EECA cities. Globally, young women aged 15 to 24 are twice as likely to be living with HIV than young men, according to UNAIDS. In EECA, women account for a rising proportion of people living with HIV.\nLyubov, a 36-year-old mother from Kazakhstan, has lived with HIV for 17 years. She has directly experienced how HIV impacts women\u2019s health, safety and wellbeing. Lyubov started campaigning after trying to help a domestic abuse victim who was turned away from her local crisis centre when staff discovered she had HIV. \u201cI called the head of the crisis centre and told her if they didn\u2019t accept this woman, we would be filing a lawsuit against them for discrimination, and then of course they said: \u2018OK\u2019,\u201d she says. The following day, Lyubov went back to the crisis centre to deliver HIV training to help staff understand more about HIV transmission, stigma and discrimination. HIV can cause specific health problems for women including issues with their menstrual cycle, early menopause and a higher risk of cervical cancer. Pregnant women, who are not on treatment, are more likely to pass on HIV to their unborn baby and women are also more likely to develop heart problems if they have HIV. Women are already more likely to experience social and economic inequality than men, and more than half (52%) of women from EECA have experienced physical abuse after being diagnosed with HIV, a 2019 study by the Eurasian Women\u2019s Network on AIDS (EWNA) shows. Lyubov hopes her organisation, which provides information and anti-discrimination training to staff in healthcare institutions and shelter homes for homeless women, will continue to help overcome the stigma that still surrounds HIV. \u201cUnfortunately, I am one of the few people who feels able to talk openly about my HIV status, but I think this can be extremely impactful when we are conducting training with doctors, police, and the community. It\u2019s important to be visible,\u201d she says. \u201cVera and Lyubov are inspirational. They\u2019ve turned their direct experience as women living with HIV into action,\u201d says Anne Aslett, chief executive officer of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. \u201cIt can be difficult to disclose your status, seek support or know where to turn, and these two champions are making HIV care more accessible and familiar to key populations, including women. We\u2019re proud that our Radian partnership can recognise Vera and Lyubov to continue their incredible work.\u201d Alex Kalomparis, vice-president of international public affairs at Gilead Sciences, says: \u201cIn the global efforts to end HIV and AIDS, we must acknowledge the importance of the stories of people living with HIV in order to challenge the stigma that perpetuates the epidemic. The personal stories of the Radian Changemakers, and the extraordinary work they do, show that lasting change is built by ordinary people recognising their own strength and leading this effort.\u201d If you would like to hear more about the Radian Changemakers or the Radian Model Cities programme, visit radianhiv.org Article 2 October 2021 | IHQ-UNB-0977", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/radian-changemakers/2021/nov/02/its-important-to-be-visible-meet-two-women-living-with-hiv-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:08:22Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Sudanese bankers stage \u2018revolutionary\u2019 strike after military coup", "article": "Sudan has been hit by a severe cash shortage as most banks and cash machines remain closed one week after a military coup prompted a nationwide strike by bankers. About 90% of bankers were taking part in a civil disobedience campaign, said Ibrahim Abdel-Raheem, who works at the Workers National Bank in Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum. \u201cWe knew that going on strike as bankers would cripple the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks are the backbone of the economy.\u201d The Sudanese Bankers Association has said it will stage protests in front of banks across the country on Tuesday and Thursday in a \u201crevolutionary escalation\u201d of its campaign. Abdel-Raheem said the action has affected him personally. \u201cI had to give up many things,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have one pound in my pocket. I am only buying the very basic things, because I have no cash.\u201d Yassir Binawai, a 46-year-old who works in the mining industry in northern Sudan, said that he had to borrow money from his employer\u2019s canteen to buy food. \u201cIt\u2019s been so difficult to manage with the cash shortage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will not give up despite all the struggles.\u201d Cash still dominates the Sudanese economy due to a lack of ATM infrastructure. Western Union suspended its operations last week, making access to money harder. Salah Mamoun, from Omdurman, said he relied on friends who worked in the money exchange industry to get hold of cash. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in the market,\u201d he said. Commodity prices have fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, making financial planning hard for ordinary people. A shop owner in Khartoum who declined to give his name said he had been forced to borrow money from a neighbour and that his family was struggling. \u201cThere\u2019s a recession, nobody buys things from our shop\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife has money in her bank account [but] withdrawing it is an issue because the ATMs are empty.\u201d On 25 October, Sudan\u2019s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the cabinet as well as the ruling joint military-civilian Sovereign Council, which had been heading Sudan\u2019s transition towards full civilian rule after the 2019 overthrow of the autocratic president Omar al-Bashir. In a move widely condemned internationally, Burhan declared a state of emergency and detained Sudan\u2019s civilian leadership, including the prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, and members of his government. The US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived in Khartoum on Tuesday to try to defuse the crisis. Feltman accused Burhan of acting in bad faith by staging the coup hours after holding face-to-face discussions with him in Khartoum, in which he gave no hint of his plan to seize power. The US has paused $700m in debt relief and aid and urged potential allies of the Sudanese military \u2013 Russia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 not to back the coup. \u201cWe are in with a number of nations, including the UAE, to restore the civilian [government] in Sudan,\u201d Feltman said. Feltman urged the military to restore the ousted civilian government, release all prisoners including Hamdok, who is currently under house arrest, as well as to allow medical assistance to reach injured demonstrators without interference. \u201cTo the freedom-loving Sudanese and to those who would seek to rob them of their democratic ambitions, I say: \u2018The world is watching and the Sudanese people have made it clear they will not accept a military attempt to sideline their hard fought democratic transition.\u2019\u201d Feltman also questioned Burhan\u2019s bona fides. \u201cFor all his statements supporting the constitutional declaration of 2019 and their desire for elections, his actions have done the opposite, undermined the civilian military partnership and hijacked the type of transition that the military and civilians had agreed,\u201d he said.

{"title": "\u2018They\u2019re not cookie-cutter\u2019: dressing the black cowboys of The Harder They Fall", "article": "Researching outfits for the Netflix western The Harder They Fall, the costume designer Antoinette Messam got a history lesson in the process. The film\u2019s story is fictional, but it draws on the real-life black cowboys of the west, including Nat Love, Bill Pickett, Rufus Buck and characters such as Stagecoach Mary, who delivered mail across the US, protecting it from bandits with a shotgun. It is now thought that one in four cowboys were black, but this reality has been whitewashed from history. \u201cI literally had to buy this book, The Black West,\u201d says Messam. It contained images of these people for her to pore over. \u201cThey all had their own individual style,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, when it came to my cast, it was really, really important that I differentiate everyone so they\u2019re not a cookie-cutter, stereotypical cowboy, you know?\u201d\nDirected by Jeymes Samuel and produced by Jay-Z, the film features Regina King, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Lakeith Stanfield, Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors. Their costumes showcase Messam\u2019s research skills. Love, played by Majors, wears jeans. Messam says the original appeal was the indigo colour, \u201cbut I when I started doing my research, I was shocked to know that denim as I show it existed far before my timeline, from the 1850s. I was like: \u2018My shit is accurate, you guys.\u2019\u201d Stagecoach Mary, played by Beetz, is reimagined as a former gang member who owns saloons. She wears a corseted dress that multitasks. \u201cWhen we first see her, it\u2019s important to show her in the attire of a saloon,\u201d says Messam. \u201cThen, when we see her again, she\u2019s dressed to go out on the plains \u2026 her dress is split, so that she can straddle a horse, not sit side-saddle, which was common at the time.\u201d\nDetails like this are crucial for Messam. Most viewers will notice King\u2019s frilled blouse, Stanfield\u2019s neckerchief or Elba\u2019s red velvet jacket, but look closer and you will see the different cultural influences that people such as Love and Buck would have absorbed. \u201cIt was important for me to use references from all over the world,\u201d says Messam. \u201cSpanish references, Mexican references, indigenous references. Mary wears a lot of silver and turquoise, and they were influenced by the vaqueros, Mexican cowboys.\u201d Cuffee, played by Danielle Deadwyler, is a gender-non-conforming character who provides the muscle on the door of Stagecoach Mary\u2019s saloon. \u201cIn doing my research and coming across a woman who dressed non-binary, as we would call it now, it looked to me like it was mostly for practical reasons,\u201d says Messam. Cuffee is clearly more comfortable in a man\u2019s suit than a skirt. \u201cTo be taken seriously, that\u2019s what worked for her,\u201d says Messam. \u201cIf she was going to knock somebody out, it was better that she was wearing pants and a jacket.\u201d While modern viewers might assume that the clothing in The Harder They Fall would conform to gender norms, Messam says the era was more varied in reality \u2013 especially in the wild west. This is evident in her costumes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see some of them in the saloon, but there was a woman in hats and pants alongside the ladies of the night,\u201d she says.\nThe Harder They Fall comes out at a time when western style is enjoying a moment, with black Americans in the public eye showcasing the look. At the film\u2019s premiere, Taraji P Henson wore a stetson, while others donned cowboy boots. This follows Beyonc\u00e9 in chaps, Lil Nas X in a cowboy hat and the Yee-Haw Agenda, a website and Instagram account that works as an archive of imagery. Is this about rediscovering style heritage lost to history? \u201cWell, there\u2019s that \u2013 and there\u2019s also the fact that people are becoming aware of the cowboy culture that exists now,\u201d Messam says. She references Elba\u2019s film, Concrete Cowboy, which is based on a real-life black cowboy community in Philadelphia, and a community she visited in California. \u201cDoing this film, they brought in cowboys from across the country to ride the horses,\u201d she says. \u201cI got to know some of them. They\u2019re so cool.\u201d The Harder They Fall is on Netflix from 3 November", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/nov/02/theyre-not-cookie-cutter-dressing-the-black-cowboys-of-the-harder-they-fall", "last_update": "2021-11-02T10:34:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "THG shares plunge to record low as BlackRock halves stake", "article": "Shares in the Hut Group hit an all-time low on Tuesday after it emerged that BlackRock was halving its stake in the online retailer after a rocky month for the company. BlackRock, its largest institutional shareholder, is selling 58m shares priced at 195p each, or a 10.3% discount to the stock\u2019s Monday close, according to bookrunner Goldman Sachs. The deal is valued at \u00a3113.1m. The world\u2019s biggest fund manager had a 10.1% stake, or nearly 124m shares, in mid-October according to Refinitiv data. Shares in the Manchester-based THG, which runs websites including Lookfantastic and Cult Beauty, fell 9% to a record low of 197p on Tuesday, far below the flotation price of 500p in September 2020.\nThe shares soared to nearly 800p at the start of the year but have slumped in recent months because of concerns about the firm\u2019s governance and the future of the business, after it flagged last week that profit margins would be squeezed by currency changes. Analysts have also pointed to a slowdown in growth at its core beauty division. \u201cFor a while THG was a stock market darling with investors clambering to own the stock in the belief it would play a key role in helping product manufacturers sell direct to consumers. Now it is losing fans at an incredibly rapid rate,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell. \u201cAsset managers rarely sell after a stock has already fallen so much unless they\u2019ve lost all confidence in the business and/or found something that completely changes the investment case. The backlash against THG seems to centre on the fact that people bought into the hype without paying attention to valuation. \u201cNow that difficult questions are being asked about costs and more, particularly if the business is broken up into three as per the suggestion from THG, investors aren\u2019t getting the answers they want \u2013 or they are not liking what they see.\u201d\nThe company, which is run by its co-founder and biggest shareholder, Matt Moulding, has tried to calm investor nerves by hiring the headhunter Russell Reynolds to search for a new non-executive chair.

{"title": "The US Senate is undemocratic. That\u2019s bleak for Democrats\u2019 midterm hopes | David Daley", "article": "Think Democrats have it tough now, trying to keep a precarious US Senate majority in tune on a trillion-dollar-plus budget reconciliation package without a single vote to spare? Just wait. These days of 50 Democratic senators may soon look like glory days.\nDemocrats are staring down an ugly reality in the US Senate: the historical malapportionment of the upper chamber, which awards two members to every state, even though Wyoming\u2019s population is not only 68 times smaller than California\u2019s but smaller than 115 counties nationwide, already places the party at a disadvantage. This edge has only become more prominent due to polarization and population patterns, and will collide next with a challenging map in 2022 and an even harder one in 2024. It\u2019s a problem so intractable that it makes even partisan gerrymandering seem like child\u2019s play. Demographic change won\u2019t help, either. Democrats are simply packed into fewer states. According to a 2020 Data for Progress study, that hands Republicans a three-percentage-point advantage. The nation has grown more multiracial and less white, according to 2020 census data, a trend which should, on balance, favor Democrats. But while the \u201cemerging Democratic majority\u201d is happening on paper, it has been structurally blocked from achieving political power. The white, non-college-educated voters that make up the largest part of the Republican coalition are shrinking in numbers nationwide, but they\u2019re better distributed; those rural and less-educated voters still hold a dominant position in enough small states to claim a decisive grip over the Senate. Maybe 130,000 New York hipsters can be persuaded to move from Jackson Heights, Queens, to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It might be the best investment any liberal billionaire could make, since this is a political problem for Democrats but also a crisis for democracy without any easy solutions. The political analyst and pollster David Shor suggests that even if Democrats deliver \u201ca startling performance\u201d in 2022, defeat Republicans by four percentage points and surmount the losses that a governing party historically faces in the midterms, \u201cthey have about a 50-50 chance of holding the majority\u201d. Win a more slender majority, says Shor \u2013 say 51% \u2013 and \u201cthey\u2019ll likely lose a seat \u2013 and the Senate\u201d. This isn\u2019t a new development, of course: the structure of the Senate has been inegalitarian since our founding, and the nation\u2019s political geography has provided the Republican party with a baked-in edge for decades. But contemporary partisan trends have exacerbated it. The Republican party held the US Senate between 1994 and 2006, and again from 2014 through 2020. However, according to research by Stephen Wolf of Daily Kos, Republican senators actually represented a majority of Americans during just one electoral cycle over those decades, in 1996-97. (Right now, the 50 Democratic senators represent 41 million more Americans than the 50 Republicans.) Wolf added up every vote cast for Democratic and Republican Senate candidates over this period, and calculated the total over every six-year period in order to determine which party had more support over the period of any given Senate term. Only during a small window over those three decades \u2013 covering Senate elections from 1994 through 1998 \u2013 did Republicans ever capture that three-cycle aggregate vote representing every ballot cast for all 100 senators. The trendline for Democrats does not look to be improving. The 2020 census showed that more than half of the 330 million Americans live in just nine states. That means upwards of 50% of us have 18 US senators, while the smaller half has the other 82. (By 2040, according to a University of Virginia forecast, half of the nation could live in only eight states, with just 16 senators.) Let\u2019s break that down even further. Two-thirds of all Americans \u2013 some 219,073,534 of us, to be exact \u2013 live in the largest 15 states, according to census data. They\u2019re represented by 30 senators \u2013 22 Democrats and eight Republicans. The other third? They have 70 senators. These smaller states aren\u2019t only whiter than the nation at large, they tilt decisively to the Republican party, represented by 42 Republicans and 28 Democrats. That\u2019s more than enough to filibuster any legislation that cannot be passed through the reconciliation process \u2013 including voting rights \u2013 effectively granting veto power over even popular proposals to a tiny minority of voters from the smallest and whitest states. (As the Maine senator Angus King noted on the Senate floor last week, 41 senators representing just 24% of Americans can block legislation with the filibuster.) The Democrats\u2019 future looks even bleaker when you graft that geographic reality on to a deeply polarized nation with more red-leaning states than blue, and voters increasingly less likely to split their ballots between a presidential candidate of one party and a US Senate hopeful from another. The Senate has become as sorted as the rest of the nation. Should the Senate represent states, or the American people? Should one-third of the nation retain the power to block legislation favored by large majorities? What does it mean to hold the consent of the governed when Democratic candidates for the US Senate \u2013 but also the US House and the White House \u2013 must win by large majorities to have a chance at holding more seats or electors, but Republicans can capture both chambers with fewer votes? In a moment in which we are focused on racial equity, how can we hand bonus representation to smaller, whiter states, ensuring that the Senate leans toward the interest of white voters on any issue where whites and communities of color diverge? And what does it hold for the legitimacy of the supreme court when five of nine conservatives have been selected by presidents that lost the popular vote, then confirmed by senators that represent a minority of Americans? There is no equality in a system so wildly malapportioned. A Congress designed 240 years ago to guard against a tyranny of the majority now ensures that a white majority in a changing nation maintains veto power simply by virtue of the smaller states where they live. Perhaps that has been the point of the Senate from the beginning. More than 25 years ago, in 1995, the former senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed that \u201csometime in the next century, the United States is going to have to address the question of apportionment in the Senate.\u201d We\u2019ve arrived at that moment. Now what? One solution would require Republicans conceding their advantage in the interest of representational fairness and broadening their appeal to voters in a multiracial nation. The other requires Democrats to broaden their appeal and win elections in states turning decisively the other direction, then using that power to add states or make otherwise bold reform. At this moment, as Republicans cement an enduring minority rule through gerrymandering, geography and the courts, and Democrats appear unable or unwilling to muster any meaningful response, both options feel equally unlikely.

{"title": "Take it from an Irish woman: if US abortion rights keep slipping, dark days are coming | Maeve Higgins", "article": "I am a woman in America who can bear children, and this means that there are powerful people coming for me, with detailed and strategic plans to control my body. Sounds dramatic, doesn\u2019t it? It is dramatic, more so because it\u2019s a straight-up fact. In 2021, state legislatures enacted more abortion restrictions than in any previous year, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy body dedicated to advancing reproductive rights. Last month\u2019s decision by the supreme court to refuse to block a Texas law all but banning abortion signals that the court could well be on the way to overturn Roe v Wade, and soon. National legalized abortion is just one part of this. Reproductive justice advocates as far back as 1994 understood that when women don\u2019t have access to abortion it generally means that we don\u2019t have access to a whole host of other rights: affordable contraceptives, comprehensive sex education, pre-natal care, even screening and treatment for a variety of diseases including cancer and HIV. This is an overall form of oppression, and I know what\u2019s happening. I also fear I know what\u2019s coming. I live in New York City, I am financially stable and I am white. These factors, as well as legal protections in New York, mean that I get to live a life free from coercion, with access to contraception, to reproductive healthcare, to a medical abortion if I need one. I don\u2019t take this for granted, because this reality is worlds away from where I grew up \u2013 in Ireland, a country that only legalised abortion in 2018. Here in the US, back in 1973, the supreme court affirmed the legality of a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion under the 14th amendment to the constitution. Living in this far from perfect nation, I still have the right to make choices about my own health and future, meaning a life with more dignity and autonomy than I had growing up, and that is an extraordinary thing. But even if I don\u2019t yet feel it, the threat of losing this hard-won freedom is all around me. In the words of Alexis McGill Johnson, president and chief executive of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, \u201cThe moment is dark \u2026 No matter where you live, no matter where you are, this fight is at your doorstep right now.\u201d McGill Johnson was speaking on 2 October, as women across the country organized through the Women\u2019s March protested against the US supreme court\u2019s refusal to block the Texas legislation. Talk about being up against it: Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices, meaning that the court now has an anti-abortion majority and reproductive justice hangs in the balance. That is why on 4 October, Emma Whittman, a 22-year-old public health student from Arizona sat in the road, blocking traffic outside the supreme court in Washington DC. She was arrested for civil disobedience.\n\u201cI\u2019m not from Texas, but I feel like I\u2019m fighting for people in Texas,\u201d she told me, as well as people \u201cin all of these other states that will probably get abortion bans, and will be impacted when Roe v Wade is overturned. I feel like I\u2019m fighting for all women around the country.\u201d It was Whittman\u2019s first arrest and the experience of being searched and held by the police was scary. Concerns about how an arrest and a potential criminal record may affect her future career worried her too. But Whittman was not alone. Her mother, an OB/GYN from Tucson, was there too, reassuring her daughter as she was zip-tied, telling her that she loved her and was proud of her. Women take care of each other. We always have. In Ireland, in the darkest and most oppressive times, when our reproductive rights and our health were out of our hands, we did what we could to make each other safe. In 1980 Irish women could not get condoms, divorce was illegal and abortion was shameful, illegal and dangerous. In 2018, after a compassionate but fierce campaign, almost two of every three Irish people voted to legalize abortion. Today in the US, the moment is indeed dark, and there are darker times ahead. Women, as ever, are fighting against that. Professor Terry McGovern, chair of the department of population and family health at the Columbia University medical center, was also arrested outside the supreme court that day. She points out that Texas already has a severe maternal mortality crisis with a disproportionate effect on Black women. \u201cThey\u2019re not taking care of women and children,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey have the worst health outcomes. And then they\u2019re focusing on restricting women and girls and people\u2019s bodily autonomy?\u201d That is why she showed up on the steps of the supreme court, and that is why she will continue to fight. \u201cIt has absolutely always been true in history that when a law is as thoroughly amoral as this one, and it will be when they overturn Roe, that we have to do whatever we need to do to protect people\u2019s health.\u201d Maeve Higgins is a comedian and the author of Maeve in America: Essays by a Girl from Somewhere Else", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/take-it-from-an-irish-woman-if-us-abortion-rights-keep-slipping-dark-days-are-coming", "last_update": "2021-10-29T17:05:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Plymouth on track for Championship 10 years after their darkest hour | Ben Fisher", "article": "It is Thursday morning at Home Park and, as the Plymouth manager Ryan Lowe says, there is no time to waste. Training starts across the way in nine minutes. His squad are preparing to face Ipswich before a bumper crowd of 16,087, their biggest for a league game since 2008. Perched above a tree-lined slope the performance analyst, Jimmy Dickinson, is filming the session. The pitches, spread over two tiers, are immaculate \u2013 perfect for their slick style \u2013 and the ball zips across the surface during a passing drill. Then comes some unit work, while rainbow-coloured corner flags flutter in the breeze. Lowe, a former Shrewsbury and Bury striker, moonlights as a defender as he takes the forwards for a shooting exercise while his assistant, Steven Schumacher, takes the midfielders. Adam Randell, a 21-year-old academy graduate, is practising pinging balls forward from a pivot position, until now home to the suspended Jordan Houghton. Two days later Randell is man of the match on his full league debut as Plymouth win to stay top of League One and extend their unbeaten streak to 15 league matches.\nThe Pilgrims are not getting carried away but their progress is impossible to ignore. Eight years ago they avoided relegation to non-league on the final day and they finished 18th in the third tier last season. They have revamped their defence \u2013 only Swindon and Oldham conceded more goals in the top four tiers last season \u2013 and grown wedded to an attacking 3-5-2. \u201cWe try and play the formation no matter who we are playing against,\u201d says the defender James Wilson, one of 10 summer signings. Recruitment is key. Plymouth work with Mrkt Insights, a data analytics company, to identify potential signings. \u201cI liaise with them pretty much on a day-to-day basis,\u201d says the director of football, Neil Dewsnip, pointing out they still have \u201cfoot soldiers\u201d taking in games. \u201cThe data is a support mechanism \u2013 it is not the holy grail. The signoff is still very much at the end of a discussion between myself, Ryan and Andrew Parkinson, the CEO.\u201d Dewsnip, who previously worked with England and Everton, has known Schumacher since the age of eight. \u201cI was his first coach at Everton,\u201d he says. \u201cI was still a PE teacher in those days and he came to my school as well, so he got it both barrels. He\u2019d always said: \u2018When I start to coach, would you help me, would you mentor me?\u2019 We\u2019re living that, really.\u201d\nIt explains why Schumacher and Lowe refer to Dewsnip, who also counts Steven Gerrard and the Oxford manager, Karl Robinson, among his former pupils, as \u201cMr D\u201d. \u201cI think Steven is still a little bit apprehensive about calling me by my first name because I would have challenged him as a young player over the years,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cIt is a term of endearment, I think.\u201d Dewsnip\u2019s contacts have enabled him to organise Zoom calls between Plymouth\u2019s coaching staff and Gareth Southgate, Steve Holland and Anthony Barry, Chelsea\u2019s first-team coach. Lowe, meanwhile, counts Gerrard as a longtime friend. Dewsnip, who is based in Cheshire, sometimes crashes at Lowe\u2019s apartment in Plymouth and speaks with the manager \u201chourly, I think\u201d. The day before a game, Dewsnip is on the grass at training. \u201cMost technical directors or sporting directors are doing it from a recruitment point of view. I\u2019m not so sure there is anybody else in my role that actually gets on the field and supports the manager and assistant manager in terms of the gameplan, the discussions we have about how to win games and so on.\u201d\nLast weekend marked a decade since the club came out of administration and a handful of staff remain, including the kit manager, Neil Lunnon. Over the years Lunnon has seen various superstitions, including a striker who bought a pair of boots every time he went a couple of games without scoring, and a midfielder who requested Lunnon lug a pot of black pepper with him home and away. \u201cEvery game I would sprinkle it into his boots,\u201d Lunnon says. The bloody noses Plymouth have given Sheffield Wednesday, whom they face in the FA Cup first round on Sunday, and Ipswich are even more impressive given they are working with a bottom-half budget. Sustainability is not just a buzzword at Argyle, who \u2013 with the caveats of receiving a \u00a32.5m business interruption insurance payout in case of \u201ccommunicable disease\u201d and government support via the furlough scheme \u2013 posted a \u00a3376,000 profit despite playing almost all of last season behind closed doors. \u201cYou have clubs who chase the dream and probably overstep that and on the other hand you go to a situation where if you don\u2019t spend the right amount of money, are you really competitive?\u201d Parkinson says. \u201cThe answer is somewhere in the middle. We\u2019re doing well on the pitch and off it.\u201d\nPlymouth were one of the first clubs to hand use of their stadium to the NHS at the beginning of the pandemic and although the Captain\u2019s Lounge in the revamped Mayflower Stand is still a vaccine centre, these days the main reason supporters are coming in their droves is to drink in what is happening on the field. A decade on from those struggles at the foot of League Two, those dark days are a distant memory. \u201cThe club is well structured, we\u2019re in a better financial position,\u201d Lowe smiles. \u201cIt is run better than it ever has been \u2013 and the football\u2019s going OK as well.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2021/nov/02/plymouth-on-track-for-championship-10-years-after-their-darkest-hour", "last_update": "2021-11-02T11:43:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": " Five of the best podcasts: sleep-inducing sounds and stories", "article": "Headspace Sleepcasts The recent boom in \u201csleep podcasts\u201d encompasses a range of aims: some provide short-term relief each night, while others help build a bedtime routine. The Headspace app, which aims to make mindfulness techniques habitual through bite-size lessons, extends that mission into the bedroom with its Sleepcasts. The 45- to 55-minute \u201caudio journey\u201d begins with a meditation or breathing exercise to wind down, before sending you to sleep with an audio tour through a soothing scene. In the episode I tried, it was a gallery where all the paintings were blue. The seven-part Headspace Guide to Sleep video series might strike a compromise for those struggling with the first rule of good sleep hygiene: no screens.\nSleep With Me Drew Ackerman came up with the concept for Sleep With Me after finding, at parties, that the people he was chatting to often seemed eager to excuse themselves to go to the bathroom. Having struggled with insomnia since childhood, and finding most \u201csleep solutions\u201d to be off-puttingly po-faced, Ackerman decided to use his talent for boring people to help them drift off. Now millions seek out his company, with Sleep With Me celebrating its eighth anniversary this month. Speaking as the affable, absentminded \u201cDearest Scooter\u201d (and after a short preamble, including ads), Ackerman tells a circular and confused story that you will never hear the end of. He is so good at what he does, he can even make Game of Thrones lower the pulse, recapping episodes in his spin-off pod Game of Drones.\nSlow Radio, BBC Radio 3 Finding out what works for you requires experimentation: one person\u2019s bedtime wind-down might be counterproductive for another, as evidenced by the large (one might say, perturbing) number of people who choose to drift off to violent stories of true crime. Even some designated sleep aids can be more unsettling than soothing (like Sleep Whispers, where a man mutters about baked trout or Stonehenge). If you find any words intrusive, BBC Radio 3\u2019s Slow Radio series creates soundscapes to lull you to sleep. Billed as an \u201cantidote to today\u2019s frenzied world\u201d, the 30-minute episodes combine music with field recordings from the natural world, from crashing waves to the crunch of gravel underfoot. And with the monthly \u201cSounds of the Earth\u201d compilation, you can travel the globe from your bed.\nBoring Books for Bedtime This weekly ad-free podcast brings together the relaxing effect of reading before bed with material where you won\u2019t mind losing your place. Host Sharon Handy (creator of the Great British Bake Off podcast Gin and Cake) calmly and quietly reads from a \u201cnot-at-all-riveting\u201d book available in the public domain. Most are nonfiction works from the turn of the century, and range from the esoteric \u2013 such as Ernest Ingersoll\u2019s \u201cearly history of boats\u201d The Book of the Ocean, published in 1898 \u2013 to classic titles you might have always intended to read, like Aurelius\u2019s Meditations. If you learn something before you fall asleep mid-sentence, well, that\u2019s just a bonus. (And yes, listening to a book definitely counts as having read it.)\nGoodnight, World! One does not simply \u201cput on a podcast\u201d to send kids off to sleep, my friend with a three-year-old tells me sternly: for little ones, any stimulus around bedtime needs to be carefully vetted and deployed. Goodnight, World! gets an immediate thumbs up from him. A partnership between Headspace and Sesame Street (and featuring some of its familiar faces), the podcast helps children wind down and transition into restful sleep, while easing the challenges for parents. My friend was impressed that it struck the balance between a bedtime story and a sleep aid, despite being only 20 minutes long, and singled out the palpable care put into production.

{"title": "Disappearance at Lake Elrod review \u2013 powerful performance in missing-girl movie", "article": "With this small-town gothic murder mystery director and co-writer Lauren Fash overdoes it with the missing-kid tropes: a grieving mom fighting for the truth; police corruption; buried secrets; a powerful family controlling the town; rusting pickup trucks; mean dudes with mullets. But there is just about enough psychological complexity in the mix in the shape of the central character Charlie, a gay woman winded by the disappearance of her eight-year-old daughter Lily. Charlie marches about town stapling missing posters to lamp-posts in the midst of an emotional breakdown or maybe even a psychotic episode \u2013 hallucinating, seeing her daughter in dark corners. Set in Georgia in the 1990s, the film opens a year after Lily vanishes. Tough but vulnerable Charlie is played beautifully by character actor Robyn Lively (half-sister of Blake) with a riveting less-is-more stillness. The local sheriff (Stan Houston) is ignoring her. Her partner Angela (Bethany Anne Lind) has walked out; homophobia already put a strain on their relationship. When another local girl disappears, for reasons that remain foggy to me, Charlie is the prime suspect. The latest missing girl is the daughter of a whiskey heir Chip Carmichael (Michael Trucco) \u2013 he\u2019s a toxic mix of mommy\u2019s boy and tree-trunk-necked neanderthal.\nThe twists and turns of the case, familiar from a dozen past thrillers, are mostly easy to predict. Instead, the script depends on a big character reveal that just about works if you don\u2019t think about it too hard or too long. There\u2019s another outstanding performance too, from Shameless\u2019s Shanola Hampton, as ambitious young TV journalist Amy, who wheedles Charlie into partnering up with her. A black female reporter, Amy is also an outsider and the two women give the movie a satisfying emotional core, even if the storyline is a bit of a letdown.

{"title": "The killing of Sophie Moss: why did a vulnerable mother\u2019s attacker get such a short sentence?", "article": "Last July, the home secretary, Priti Patel, fired off a triumphant tweet: \u201cWe have published a clause to end so-called \u2018rough sex defence\u2019 which enables perpetrators to avoid justice by claiming their victims consented to rough sex.\u201d The tweet was the result of rising fury over cases such as that of Natalie Connolly, the 26-year-old mother from Worcestershire, who in 2016 bled to death after sustaining more than 40 injuries, which her partner, John Broadhurst, claimed occurred as part of consensual sex. (His account was believed and he served less than two years for manslaughter.) In 2018, the campaign group We Can\u2019t Consent to This began collating cases and found that uses of the so-called \u201crough sex\u201d defence increased tenfold between 1996 and 2016 \u2013 and in 45% of cases had led to lesser charges of manslaughter rather than murder, or sometimes no charge at all. This weekend, the Sunday Times reported that nine British soldiers made jokes about \u201cchoking\u201d a Kenyan mother, Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was found dumped in a septic tank in Nanyuki, Kenya. Following a local police inquiry, a 2019 inquest presided over by a Kenyan judge concluded that one or two British soldiers were responsible for the death, but the MoD took no further action. The subject of Patel\u2019s tweet \u2013 section 71 of the Domestic Abuse Act (DAA), which states that a defendant cannot use the defence that the victim \u201cconsented to the infliction of the serious harm for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification\u201d \u2013 was going to change all that. Except it has not. Barely a year later, on 7 September, Sam Pybus, from Middleton St George, a village near Darlington in County Durham, was sentenced to just four years and eight months after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, a vulnerable mother of two. (He could expect to serve half that; compare this with the sentence this month of Penelope Jackson, 66, who will serve a minimum of 18 years for the murder of her husband, David Jackson, a man she claims was violent and coercively controlling; their daughter had seen him holding a knife to her mother\u2019s throat.)\nAt Pybus\u2019s trial, the court heard that, late on a Saturday night last February, after drinking 24 bottles of Amstel lager, he left the home he shared with his wife, Louise Howitt (who was sleeping upstairs), and drove to Moss\u2019s home in Darlington. Although Pybus claimed to recall little of what happened, Moss died after \u201csustained pressure\u201d to her neck, something Pybus claimed Moss \u201cenjoyed and encouraged\u201d during sex. According to his account, Pybus awoke in the early hours to find his hands were hurting and Moss unresponsive beside him. Rather than administering first aid or dialling 999, he got dressed, left the flat and sat in his car for 15 minutes, deciding what to do. Then he drove to the police station to give his story. His lenient sentence has sparked another outcry \u2013 and been referred to the court of appeal by the attorney general. The case is currently expected to be heard on 12 November. So what went wrong? Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, who has spent decades fighting discrimination in the justice system around male violence against women, admits that even she was surprised by the Pybus case, occurring so soon after the new clause was enacted. \u201cI think it\u2019s an embarrassment to the government that, having passed this law, heralded as a new intervention, you get the same outcome,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a sense, though, the DAA amendment did little more than codify what had already been determined. The legal principle that a person cannot legally consent to being injured or killed was already established. The amendment doesn\u2019t outlaw \u2018rough sex\u2019 as a defence.\u201d In cases like Pybus\u2019s, Broadhurst\u2019s or any other so-called \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d, the critical issue is not the victim\u2019s consent \u2013 it is the defendant\u2019s intent. And the judge in Pybus\u2019s case accepted that he did not intend to kill. A murder charge requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that someone intended to cause serious harm or death \u2013 and a statement from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) North East claimed that, with Pybus, the evidence for this was insufficient. \u201cFor me, the most concerning thing is, first, the way the case was investigated,\u201d says Wistrich. \u201cWas it with a view to determine whether Pybus was dangerous and a risk to women, or was it a search for evidence to stand up his story? Second, the readiness with which the CPS seemed to accept that evidence, instead of putting it to a jury, is impossible for me to understand. Third, the length of the sentence just seems so inappropriate.\u201d\nSome of those closest to the case agree. Howitt, Pybus\u2019s estranged wife, and Daniel Parkington, Moss\u2019s former partner and the father of her children, have been shocked by how quickly and easily Pybus\u2019s narrative slipped through. \u201cThe police told me at the very start that the charge would probably be downgraded to manslaughter,\u201d says Parkington. \u201cIt always felt like they were accepting the easy option. If it\u2019s tricky to take this person to court for murder and let a jury decide, you get the sense that they\u2019d rather accept a guilty plea to manslaughter and go for the slam dunk, the tick in the box. Move on. Next case.\u201d Parkington, 39, who works for his family\u2019s telecom business, lives 10 miles from Darlington with the boys, aged five and six, he fathered with Moss. He met Moss nine years ago when she worked in a stable yard and as a personal trainer in the local gym. \u201cShe was a hardworking girl with so much charm and charisma,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen Sophie entered a room, you knew she was there. I first introduced her to my family at my mum\u2019s 60th birthday dinner. They were amazed by how perfect she was. And she was perfect.\u201d The couple moved to a tiny cottage in the village of Bolton-on-Swale, North Yorkshire, before relocating to Darlington just before their first son was born. After six years, they separated \u2013 Parkington says Moss\u2019s deteriorating mental health and alcohol dependence were factors, although he stresses that he carries much of the blame. It was, he says, in the boys\u2019 best interests that the couple lived apart. Parkington had custody, but Moss remained central to all their lives. She would meet them at the school gates most mornings to see the boys into school. They would FaceTime every evening. They stayed with her on a weekly basis. Parkington would bring food to Moss at her flat and order her takeaways to make sure she was eating \u2013 two months before she was killed, she was seriously ill in hospital with liver and kidney infections. There was no doubt that Moss was extremely vulnerable to abuse. Parkington says he had witnessed one male visitor arrive at her flat at 9am with two bottles of wine. He had seen another \u2013 a local solicitor \u2013 bring wine in his lunch hour. \u201cI used to tell Sophie\u2019s friends that, if we didn\u2019t stop this, one day she\u2019ll turn round and say: \u2018I\u2019m not in the mood,\u2019 and some man is going to kill her.\u201d There were also, he says, high value items going missing from her flat, and money disappearing from her account on a monthly basis. (Parkington is convinced that CCTV footage at her local cash machine would confirm that someone else was using her card.)\nOn the night Moss was killed \u2013 before Pybus had arrived at her flat \u2013 she had texted Parkington and asked him to order a taxi to take her to hospital, as her ankles were swollen and she was struggling to walk. Unfortunately, Parkington was already asleep and did not see it until the morning. He refuses to accept that, just hours after texting him, Moss died by accident as a result of consensual choking. Parkington says: \u201cWhen the police told me, I immediately said: \u2018No way.\u2019 She didn\u2019t enjoy that type of thing. I knew Sophie better than anybody. She had the lowest pain threshold of anyone I\u2019ve ever known. Sophie\u2019s long-term boyfriend told the police the same thing. But the police accepted the account of Pybus and another unidentified person who used to visit her, who was not put in front of a jury to decide whether he was credible. All the judge heard were good character references for Pybus, and his terrible remorse.\u201d Howitt, a teacher studying for a PhD in linguistics, agrees that the investigation did not delve deeply. When the police arrived at her house on the Sunday morning, their first question was: \u201c\u2018Did Sam ever strangle you in bed?\u2019 It seemed like they took his narrative then looked for evidence to support it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were concentrating so much on: \u2018What did he do?\u2019 and: \u2018How did he do it?\u2019 The truth is that, yes, there were things he did to me when I was young and a bit naive and at the time I thought: \u2018This is what people do.\u2019 But it\u2019s really important that there were never any conversations about it first. Sam never, ever asked before he did it. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t dig any deeper about our marriage,\u201d continues Howitt. She claims that Pybus had got the couple into \u00a310,000 of debt due to reckless spending and payday loans. At one point, she had discovered he was texting numerous local women and sleeping with Moss, but whenever she tried to leave, Pybus would break down and threaten to kill himself. \u201cHe was so good at manipulating you and making you feel sorry for him,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they\u2019d really looked into Sam\u2019s history with women, they would have found abuse, sexual violence and just a complete lack of respect.\u201d (Another former partner wrote on Facebook when the case became news: \u201cI\u2019m just gonna put this out there before all the messages flood in. Yes, this is THAT Sam \u2026 I just hope that now nearly 10 years later those people who didn\u2019t believe my words as a young 19-year-old girl or judged me without knowing both sides now know what this boy is capable of.\u201d) Once the police had confirmed that Pybus had practised strangulation during sex in the past, and once the CPS had accepted his manslaughter plea, there was still scope for a lengthier sentence. Much depended on the judge\u2019s decision around Pybus\u2019s culpability, which can range from very high to low. According to sentencing guidelines, high culpability includes cases where death resulted from \u201can unlawful act which carried a high risk of death or GBH which was or ought to be obvious to the offender\u201d. This carries a sentence range of between eight and 16 years. Instead, Pybus seems to have been deemed to have had medium culpability, which carries a sentence range of three to nine years. On top of this would be a reduction for a guilty plea, and possible mitigating factors such as remorse and good character. (It seems an injustice that use of a weapon is an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing, whereas strangulation, the second most common method of femicide, is not.)\nFiona Mackenzie, the founder of We Can\u2019t Consent to This, has found the case hugely disappointing. \u201cWhat\u2019s so upsetting, right after the new amendment, is that it\u2019s immediately been demonstrated that police are not getting it, the CPS are not getting it and the judge did not get it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo what is the government going to do? Do we need more training? New guidelines for prosecution or sentencing?\u201d In the meantime, she hopes the impending appeal will increase Pybus\u2019s sentence. Wistrich, along with We Can\u2019t Consent to This, is exploring the possibility of bringing a third-party intervention to the appeal, to introduce additional points for consideration from witnesses including Howitt, who remains adamant that justice was not served. \u201cSam has written from prison,\u201d she says. \u201cHis letters are infuriating \u2013 all about making me feel sorry for him. He says he\u2019s so depressed, he has nothing in common with the other prisoners. Not once has he ever said he was sorry for killing Sophie or taking her away from her children.\u201d Moss\u2019s sons still call for their mum when they fall or hurt themselves. When Moss was killed, the UK was in lockdown, so, at home in his little bubble, Parkington put off telling his boys for several weeks. It was only when schools were reopening that he told them their mummy had been in hospital again and this time doctors couldn\u2019t save her. Sophie loved cats \u2013 she had four when she died, three of them rescues. The boys have taken one each. \u201cThey love them and I\u2019m sure it keeps their memories of their mummy more recent,\u201d says Parkington. \u201cWe can\u2019t kid ourselves, though. There\u2019s Google. They only need to type in their mum\u2019s name and all this will be there \u2013 and by the time that happens, the man who killed her could be out and free. \u201cIt consumes me. I think about it every minute of every day. It makes me so, so angry and that anger isn\u2019t all at him. A lot of it is to do with these people in powerful positions who make decisions that just aren\u2019t right. No sentence would be long enough in my mind, but how can this one ever be seen as fair? If the appeal isn\u2019t successful, then I just lose all faith. Surely there have got to be some good people out there.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/02/the-killing-of-sophie-moss-why-did-a-vulnerable-mothers-attacker-get-such-a-short-sentence", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:17:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "We are in Glasgow to demand justice for those most affected by the climate crisis | Bernard Ewekia, Jakapita Kandanga, Edwin Namakanga, Maria Reyes and Farzana Faruk Jhumu", "article": "How can you hold climate talks without including the most affected people? You can\u2019t. How can you make decisions on the best way to adapt to climate impacts without talking to those forced to adapt? You can\u2019t. And how can you deliver climate justice by continuing to ignore those that are suffering the most? You can\u2019t. As the Cop26 climate summit gets under way, and the so-called leaders of the world take centre stage to deliver yet more empty promises, we \u2013 five youth climate activists from five of the most affected areas across Africa, Asia, Central America and the South Pacific \u2013 have arrived despite attempts to shut us out. We have sailed into Glasgow onboard the Rainbow Warrior to let these presidents, prime ministers, policymakers and CEOs know that our voices will no longer remain unheard. They cannot and should not have these talks without us and we\u2019re demanding a seat at the table to make sure they finally act. The climate crisis is a global crisis that requires global action. But it does not affect everyone in the same way. It\u2019s a crisis of inequalities. We are all in the same storm, but we are not all in the same boat. Today there are five times more extreme weather events \u2013 devastating storms, floods, droughts, water scarcity and heatwaves \u2013 than 50 years ago, and they disproportionately affect those of us living in the most vulnerable areas, especially in the global south. Last year, climate disasters displaced more people from our communities than war and violent conflict, again mostly from the global south. Yet we are not the ones that have caused this crisis. Since 1965, one-third of global emissions, driven by the relentless exploitation of fossil fuels, have been caused by just 20 companies. Rich nations are responsible for 92% of global emissions, with the US and countries in Europe causing almost two-thirds of those. We\u2019re just the ones forced to live with, or sadly in many cases die because of, its impacts. Yet our voices continue to be sidelined. In our home countries of Namibia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Mexico and Tuvalu in the South Pacific, we face many different challenges. But they are all exacerbated by the same injustices such as gender violence, forced migration and racial injustices, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. These are all symptoms of the same rotten system. We have friends who have dropped out of school because droughts have forced their families into poverty and famine. Others are forced to literally sell their children in order to meet their basic needs. Many people have lost land, homes and crops to floods and rising sea levels. More are being forced to flee their homes and communities. And even just accessing safe drinking water is a daily struggle for many. Thousands of people are dying right now because of the climate crisis: the world leaders at this summit have blood on their hands. While corporate greed and a failure to act from governments in the global north are driving climate change, the disparities between rich and impoverished, between those who are causing this crisis and those who are not, don\u2019t end there. The inequalities also run deep within our countries. Corruption and neocolonialism are rife. Communities are displaced by industry as politicians sell off our land to oil companies, promising prosperity and jobs for local people who have been forced deeper into poverty by the climate crisis. Our communities are being misled. Those jobs never come, but the pollution, environmental destruction \u2013 along with emotional and cultural destruction \u2013 and more severe climate impacts always do. For over a decade, rich nations have failed to deliver the international climate finance that they have promised. This is not aid, nor just the help they\u2019re obliged to provide. This is a debt that they owe us for the environmental death and destruction that they have caused \u2013 and it must be paid in full. What little of this debt that actually is repaid rarely reaches those who need it. But no one questions our governments. No one checks up on how this money is being spent. Policies put in place to protect our local environments are meaningless while corrupt politicians remain in charge. But speaking out in our countries can result in grave consequences. We are literally putting our lives on the line \u2013 so it is imperative that our voices are heard. The leaders gathering in Glasgow have failed to act on the science. They have failed for decades to tackle the climate crisis. And they have failed to listen to people from the most affected areas who are now suffering from the consequences of their failure to act. Enough is enough. We are here to let them know that we will continue to fight for climate justice until they stop failing us. They must not deny us the platform to freely defend our present and futures. They must not ignore our demands. And they must not continue to put profit over people and the planet. The system must be uprooted before it is too late.

{"title": "First Thing: world leaders agree to end deforestation and slash methane emissions", "article": "Good morning. World leaders have agreed a deal that aims to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade as part of a multibillion-dollar package to tackle human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Xi Jinping, Jair Bolsonaro and Joe Biden are among the leaders who will commit to the declaration at Cop26 in Glasgow today to protect vast areas. Meanwhile, Biden will try to underscore his green credentials by unveiling an action plan to control methane, regarded by the administration as the single most potent way to combat the climate crisis in the short term. Leading an alliance of 90 countries, including for the first time Brazil, he will set out new regulatory measures today to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. Major producers and consumers of deforestation-linked commodities including Indonesia, China and Brazil have put their name to the deforestation deal, which aims to curtail the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The detailed US proposals on methane gases may prove to be one of the lasting successes of Cop26 in Glasgow where Biden will announce his action plan. On Monday, Biden urged other world leaders to embark upon a shift to clean energy and vowed that the US will \u2018lead by example\u2019. California legalized weed five years ago. Why is the illicit market still thriving?\nFive years after cannabis legalization, California is awash with signs of an apparently booming industry. Californians can toke on Justin Bieber-branded joints and ash their blunts in Seth Rogen\u2019s $95 ceramics. They can sip on THC-infused seltzers, relax inside a cannabis cafe and get edibles delivered to their doors. But behind the flashy facade, the legal weed industry remains far from the law-abiding, prosperous sector many had hoped for. In fact, it\u2019s a mess. Voters passed a law in November 2016 making recreational marijuana legal. But today, the vast majority of the market remains underground \u2013 about 80-90% of it, according to experts. Because that 2016 law, known as Proposition 64, gave municipalities the power to ban weed as they see fit, the majority of cities and counties still don\u2019t allow the sale of cannabis, inhibiting the growth of the legal market. What else is causing the illegal market to thrive? Business owners say high taxes, the limited availability of licenses, and expensive regulatory costs have put the legal market out of reach. How do those who are licensed to sell cannabis legally stay afloat? For now, the only way legal, state-licensed businesses say they are able to stay profitable is to keep one foot in the illegal, unlicensed market. Republican senator Josh Hawley worries feminism has driven men to \u2018pornography and video games\u2019\nThe effort to combat toxic masculinity in the US has led men to consume more pornography and play more video games, the Missouri senator Josh Hawley claimed in a speech to a group of Republicans. Speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Florida, Hawley addressed the issue of \u201cmanhood\u201d, which he said was under attack, and called for men to return to traditional masculine roles. The Donald Trump supporter who notoriously raised a fist in support of a mob outside the US Capitol on 6 January appeared to echo talking points made by the likes of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that opposes feminism and believes men are under attack from liberal elites. \u201cCan we be surprised that after years of being told that they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games?\u201d Hawley said. Hawley did not cite sources for his belief that men were watching pornography more frequently. Nonetheless, on Monday his speech was republished by the Federalist, a rightwing outlet. Hawley is the son of a banker and attended private school before studying at Stanford and Yale. Given his background, he has repeatedly raised eyebrows for railing against elites and claiming to speak for all men. In other news \u2026\nMexican journalists have expressed alarm after two veteran reporters were attacked in their own homes in less than 24 hours, bringing this year\u2019s death toll for media workers to nine \u2013 already surpassing the eight deaths recorded in 2020. Robert Durst was indicted on Monday for murder in the death of his first wife, Kathie McCormack Durst. The multimillionaire real estate heir is currently serving a life sentence in California for the murder of Susan Berman, who prosecutors say helped him cover up Kathie Durst\u2019s killing.

Stat of the day: Almost one in three of Republicans say violence may be necessary to \u2018save\u2019 US\nAlmost a third of Republicans believe violence may be necessary to \u201csave\u201d the US, according to a poll. Researchers at the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit, found that 30% of Republicans agreed with the statement: \u201cBecause things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\u201d Among Americans who believe the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from Donald Trump, which it was not, 39% believe violence may be required. Don\u2019t miss this: Second act sensations! Meet the people who reached peak fitness \u2013 after turning 50\nWhat combination of factors leads anyone to go all out at the gym, become a marathon runner or walk miles a day after the age of 50? Motivation is complex, and people differ, but the fact that mortality is nibbling at your heels, midlife restlessness has set in and with it the desire for reinvention, alongside a shift from active parenting or full-time work, may all contribute. Sometimes, a low-level unease gradually crystallises into a sense of urgency. \u201cI had this sense that if I didn\u2019t do something soon, it would be too late,\u201d says Rich Jones. Climate check: why chefs are ditching the avocado\nOn the one hand, they are deliciously creamy, versatile and gloriously Instagrammable.

{"title": "\u2018Make it a Christian town\u2019: the ultra-conservative church on the rise in Idaho", "article": "A Guardian investigation has revealed that a controversial church whose leader has openly expressed the ambition of creating a \u201ctheocracy\u201d in America has accumulated significant influence in the city of Moscow, Idaho.\nChrist Church has a stated goal to \u201cmake Moscow a Christian town\u201d and public records, interviews, and open source materials online show how its leadership has extended its power and activities in the town. Church figures have browbeaten elected officials over Covid restrictions, built powerful institutions in parallel to secular government, harassed perceived opponents, and accumulated land and businesses in pursuit of a long-term goal of transforming America into a nation ruled according to its own, ultra-conservative moral precepts. The rise of Christ Church may be playing out in a small Idaho city but it comes at a time when the US is roiled by the far right, including Christian nationalism, and when social conservatives are seeking to roll back basic tenets of US life such as legal abortion, as well as dominating powerful national institutions, such as the supreme court. While the church\u2019s previous controversies have centered on its founder and pastor, Douglas Wilson, a new generation of male church leaders \u2013 including Wilson\u2019s son \u2013 have found ways to expand the church\u2019s reach in Moscow and beyond, even gaining footholds in mainstream popular culture in the broader US. In recent months, Christ Church has advocated for resistance to Covid mandates in Moscow, and Wilson has attempted to give theological ballast to opposition to restrictions and vaccination programs, as well as warning of political violence. Last month, a video version of a post by Wilson at his well-read blog was removed from YouTube. The blogpost, entitled \u201cA Biblical Defense of Fake Vaccine IDs\u201d, was based on a conspiracy theory asserting that the vaccine response was a \u201cpower play\u201d on the part of the Biden administration, which intended to leave the restrictions in place permanently. Wilson further claimed that \u201cwe are not yet in a hot civil war, with shooting and all, but we are in a cold war/civil war\u201d and urged readers to \u201cresist openly, in concert with any others in your same position\u201d, claiming that this would not be \u201crebellion against lawful authority\u201d but \u201can example of a free people refusing to go along with their own enslavement\u201d. The post was met with outrage, including from other prominent evangelicals. That was not the only time that Wilson\u2019s activities and positions have led to criticism from other evangelicals, and associations with Wilson have led to crises in other churches. In recent months, members and clergy resigned from Minneapolis\u2019s Bethlehem Baptist church, and staff resigned from its associated Bethlehem College and Seminary (BCS), in part over the appearance of newly appointed BCS president Joe Rigney on Man Rampant, a video series hosted by Wilson and streamed on platforms including Amazon Prime. The show promotes Wilson\u2019s long-held position that men need to assert themselves in society. Christ Church was founded in Moscow in the 1990s, and experts who have studied the church estimate the size of the congregation and its offshoot churches at about 2,000, or 10% of the city\u2019s total population. But they also say that the church is increasingly drawing people to the area who are attracted to the idea of northern Idaho as a conservative \u201credoubt\u201d against American modernity, and by the church\u2019s \u201creconstructionist\u201d position, which holds that the world will need to be governed according to their interpretation of biblical morality before Christ returns to earth. Christ Church\u2019s previous controversies have garnered national attention. Recent reporting focused attention once more on the church\u2019s \u2013 and Wilson\u2019s \u2013 handling of a series of sexual abuse cases, and the theological subordination of women. In 2005, Wilson asked a judge for leniency in the case of Stephen Sitler, a former student at a Christ Church-aligned college, New Saint Andrews College (NSAC). Sitler was at that time convicted of sex offenses involving children. After his release on probation in 2007, Sitler was married in Christ Church in 2010, by Wilson, to a woman who, by Sitler\u2019s and her account, had been introduced to him by Edwin Iverson, then a Christ Church elder and now pastor of a Council of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) church in Colville, Washington. Wilson has faced scrutiny over other positions. In the early 2000s, Wilson received criticism over a book, Southern Slavery as it Was, which he had co-written in the previous decade with J Steven Wilkins. Wilkins is a Louisiana pastor who was a co-founder of the neo-Confederate organization, the League of the South. His church is a member of Wilson\u2019s congregational umbrella group, the CREC. The book depicted slavery in the antebellum southern United States as \u201ca relationship based upon mutual affection and confidence\u201d, and argued that the enslaved enjoyed \u201ca life of plenty, of simple pleasures, of food, clothes, and good medical care\u201d. Wilson has repeatedly disavowed any interest in national electoral politics, but Christ Church\u2019s eventual aim is what Wilson explicitly describes in a 2016 book as \u201ctheocracy\u201d, or \u201ca network of nations bound together by a formal acknowledgement of the lordship of Jesus Christ\u201d, as opposed to secular society ruled by \u201ccivil governments, [which] are in necessary degrees satanic, demonic, and influenced by the god of this world, who is the devil\u201d. These beliefs have led Christ Church into conflicts with local government, but additionally, Wilson and other Christ Church members have founded a range of local and national institutions which are affiliated with or sponsored by the church. Christ Church itself is an unincorporated nonprofit, which means that it is not obliged to provide details of its finances to government authorities. Many entities associated with the church are either also unincorporated, like the Logos School, or, like publisher Canon Press, are operated by a network of limited liability companies (LLCs) which are similarly limited in their accountability. But insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity said that all members tithe 10% of their household income, and wealthier members are expected to make an even larger contribution. Within a network of educational institutions, publishing houses, churches, and national associations that Wilson has founded or led, a small number of men, from a small number of families, have come to exert significant power within the organisation and Moscow. Not least among these is Wilson\u2019s own family, with him as its head.\nAt NSAC, for example, the college president is Wilson\u2019s son-in-law, Ben Merkle. Another son-in-law, Luke Jankovic, sits on the board of trustees, as does Wilson himself and Christ Church\u2019s associate pastor, Toby Sumpter. Douglas Wilson is also on faculty at NSAC, and is listed as a senior fellow in theology. Also on faculty are his son Nathan (ND) Wilson, a fellow of literature; and his brother, Gordon Wilson, a self-described \u201cyoung earth creationist\u201d who believes that God created the earth in seven days, is senior fellow of natural history. According to tax filings, Merkle and Gordon Wilson each draw salaries from the college, which lists tuition and costs for undergraduate students at $19,900 per year. Merkle, Jankovic, and all three Wilson men are also elders at Christ Church, along with a founding director and former trustee at NSAC, Moscow resident Andrew Crapuchettes. Until June 2021, when the company was acquired by a competitor, Crapuchettes had been chief executive of Moscow\u2019s largest private employer, EMSI, for more than 19 years. During that period, EMSI was a major employer of NSAC graduates. According to LinkedIn data, there are 55 current employees at EMSI who are NSAC graduates, from a college which has graduated only 635 people throughout its history. In addition, a number of Christ Church elders hold senior positions at EMSI. They include Luke Jankovic \u2013 the NSAC trustee who is Wilson\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 who is now executive vice-president of higher education. Also, EMSI\u2019s chief operations officer and chief financial officer is Timothy van den Broek, a teaching elder at Trinity Reformed church, Christ Church\u2019s suburban offshoot. Van den Broek began his career at EMSI immediately after graduating from NSAC, and he sits on the boards of church-aligned businesses and organizations, including their charity, the Hope Center, and Classic Learning Initiatives, which aims to devise alternative standardized testing for students at Christian private schools who wish to attend private Christian universities like NSAC. Since his departure from EMSI, Andrew Crapuchettes has started a new venture, a jobs website called Red Balloon, which advertises itself as connecting \u201cemployers who value freedom with employees who value it too\u201d, in \u201ca world beyond cancel culture, where employees are free to work \u2026 without fear that they will find themselves on the wrong side of their employer\u2019s politics\u201d. Many of the website\u2019s initial clients appeared to be either church run or founded organizations, or companies belonging to other church members. Now, Crapuchettes has branched out into property development, and this year won approval from Moscow city council for the \u201cannexation\u201d of 27 acres of land on Moscow\u2019s south-western edge for a new, 109 unit subdivision called Edington. A local businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the church already had a disproportionate presence in the downtown area, and that developments like Edington were evidence that \u201cthey are trying to attract more people here\u201d. He added that the church\u2019s anti-mask and anti-vaccination positions, as well as its attempts to \u201ctake over local institutions\u201d like a food co-op, had polarized the community. He also referred to an ad for New Saint Andrews College that had been seen as transphobic by many in Moscow had \u201cgalvanized the town against them\u201d. He called it a demonstration of the church\u2019s preparedness \u201cto throw red meat and recruit on the basis of hate\u201d. In response to detailed emailed questions about various aspects of Christ Church\u2019s operations, Douglas Wilson did not offer any specific response, but wrote that the Guardian\u2019s \u201capproach illustrates an absurd fixation and anti-church bigotry that we have come to expect from certain elements of the leftist media\u201d. Asked about EMSI\u2019s hiring practices under his leadership, Andrew Crapuchettes wrote that: \u201cUnder my watch, EMSI grew into a global company with offices on two continents, and in an ever-tightening labor market, we hired talent wherever we could find it, including from the 3 local colleges \u2013 Washington State, University of Idaho and New Saint Andrews.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/christ-church-idaho-theocracy-us-america", "last_update": "2021-11-02T02:23:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},

But I should have: Clinton\u2019s co-writer is the hugely classy Canadian crime writer Louise Penny and this appears to be a match made in heaven. Ellen Adams is secretary of state for a new administration, which has just been sworn in after the \u201cnear-criminal incompetence\u201d of its predecessor. \u201cThe former administration screwed up everything it touched. It poisoned the well, poisoned our relationships. We\u2019re the leader of the free world in name only.\u201d She\u2019s in her late 50s, the former boss of a media empire, and she thinks she has a little time to learn on the job until bombs start going off in the major European cities and there\u2019s no information about who\u2019s responsible. This is meticulously plotted, intelligent and terrifying, a portrait of a world facing terrible threats, where \u201caccomplished middle-aged women were often diminished by small men\u201d, female friendship is key and where we are given delightful titbits from America\u2019s former secretary of state such as this one, on the British prime minister: \u201cA hollow man, an upper-class twit, with any guts he might have had replaced by entitlement and random Latin phrases.\u201d Don\u2019t miss it. The Missing Hours Julia Dahl Faber, \u00a312.99, pp288 Claudia Castro is a rich, beautiful and privileged social media queen at NYU, but when Julia Dahl\u2019s The Missing Hours opens, she\u2019s waking up in pain, her underwear gone, her skirt smelling of urine and her face beaten. Claudia doesn\u2019t remember what happened to her and she doesn\u2019t want to talk to anybody: not her sister, who is about to have a baby, not her music producer father, not a counsellor. \u201cDid you hear Claudia Castro says somebody raped her?\u201d she imagines them gossiping. \u201cOne of those disgusting reality TV blogs\u2026 would probably pay ten grand for that headline.\u201d So she says nothing, waits, heals. As New York is stalked by an attacker who is slashing their victims with a knife, \u201cover and over Claudia read the word, heard the word: victim. The victim\u2019s mother says her life will never be the same. The victim\u2019s husband says her children are afraid. The victim the victim the victim. The word had spikes.\u201d Then a phone video emerges of Claudia\u2019s attack and she slowly sinks out of sight, determined that she isn\u2019t going to be another victim. This is a dark, gripping study of vengeance and of what it means to live in a woman\u2019s body. The Apollo Murders Chris Hadfield Quercus, \u00a320, pp470 Astronaut Chris Hadfield is known for his bestselling nonfiction as well as his time as commander of the International Space Station. The Apollo Murders is his first venture into fiction and it is set around the launch and flight of Apollo 18 in 1973, in reality cancelled by President Nixon, but here setting out for the moon, by way of a Russian space station that the Americans believe is conducting military espionage. \u201cFor the first time in history the United States is going to take hostile military action in space.\u201d Our hero is Nasa flight controller Kazimieras \u201cKaz\u201d Zemeckis, a former pilotwho lost his eye flying an F-4 Phantom, while it\u2019s soon clear that many of those on this mission have agendas of their own. The plot hangs together well, although why does Kaz not know the moon is tidally locked to the Earth? Even I know that. But the real and genuine joy of The Apollo Murders is the insight Hadfield gives into life as an astronaut, the moments as launch approaches: \u201cStill three miles away, yet clearly visible high above the flood plain, the Saturn V rocket was like some ancient Egyptian monument to the gods\u2026 gleaming white in the morning sunshine.\u201d The Gs as the rocket takes off. The wonders of space. Riccardino Andrea Camilleri Mantle, \u00a316.99, pp304 All hail the final novel from the brilliant Andrea Camilleri, the late Italian author who gave us the inimitable Sicilian detective Inspector Montalbano. Camilleri actually wrote Riccardino in 2004 and 2005, updating it in 2016, but gave orders for it not to be published until after his death. He died in Rome in 2019, aged 93, and here it is, a whimsical and wonderful conclusion to Montalbano\u2019s story. Translated by Stephen Sartarelli, Riccardino opens as the detective receives a phone call from a wrong number: it\u2019s a man called Riccardino and Montalbano soon sends him on his way. Shortly afterwards, he learns that Riccardino has been murdered and starts investigating. But \u201csome years back [Montalbano] had the brilliant idea to tell a local writer the story of a case he\u2019d conducted, and the guy had immediately spun it into a novel\u201d; this author now tells the detective he\u2019s going about solving the crime all wrong, saying: \u201cYou keep invoking the problem of imminent old age, but I know perfectly well that it\u2019s just an excuse for covering your increasing indecision.\u201d Though Riccardino gets increasingly meta, in the end it is a moving finale to this peerless series.

{"title": "\u2018Is it OK to \u2026\u2019: the bot that gives you an instant moral judgment", "article": "Corporal punishment, wearing fur, pineapple on pizza \u2013 moral dilemmas, are by their very nature, hard to solve. That\u2019s why the same ethical questions are constantly resurfaced in TV, films and literature. But what if AI could take away the brain work and answer ethical quandaries for us? Ask Delphi is a bot that\u2019s been fed more than 1.7m examples of people\u2019s ethical judgments on everyday questions and scenarios. If you pose an ethical quandary, it will tell you whether something is right, wrong, or indefensible. Anyone can use Delphi. Users just put a question to the bot on its website, and see what it comes up with. The AI is fed a vast number of scenarios \u2013 including ones from the popular Am I The Asshole sub-Reddit, where Reddit users post dilemmas from their personal lives and get an audience to judge who the asshole in the situation was. Then, people are recruited from Mechanical Turk \u2013 a market place where researchers find paid participants for studies \u2013 to say whether they agree with the AI\u2019s answers. Each answer is put to three arbiters, with the majority or average conclusion used to decide right from wrong. The process is selective \u2013 participants have to score well on a test to qualify to be a moral arbiter, and the researchers don\u2019t recruit people who show signs of racism or sexism. The arbitrators agree with the bot\u2019s ethical judgments 92% of the time (although that could say as much about their ethics as it does the bot\u2019s). In October, a New York Times piece about a writer who potentially plagiarized from a kidney donor in her writing group inspired debate. The bot obviously didn\u2019t read the piece, nor the explosion of Reddit threads and tweets. But it has read a lot more than most of us \u2013 it has been posed over 3m new questions since it went online. Can Delphi be our authority on who the bad art friend is?\nOne point to Dawn Dorland, the story\u2019s kidney donor. Can it really be that simple? We posed a question to the bot from the other perspective \u2026\nThe bot tries to play both sides. I asked Yejin Choi, one of the researchers from University of Washington, who worked on the project alongside colleagues at the Allen Institute for AI, about how Delphi thinks about these questions. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive to how you phrase the question. Even though we might think you have to be consistent, in reality, humans do use innuendos and implications and qualifications. I think Delphi is trying to read what you are after, just in the way that you phrase it.\u201d With this in mind, we tried to pose some of the great questions of politics, culture and literature.\n\nThe bot does answer some questions with striking nuance. For example, it distinguishes whether it is rude to mow the lawn late at night (it is rude), versus whether it is OK to mow the lawn late at night when your neighbor is out of town (it is OK). But previous versions of the bot answered Vox\u2019s question \u201cIs genocide OK\u201d with: \u201cIf it makes everybody happy.\u201d A new version of Delphi, which launched last week, now answers: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d Choi points out that, of course, the bot has flaws, but that we live in a world where people are constantly asking answers of imperfect people, and tools \u2013 like Reddit threads and Google. \u201cAnd the internet is filled with all sorts of problematic content. You know, some people say they should spread fake news, for example, in order to support their political party,\u201d she says. So you could argue that all this really tells us is whether the bot\u2019s views are consistent with a random selection of people\u2019s, rather than whether something is actually right or wrong. Choi says that\u2019s OK: \u201cThe test is entirely crowdsourced, [those vetting it] are not perfect human beings, but they are better than the average Reddit folk.\u201d But she makes clear that the intention of the bot is not to be a moral authority on anything. \u201cPeople outside AI are playing with that demo, [when] I thought only researchers would play with it \u2026 This may look like an AI authority giving humans advice which is not at all what we intend to support.\u201d Instead, the point of the bot is to help AI to work better with humans, and to weed out some of the many biases we already know it has. \u201cWe have to teach AI ethical values because ai interacts with humans. And to do that, it needs to be aware what values human have,\u201d Choi says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/02/delphi-online-ai-bot-philosophy", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:52:35Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Cleo Smith search: WA police examining \u2018every inch\u2019 of campsite for \u2018disturbances in sand\u2019", "article": "West Australian police are using drones and aircraft to create a detailed map of the Blowholes campsite as they look for \u201cdisturbances in the sand\u201d during the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of four-year-old Cleo Smith. Police recruits are also sifting through a mountain of rubbish collected from roadside bins stretching more than 600km along Western Australia\u2019s north-west coast in the hope of finding any clue that could lead to Cleo. The four-year-old vanished from the Blowholes campsite on the coast of Macleod, about 950km north of Perth, on 16 October. Her mum, Ellie Smith, was the last known person to see her when the family were camping almost three weeks ago. She said her daughter woke about 1.30am asking for water before going back to bed. In the morning Cleo and her sleeping bag were gone from the family\u2019s tent. Acting police commissioner Col Blanch on Tuesday said the force was using drones as they looked to \u201cmap every inch\u201d of the area.\n\u201cWe are looking for disturbances in sand,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cWe\u2019ve used satellite technology, we used aircraft to take high-definition photos. We really need to make a good quality mapping of that area to make sure that we cover every inch.\u201d Blanch said the initial search focused on looking for Cleo if she had potentially wandered off. \u201cNow we are in a stage where we need to forensically go over that ground inch by inch to see what disturbances might be in the nearby areas for any sort of evidence that might give an inkling as to what happened,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Authorities are conducting line searches too. WA police had previously said there was nothing to suggest the account given by Cleo\u2019s parents was anything but \u201caccurate and truthful\u201d. Guardian Australia is not suggesting they were involved in Cleo\u2019s disappearance. More than 50 cubic metres of rubbish has been collected from bins stretching as far south as Geraldton, more than 500km from where Cleo vanished, and as far north as Minilya, 165km away. WA police believe Cleo may have been abducted, with the state government offering a $1m reward for any information that helps them find the people or person responsible for her disappearance. The rubbish was packed into trucks and transported to Perth where four forensics officers and 20 officers spent days sorting through hundreds of bags in an effort to find any items that may assist in the investigation. The search of the rubbish was \u201cstill going on today and will take a while to get through,\u201d Blanch said on Tuesday. He said police were still looking for a vehicle they believed turned off Blowholes Road about 3.30am on the day Cleo went missing and drove south towards Carnarvon along the coast road. The acting commissioner said it was thought to be a \u201csmaller passenger-type vehicle\u201d. That sighting remained a \u201csignificant focus of the investigation,\u201d he said. Blanch said given the remoteness of the area there were some potential routes from the campsite to Carnarvon without any CCTV coverage. Asked if Cleo could have been watched or followed at the campsite, he said investigators were keeping an open mind so \u201call avenues are still a possibility\u201d. But the detective leading the investigation, Det Supt Rod Wilde, believes she was likely taken by an \u201copportunistic\u201d offender. Wilde said on Tuesday the family had stayed near their tent all evening and had not socialised with other campers. \u201cI think it\u2019s more than likely an opportunistic-type event,\u201d he told Perth radio 6PR. \u201cWe know they got there on the Friday night, it was getting dark, and there would have been limited opportunity for people to observe Cleo at that time.\u201d There are 100 people on the taskforce searching for Cleo \u2013 50 locally and 50 in Perth. The working theory is that she was still in WA because it was a \u201chigh-risk proposition\u201d someone would try and take her out of the state, Blanch said. He called on people in the community to look out for anyone they knew behaving strangely \u201cor a little bit off\u201d after 16 October. The acting commissioner said it was difficult to remain hopeful as the search dragged on but investigators were \u201cfocused absolutely on this case trying to bring Cleo home\u201d. Crime Stoppers have had 200 possible sightings of Cleo since she went missing and members of the public have come forward with hours of CCTV and dashcam footage in the hope that it helps.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since four-year-old Cleo Smith was last seen, and while the search for answers continues we\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the public for their ongoing assistance, attention and support for the investigation,\u201d WA police said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis investigation could not progress without new information, and we\u2019re receiving that every day from people who want to help, who want to see Cleo return home to her family.\u201d - with Australian Associated Press", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/wa-police-sift-through-rubbish-for-clues-in-investigation-into-cleo-smiths-disappearance", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:53:43Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Females with fair skin\u2019: Mayfair casino guilty of race discrimination, tribunal finds", "article": "An exclusive London casino racially discriminated against one of its dealers by allowing a request by a patron not to have black dealers at their table, an employment tribunal has found. Semhar Tesfagiorgis, 41, successfully sued Crown London Aspinalls, in Mayfair, over an incident in December 2019, when she and a black colleague were prevented from working at the table of a patron who had requested \u201cfemales with fair skin\u201d. The casino had tried to argue that the reason for not allowing Tesfagiorgis and her colleague to deal to the patron was not because of race but because of the perception that it was necessary to accommodate patrons\u2019 request, no matter how unreasonable, in order to the further the interests of the business. This was rejected by the three-person panel sitting at London central employment tribunal, led by Judge Elliot. In a written judgment, it said: \u201cOur finding is that the claimant and her black female colleagues were held back from going on duty because they were not \u2018fair-skinned, female dealers\u2019 or \u2018western-looking female staff\u2019 \u2026 \u201cThe accommodation of the request was direct race discrimination of the claimant because but for her race she would have been asked to deal to the patron. The granting of that request was less favourable treatment by the managers because of race.\u201d\nThe tribunal also found that a complaint relating to an incident in June 2015 would have succeeded as an act of direct race discrimination but was time-barred because the claim had been brought too late. In that incident, Aspinalls refused to accommodate a request by Tesfagiorgis for a shift swap because a patron did not want a black female dealer. The panel said: \u201cThe shift swap was refused because of the claimant\u2019s race: she did not fit the patron\u2019s requirement for \u2018white female dealers only\u2019, which the respondent accommodated. The reason the claimant was not one of the patron\u2019s preferred dealers is because she was not white. The refusal of the shift swap was less favourable treatment of the claimant because of her race.\u201d The panel noted that the casino had only one slide on a presentation given during training that dealt with patrons\u2019 behaviour, describing the training as \u201cinadequate\u201d. Comparing her victory to David versus Goliath, Tesfagiorgis, who worked as an inspector/dealer at Aspinalls between 2007 and 2020, said: \u201cI tried for many years to open a dialogue about the racism myself and many others were often faced with but I was either shut down, ignored or gaslighted each time. \u201cThe direct discrimination myself and other black colleagues received was not an isolated incident. Although the tribunal could not rule on past events due to time limits, they have acknowledged this was the case and for once Crown Aspinalls will finally be forced to do the same, for this I am grateful to the employment tribunal.\u201d Her solicitor, Shazia Khan, a founding partner of Cole Khan, said she hoped the judgment led to \u201croot-and-branch reform of the casino and gaming industry to address the racist and sexist conduct that drove my client out of a career she clearly loved\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/mayfair-casino-guilty-of-race-discrimination-tribunal-finds", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:05:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The billionaire and the Bolivian train cemetery: bold epic Rare Earth Mettle", "article": "There was a worry that when theatres reopened after months of pandemic-enforced closure, programming might be risk averse, with ambitions constrained by strapped finances. Al Smith\u2019s Rare Earth Mettle is not a constrained play. It is a multi-stranded, multi-character, continent-hopping drama that centres on the Bolivian salt flats but encompasses numerous plotlines and locations. It was commissioned pre-pandemic \u2013 they were midway through rehearsals when theatres closed in March last year \u2013 but the Royal Court has remained committed to bringing it to the stage. Smith\u2019s protagonist, Hershel Fink, is an Elon Musk-esque billionaire who believes he can save the world by building electric cars. He\u2019ll get richer in the process of course, which he\u2019s fine with. Local indigenous communities also want to benefit from the deal. Smith had wanted to address climate change, but he felt that a lot of the theatre that did so either took the form of a lecture \u2013 Katie Mitchell\u2019s Ten Billion, for example \u2013 or had a dystopian approach. Neither of those routes appealed. He had been reading about the Lithium Triangle, a region of the Andes that is thought to hold around 54% of the world\u2019s lithium reserves, and he started reading up on the politics and history of the region and about mineral rights. Struck by the image of the train cemetery in Uyuni, a series of rusting British locomotives sitting amid the salt flats, he thought it was a great place to start a story: \u201can arresting, bright empty space\u201d.\nSmith is married to an NHS doctor and some of their conversations about the mental and physical health of the nation made it into the play. Gradually, he says, these different ideas and images coalesced, connections formed: lithium, as well as being a component of batteries, is also a mood stabiliser. The play, says Smith, forces you to take a position where benevolent technocracy is the solution to the climate crisis; he doesn\u2019t agree with that himself, but it\u2019s intended as a provocation. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough faith in people to change our behaviour in a way that is rationally best for the planet.\u201d The play is also interested in ideas of language \u2013 it is full of instances of meaning being lost in translation \u2013 and in history, both cultural and personal. Fink has tried to detach himself from his past. \u201cHe sees it as somehow getting in the way of his grand messianic view.\u201d\nAs he was writing, Smith asked himself: \u201cDoes it need to be this big? Should I cut a strand? And I resisted it.\u201d The Royal Court never told him to restrict the play for reasons of scale or cost. \u201cThat is a wonderful gift to be given as a writer.\u201d It\u2019s being directed by Hamish Pirie who has a rich visual approach \u2013 he put a ball-pit on stage for Tim Price\u2019s Teh Internet is Serious Business and a flock of live goats in Goats by Syrian playwright Liwaa Yazji. While Smith is grateful to be back in the rehearsal room, he\u2019s acutely aware that you can\u2019t just pick up where you left off. The world has undergone a collective trauma and the pandemic is far from over. While theatres are now playing to full capacity audiences, he\u2019s aware of the increasing case rate and remains cautious, perhaps more so than most. As well as being a doctor, his wife is also a cancer patient and they were shielding throughout lockdown.\nSmith studied English at the University of Edinburgh. His first major play, Harrogate \u2013 a two-hander about a complicated father-daughter relationship and sexual role play \u2013 premiered at the High Tide festival in Aldeburgh and transferred to the Royal Court. He has also written for Holby City and EastEnders, as well as five series of Radio 4\u2019s Life Lines about an ambulance dispatch worker played by Sarah Ridgeway, who also starred in Harrogate. Smith spent some time at the South Western Ambulance Service Trust in Exeter, listening in on calls. He speaks with passion about the creative possibilities of radio drama. \u201cIt\u2019s something which doesn\u2019t receive a lot of press. I love the medium but it\u2019s getting hammered. The cuts in radio drama have been massive.\u201d Rare Earth Mettle is about power and apathy, he says. Fink asks people to save the world by allowing him to absorb all the risk. Which is nuts, says Smith, but \u201cwhen you have that kind of ludicrous intellectual hypocrisy at the highest level, I don\u2019t know how anyone can be trusted to take a rational line about anything\u201d. Sometimes, he adds: \u201cI question whether the things I write are too absurd, but then I remember the secretary of state for culture ate bollocks on television for money. Rome is definitely burning.\u201d Rare Earth Mettle is at the Royal Court, London, 10 November-18 December.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/02/al-smith-rare-earth-mettle-climate-crisis-royal-court", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:32:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},

A senior US official said: \u201cThe High Ambition Coalition was instrumental in Paris in making sure that high ambition was written into the Paris agreement and will be instrumental in Glasgow in making sure it\u2019s delivered.\u201d Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, said: \u201cThe High Ambition Coalition has set the bar for what needs to happen at this Cop: getting on track to limiting temperature rise to 1.5C with enhanced [nationally determined contributions] and with real, actual actions, like phasing out coal; a sea-change on adaptation, with at least a doubling of current levels of adaptation financing; and making sure that we all have the resources we need to face this crisis, including the loss and damage we\u2019re already experiencing today. \u201cThese heads of state have given their marching orders for ambition.\u201d\nOne negotiator said fears that the 1.5C target was in danger of slipping out of reach had prompted the group\u2019s resurgence. \u201cWe are extremely concerned about 1.5C,\u201d they said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are calling for a way to keep 1.5C as a viable option.\u201d The High Ambition Coalition was formed in the run-up to Paris by the chief negotiator for the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum. Though the tiny Pacific island state, made up of 29 atolls, has a population of only 60,000, the charismatic De Brum had a major influence at climate Cops. The goal of holding temperature rises to 1.5C rather than 2C is much harder to achieve, as it requires emissions cuts of at least 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. But science shows it is much safer \u2013 beyond 1.5C, many of the impacts of climate breakdown, such as melting ice sheets, become irreversible, and many small islands would face inundation from rising sea levels and storm surges. De Brum spent months taking soundings from developed and developing countries, and in the closing days, when it appeared that the 1.5C could be in danger, the coalition was announced. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, said earlier this year that the Paris goal of \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to 1.5C was \u201cbased on hard work by the High Ambition Coalition and the small island developing states. They felt it that it was imperative \u2013 and thank heavens they did. Science has now caught up to that fact, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] and IEA [International Energy Agency] and others have been pretty clear, that this is what we need to try to achieve.\u201d De Brum died in 2017.

{"title": "Phil Neville has everything to prove after Inter Miami\u2019s rough season", "article": "It took six years for David Beckham\u2019s Inter Miami team to make it onto a football field. It\u2019s going to take a while longer for success to follow. Under the guidance of head coach Phil Neville, the second-year expansion team is ending the season well adrift of the MLS playoffs. After leaving the England women\u2019s team to join his old Manchester United teammate in Miami, Neville was unable to lift a goal-shy roster into the Eastern Conference\u2019s top seven. Six straight losses \u2013 by a combined score of 16-1 \u2013 undid a promising mid-season revival that saw only one defeat in 11. Neville was recently fined for claiming Miami were \u201cbeing cheated\u201d by MLS referees, but it was a conference-low 35 goals in 33 games and a lack of collectivism that proved Miami\u2019s undoing. In mid-October, Neville admitted his team would be \u201cbottom of the league by a long way\u201d but for 12 goals from Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. Despite late-season signs of life \u2013 including a 5-1 win over Cincinnati \u2013 Miami were left needing a miracle. Saturday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to New York City, at which Beckham was present, extinguished faint playoff hopes and left Miami 11th out of 14 teams in the Eastern Conference, with one game remaining. Neville\u2019s position isn\u2019t under threat, despite this underachievement. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t expect us to finish higher and I take responsibility for that. But I can\u2019t wait for 17 January to attack next season as quick as possible,\u201d he said on Friday. Neville speaks of the need to for the team to become younger. During a recent press conference, he told the Guardian: \u201cI think this MLS is a young person\u2019s league. Maybe 10-15 years ago it was seen as a retirement league. Now some of the best young players are coming through the academies. We\u2019re a club that wants to produce our own players and we\u2019ve given debuts to some of our academy players.\u201d\nWith the coach\u2019s emphasis on reducing the average age (Miami have the fifth-oldest squad in MLS) and the acknowledgment MLS isn\u2019t pasture for aging Europeans, the 2021 signing of defenders Ryan Shawcross, 34, and Kieran Gibbs, 32, baffles. In truth, there are few signs the club is operating under a clear vision, on the commercial or playing side. In a damning report in The Athletic in August, a club source said: \u201cWe launched a brand, not a team.\u201d On the field, Neville bemoans the absence of a roster \u201cmore interested in the team than themselves.\u201d The expansion-team-finding-its-feet defence doesn\u2019t wash these days. Nashville joined MLS alongside Miami, sit second in the east and will move to a 30,000-seater stadium next season. In 2018, Atlanta United won MLS Cup in their second season. Sporting director Chris Henderson, a January acquisition from Seattle Sounders, could provide a more coherent team-building strategy. The continuity offered by a second-year coaching team will benefit Miami if Neville finds his feet. Neville\u2019s desire to field younger players is achievable but boosting the squad quality is more challenging. The club is hamstrung by $2,271,250 salary cap sanctions, spread over 2022 and 2023. Excluding the three designated player (DP) spots, each team can only spend $4.9m on player wages a season, leaving Miami down around 20%. MLS ruled 2020 salaries afforded to French World Cup winner Blaise Matuidi and Andres Reyes were worthy of designated player allocations; slots Miami filled elsewhere. An investigation also unearthed \u201cunderreporting of salary budget amounts\u201d for three more players. The punishment for this \u201cincorrect roster categorization\u201d (aka cheating) was severe. Oddly, the DP rule was adopted in 2007 so LA Galaxy could pay the $6.5m salary of a certain David Beckham. It means Neville\u2019s aspirations of blooding \u201ctwo, three, or four\u201d players from Miami\u2019s reserve side, Fort Lauderdale CF, must be realised. Due to existing commitments, enlisting new DPs is trickier. The current trio of Higua\u00edn, 33, Matuidi, 34, and the unfavoured Rodolfo Pizarro all have deals for next season. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation for everybody. The sanctions mean next year we\u2019re going to have to be really, really good at building a roster,\u201d Neville said. \u201cMe, Chris Henderson and the ownership will sit down and think of the best way to build a roster to be competitive. \u201cThis club has to be competitive. There are no excuses, whether we put the youngest team, or the oldest team out there. Come the first game next season, the supporters, ownership, manager, players, and MLS will be expecting us to compete and win games of football. This club has to win trophies, that\u2019s what I as a manager have to deliver.\u201d Harnessing local talent was part of the club\u2019s pitch. In 2018, Beckham promised to build a \u201cstate of the art\u201d academy and now has U-12 through U-17 teams playing at the first-team\u2019s training facility. Beckham is a regular at games and, by all accounts, gracious with his time with watching parents. It\u2019s intertwined with the club\u2019s efforts to join the fabric of the community, embracing the area\u2019s Latin heritage. It started with the name \u2013 Inter Miami Club de F\u00fatbol \u2013 and is reflected in the stands with a loud core of supporters dubbed \u201cLa Familia\u201d. On humid Florida nights, it feels like a South American arena. Max Ramos of The Siege supporters group says: \u201cWe\u2019re a f\u00fatbol club in an American sports league. The Supporters\u2019 Section is extremely Latin and the majority of the fanbase is Hispanic. The club has done a really good job of allowing us to go with a South American atmosphere within an American framework. \u201cOf course, there are things that you can\u2019t do next to an airport in Fort Lauderdale, that you can at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires! I can\u2019t launch a flare, for example. But the music, the lighting, it\u2019s very Miami. \u201cCould they do more, like having a stadium announcer, or more media in Spanish? Sure. But it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Local enthusiasm is waning slightly. Attendances are down up to a quarter on the mid-season peak of 17,925. But this is south Florida. Historically, winning cures all. The excitement can be relit. \u201cEveryone\u2019s pissed right now, but it can all change in a year,\u201d Ramos adds. Efforts to intertwine team and community \u2013 like September\u2019s \u201cCelebra Tu Patria\u201d Hispanic Heritage Night \u2013 remain difficult while Inter play in another city, an hour\u2019s drive away. The temporary stadium is in Fort Lauderdale, a much different cultural vibe. Word on the planned 25,000-seater stadium development in Freedom Park Miami is scant. \u201cThe stadium in Fort Lauderdale is lovely,\u201d Ramos adds. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a brilliant job of making it feel like a proper football stadium. If it was built in Miami instead of Fort Lauderdale, no-one would care. The problem is the name says \u2018Miami\u2019.\u201d Neville, for one, acknowledges little is ideal for the club\u2019s patient fans right now. \u201cThe supporters have suffered and suffered badly,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great plans for this football club, and I feel this season we\u2019ve put some of the bricks in the foundations to be successful in the years to come. It was never going to be a quick, overnight turnaround; it never is in football.\u201d Neville has faced questions about the club\u2019s ambitions multiple times a week lately, but this is still \u201cDavid Beckham\u2019s Inter Miami\u201d. Neville says Beckham is \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cwants better\u201d, but fans may appreciate occasionally hearing from the man who appointed the manager. Neville\u2019s first season in club management has been deeply disappointing. He only shot par with England women; now he must prove his Miami appointment wasn\u2019t just jobs for the boys.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/phil-neville-mls-inter-miami-david-beckham", "last_update": "2021-11-01T20:05:06Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Sudan\u2019s coup  has shattered  the hopes of its 2019 revolution | Nesrine Malik", "article": "Last week in Sudan, two years disappeared in a flash. Two years of working to bring Sudan in from the cold after almost three decades of isolation. Two years of trying to establish a civilian government. Two years of mourning those who had died in Sudan\u2019s revolution to oust Omar al-Bashir. And two years of tentative hope that perhaps these deaths had not been in vain. In the end, all that mattered was that it was two years during which the military grew tired of partnering with civilians in a transitional power-sharing agreement. Last week, the army seized power in a coup that erased everything the Sudanese people had gained since Bashir\u2019s military government was toppled in 2019. That revolution had reignited hope for democratic rule, not only in Sudan, but across the Arab world. In hindsight, its short-lived nature seems inevitable. Sudan\u2019s uprising may have removed Bashir, but behind him sat a military and security state with deep roots and complex economic interests. When it became clear that the Sudanese people were not going to tolerate another military figurehead as a replacement for Bashir, an agreement with civilian parties resulted in a transitional power-sharing arrangement that should have paved the way for elections.\nOne could argue that it was naive to expect the military and its associated allies to merely hand over power and withdraw to the barracks. But it also seemed unfathomable that they would make such a brash, regressive move as they have. The country\u2019s newfound stability is still in its infancy. The military now faces international condemnation and diplomatic crises. The coup has severed attempts to reintegrate Sudan into the international community. Debt relief has been suspended, leaving the economy on its knees. The US cancelled 700 million dollars worth of aid only 24 hours after the coup. Yet these calculations do not concern militaries who are bent on extraction in a country that does not need to thrive for its overlords to prosper. An alliance between a large army of mercenaries, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF, the formalised and uniformed version of the Janjaweed that terrorised the Darfur region), the army, and remnants of business interests from the Bashir regime now has the country in a tight grip. They will run Sudan as the host body for a partnership of parasites. Without facing the checks of transparency or accountability, Sudan\u2019s new ruling club will be able to divide the country\u2019s infrastructure, seizing raw materials such as gold, and selling them to regional allies. They will have the firepower to suppress rebellions in the country\u2019s marginalised regions. By doing dirty, lucrative deals with Gulf allies, they will be able to alienate whomever they please in the west. RSF forces have already sold Sudanese soldiers \u2013 some of them children \u2013 to the UAE and Saudi Arabia to provide support for their wars in Yemen. Flogging Sudan\u2019s resources and people to the highest bidder is too lucrative a business to give up for a few hundred million dollars of western aid. In that sense, Sudan\u2019s revolution, like all revolutions, was not only against one regime, but many. It took aim at the corrupt legacies and arrangements that were manifested in a single dictator \u2013 Bashir \u2013 who was vested with power by his large network of enablers. At every stage of the uprising since 2018, the Sudanese people have discovered another despot behind the despot. Behind Bashir stood a phalanx of generals who had come to power when many of the protesters on the streets had not even been born. Behind the generals was the mercenary army, and behind the mercenaries towered the allies of the counterrevolution, Sudan\u2019s allies in the Middle East and north Africa: Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt, which wanted to ensure democratic civilian rule never became a reality on their doorstep. Condemnation from the US and censure by the UN merely bounces off the iron realpolitik that sustains Sudan\u2019s coup.\nIn a way, it is a miracle that the Sudanese revolution succeeded at all, that it lasted a whole two years before the army moved once again. It is a testament to the number and indefatigability of the protesters, who kept spilling on to the streets in 2019. They not only removed Bashir, but dictated the shape of the transitional government that followed him. Millions of Sudanese people stared down the barrel of what seemed like certain failure, and persevered. Last week they did so again, taking to the streets in their millions to reject the coup and demand the return of the civilian government, and the release of many of its members, including the prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, who are in detention or house arrest. The Sudanese waited 30 years for a revolution, only for three to come at once. Last week, protesters were shot and beaten once again, and the dead and wounded fell on the streets of Sudan\u2019s cities. Once again, an anxious standoff is taking place between Sudan\u2019s people and an army and alliance of security forces that has only two choices: bend to the will of the Sudanese, or massacre them. The soldiers and military men think there might be a third option \u2013 to bide their time and hope that the protests run out of steam as the new military government settles in. That seems unlikely. But even if the coup prevails, it will be an uneasy win, enfeebled by constant policing and suppression of dissent. Civic resistance to the coup might appear frail when compared to the might of the generals and their backers, but the military is up against a people who are determined never again to be ruled by force. Their determination seems as limitless as the army\u2019s appetite for power.

Now sex makes me freeze", "article": "I am a man in my 30s and have recently admitted to myself that I cannot form an intimate sexual relationship. I am not, and never have been, interested in sex for its own sake; I want trust and intimacy even more than sex, although I hunger for both together. I have been close with potential partners many times, but each time I get to the point where the other person wants to progress to sex, I freeze and cannot carry on, until one of us breaks it off. I then hate myself for not following through yet again. I lost my virginity in my 20s with my first partner, whose sexual needs and energies far exceeded mine. We would have sex several times a week, or even several times a day when the occasion permitted, and I felt abused and trapped. I lost interest in him and could not perform in bed. I broke off the relationship quite soon, but he was very savage and took revenge by telling some of my friends about my failings as a lover. The pain and the shame of this exposure still haunt me. I try not to dwell on it, but how can I get past this endless cycle of failure? Your body is protecting you from psychological pain or harm, shutting down to stop you going through the motions of sex when you don\u2019t want it. This is often the case when a person cannot \u201cperform\u201d and it should never be seen as a failure. Healing from such a painful first experience with a partner takes time. It is important to recognise that your needs regarding true connection, trust and intimacy \u2013 and your distaste for \u201ccasual\u201d sex \u2013 are valid and important.

{"title": "Adieu gin, au revoir roast beef! How Hogarth became a proud European", "article": "In one of his most celebrated paintings, O the Roast Beef of Old England, William Hogarth appears as himself, sketching the fortifications at Calais at the very moment of being mistakenly arrested as a spy in 1748. It is not what you would call a subtle scene. The raggedy French soldiers are on their last legs, barely sustained by watery soup, while a gaggle of fishwives resemble the flounder they are selling from their tatty basket. There\u2019s a fat, greedy friar trying to get his hands on a sumptuous joint of beef which has just been unloaded and is on its way to one of the many English restaurants that thrive in Calais (only 200 years earlier the town had belonged to Britain). Spying, by implication, is not something that Britons resort to, although the figure of Hogarth busily sketching to one side is a warning not to dismiss John Bull as dense. The \u201cOld England\u201d Hogarth conjures up here is affluent, abundant and free. The French, meanwhile, are reduced to a series of humiliating stereotypes: silly, salacious and in thrall to the absolutist Roman Catholic church (you can just make out some gorgeously attired priests and abasing peasants in the background).\nIt is easy to see why Hogarth is so often positioned as the founding father of a particular strand of art which is essentially British: figurative, storytelling and not afraid to poke fun at itself. His most famous social satires including A Rake\u2019s Progress and Marriage A-la-Mode are often read as a cross between a Shakespearean comedy and a Carry On film, with more disguises, reversals of fortune, libidinous ladies and drunken lads than you can shake a bottle of gin at. However, Tate Britain\u2019s new exhibition Hogarth and Europe sets out to show that the artist was far from anyone\u2019s idea of a \u201clittle Englander\u201d. Rather, he saw himself, and was in turn seen, as a keen citizen of a rapidly globalising marketplace. Not only did Hogarth travel in Europe, but scores of Italian and French painters came to work in his native London, setting up powerful networks of cross-pollination, mutual support and occasional thievery. Even those artists who were happiest staying home were now able to keep a careful eye on the competition. Engraving, a technology that Hogarth embraced, allowed accurate copies of masterworks to circulate far and wide, creating a new virtual community of art workers.\nIn this new context, O the Roast Beef of Old England starts to read quite differently. In the luscious still-life details \u2013 especially that beautiful marbled beef \u2013 Hogarth\u2019s work owes a clear debt to Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, the French Academician whose work he had recently seen in Paris and whose luscious still lifes he knew so well. Then there\u2019s the way that Hogarth uses the recognisable topography of the gate of Calais as a framing device, which places his painting firmly in the emerging genre of city views, currently being brought to perfection by Canaletto who was living and working in London. Recent scholarship, meanwhile, has revealed that Hogarth\u2019s savage anti-Catholic imagery was borrowed from his many Huguenot friends, French Protestant refugees who had fled religious persecution to London. The figure of the fat, greedy friar was modelled by Hogarth\u2019s old friend and master engraver John Pine, a man believed to be of African descent, one of the 3% of London\u2019s population that was black at the time. Finally, the reason Hogarth\u2019s Old England picture achieved such saturation was thanks to the way it was reproduced on punchbowls and vases painted in China for the English market. By setting Hogarth\u2019s work alongside his European contemporaries Chardin, Pietro Longhi, Cornelis Troost (sometimes called \u201cthe Dutch Hogarth\u201d), Giuseppe Crespi and Nicolas Lancret, the Tate curators are hoping for unexpected connections, echoes and even dust-ups. A case in point: when the Venetian painter Jacopo Amigoni won the job of decorating the stairs in the new buildings for St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital in London in 1730s, Hogarth bustled in and insisted on doing the job without payment. There was a limit to how friendly one could be expected to be towards the competition. What bound these men together, and occasionally led to them falling out, was their shared understanding of what it meant to be an artist in this modern world. \u201cHogarth and his contemporaries were the first creative freelancers,\u201d explains co-curator Martin Myrone. \u201cArtists were no longer bound to royal or aristocratic patronage, but were free to set up on their own.\u201d (The same went for musicians such as the Mozart family who toured Britain under their own steam, rather than at the behest of king or empress). Gradually new spaces opened up for independent artists and their studios. In London it was Long Acre, in Paris the Rue St-Jacques. Commercial neighbourhoods now took the place of royal courts and elite academies in the role of building relations between clients, suppliers and the artists themselves.\nNo one was better poised to take advantage of these shifts than Hogarth, who was born in London in 1697. His hopeless father aspired to be a man of letters but ended up imprisoned for debt after the failure of a coffee shop in which the customers were required to speak Latin. Young William was initially apprenticed to a silver-plate engraver but soon broke from his master \u2013 something that would have been professional suicide only 50 years earlier \u2013 to set up as an independent copperplate engraver producing book illustrations, tickets and trade cards. Hogarth\u2019s trajectory as a self-published artist carved out new routes to financial success and creative independence. What\u2019s more, his written reflections on the art world combined with his determination to ensure artists\u2019 copyright (successfully made law in 1735), showed a keen sense of how creative workers needed to protect themselves from commercial exploitation and risk. All this comes across in his famous self-portrait The Painter and His Pug. X-rays have revealed that Hogarth started off painting himself as an artist in the grand manner, with a wig and formal coat with gold buttons. Around 1745, possibly following a trip to Paris, he dramatically changed direction and showed himself as a working professional in an informal jacket and cap. He even includes his scar. The way he emphasises the similarities between his own smudgy, snub-nosed face and that of his pug puts one in mind of Lucian Freud\u2019s paintings in which human and animal bodies are placed on a continuum. And the fact that Hogarth chooses to be painted with a pug \u2013 a Dutch breed that originated from China \u2013 cuts across any sense of him as a bluff patriot who would only pose with a British bulldog. Hogarth brought this same enlarged sense of selfhood to his portraits of women. Until now it was only princesses and empresses who were painted, their bodies used as fleshy Christmas trees on which to dangle the symbols of their husbands\u2019 wealth. But Hogarth does something quite different, intent on searching for what makes a woman her own person. His most famous painting is of Miss Mary Edwards, an heiress who inherited about \u00a38m in today\u2019s money, at the age of 23. She married a nobleman called Lord Anne Hamilton (his Christian name makes the whole thing even more intriguing) who agreed to take her name. But when Lord Anne started running through Mary\u2019s fortune she insisted on a separation and managed to prove that her marriage was invalid, despite making her son illegitimate in the process. In this portrait, not seen in Britain for a 100 years, Hogarth shows Mary surrounded with the symbols of a genderless independence: a gun dog, a celestial globe, portrait busts of Alfred the Great and papers which include a proclamation of individual rights. She gazes fearlessly at the viewer, a new woman for a new world.\nThat same marked sense of individuality is apparent when Hogarth paints his sisters. Subjectivity was no longer the sole preserve of the rich and the aristocratic but could be embodied by middle-class women too. His pictures of Mary and Anne are not glamour portraits but accurate likenesses, instantly recognisable as his siblings by their snub noses and soft jaws. The women have the tough wary faces that come from being brought up with a spendthrift father. They know what it is to go out to work \u2013 together they run a children\u2019s clothing shop \u2013 and they know how much money is enough. Equally striking are Hogarth\u2019s portraits of his servants whom he draws as individuals, rather than \u201ctypes\u201d. The Tate curators suggest that Hogarth may well have been inspired by images in Jean-Antoine Watteau\u2019s sketchbook, in which the French artist, normally associated with whimsical f\u00eates galantes, practises drawing people of African descent. While the Tate show is eye-opening in the way it repositions Hogarth the bluff patriot as a knowing European, it would be quite wrong, Myrone says, to call him a revolutionary. The progressive left has always had much invested in Hogarth as a class warrior and fearless critic of developing capitalism. Narratives including A Harlot\u2019s Progress and Marriage A-la-Mode offer a fierce critique of men and women debased by their new appetites for gin and sex, but above all for the piles of stuff \u2013 silk shawls, cones of sugar, showy geegaws \u2013 that were pouring into Britain as a result of its developing empire. But to suggest Hogarth hated capitalism would be as misleading as insisting on him as a proto-Brexiteer. His first loyalty remained always to himself. In 1757 he was delighted to take over the role of Serjeant Painter to the king from his brother-in-law, much as his closest European ally Chardin happily accepted a state pension. The Hogarth who emerges from this exhibition is neither saint nor sinner, left or right, but a modern artist who knew at any given moment where his best interests lay in a rapidly changing world. \u2022 Hogarth and Europe is at Tate Britain, Millbank, London SW1, from 3 November to 20 March 2022.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/02/gin-roast-beef-hogarth-proud-european-tate-britain-europe", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:27:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},

But while the Seattle police union warned that the mandate would lead to \u201can alarming escalation in crime\u201d and \u201can untenable public safety crisis\u201d, Huserik said the department\u2019s staffing strategy had allowed it to continue to properly respond to 911 calls. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a significant need for detectives to be donning their uniforms and heading out and handling 911 calls,\u201d Huserik said. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few [people] here and there.\u201d Cities around the US have implemented similar mandates \u2013 and faced the same sort of backlash from police unions who have predicted chaos \u2013 but the warnings that the mandates would deplete police departments and make cities more dangerous have not yet proven true, according to policing and public health experts. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises police departments across the country, described the warnings from police unions as \u201cbravado\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t asking cops to work extra hours without getting compensated,\u201d said Wexler. \u201cThis is about a public health emergency, and this isn\u2019t about taking away rights. This is about protecting cops from dying\u201d from Covid, which has killed almost 500 officers in the United States over the last two years, about five times the number who died from gunfire, according to the non-profit Officer Down Memorial Page.\nOn Monday, New York began enforcing its vaccinate mandate for city employees, which meant about 9,000 people who refused to get the vaccine were placed on unpaid leave, representing about 6% of the city workforce, according to NPR. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that 91% of city employees had been vaccinated, the New York Times reported. That included the New York police department, the largest in the country, in which 85% of officers have been vaccinated, up from 70% just a couple of weeks ago. Other cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, have seen the same increase in vaccinations before mandate deadlines, as workers decide they would rather get the shot than lose their jobs or be placed on unpaid leave. In Seattle, 92% of the police department is fully vaccinated, according to the city. Twenty-two employees are partially vaccinated, and 100 others have requested an exemption. To combat the staffing shortfall, Seattle\u2019s mayor, Jenny Durkan, announced last week that the city would begin offering a $25,000 hiring bonus to experienced officers or 911 dispatchers. \u201cWe are encouraged by the mayor\u2019s support because we have been pursuing hiring incentives,\u201d Huserik said. But Mike Solan, president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, condemned Durkan\u2019s announcement, telling Fox News that she had already betrayed police officers by implementing the vaccine mandate and not supporting them during protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020. Despite the fierce battles over vaccine mandates, public health experts say they are effective. \u201cAs the deadline for the mandate gets closer, even people who said initially they are not going to get the vaccine, they begin to move and do get vaccinated,\u201d said Sandra C Quinn, a professor of family science at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who has studied the role of communication in vaccine acceptance. Adam Galinsky, a social psychologist and expert in leadership and ethics at Columbia University, said the last-minute decisions to get vaccinated could be attributed to people\u2019s tendency to avoid actions they might later regret. With a mandate, the decision is somewhat taken out of their hands. \u201cMandates work \u2013 especially mandates around public health,\u201d Galinsky said. \u201cEven when people whine \u2026 and say they are going to quit, most people don\u2019t.\u201d Despite the uptick due to the mandates, some public health experts worry about the long-term consequences of the requirements on healthcare and society, including potentially greater opposition to other vaccines, said Katrin Schmelz, a behavioral economist and psychologist at the University of Konstanz. \u201cVaccination mandates will increase vaccination rates and on the other side of the scale, it could increase hostility towards the government and aggression and affect compliance with other Covid measures,\u201d said Schmelz, who lives in Germany, which does not mandate Covid vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s not just: we enforce [the mandate] and are on the safe side, and all the problems are solved.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/02/police-vaccine-mandate-protest", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:05:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Mission impossible? How Nuno\u2019s Spurs tenure fell apart in four months | Fabrizio Romano", "article": "The end was very quick but it had been coming for a long time, maybe even since the day Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was appointed as Tottenham manager. It was clear to everyone that he was fifth-choice at best, hired after attempts to lure Antonio Conte, Mauricio Pochettino, Paulo Fonseca and Gennaro Gattuso failed. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous pleasure and honour to be here,\u201d Nuno said on 30 June, when his appointment was announced, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s joy and I\u2019m happy and looking forward to starting work.\u201d But in the next four months there was very little joy or happiness. After a promising start \u2013 albeit through some fairly lacklustre football \u2013 with three wins in three league games, it imploded faster than anyone could have predicted.\nIn the day-to-day business Nuno never won over the players. There were no personal clashes as such. It was more that his way of dealing with things did not work with this group; his character did not fit. He never got into the heart of this squad. It is possible that Spurs\u2019 botched attempts at hiring so many other managers before Nuno played into this. The fact that he was given a two-year contract was also a sign that Tottenham did not quite believe in him \u2013 so why should the players?\nNuno was acutely aware of this and it did not take long before things came to a head. The end of the transfer window was a huge let-down for the former Wolves manager, who had wanted a midfielder and a back-up forward to support Harry Kane. The fact that neither arrived proved to Nuno what he knew deep down: that he was a stopgap. At the same time the club grew more and more frustrated with his tactics and some of his selections. The game against Arsenal towards the end of September was a disaster, Spurs looking rudderless as they fell to a 3-1 defeat. Nuno was endearingly honest afterwards. \u201cThe performance was not good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gameplan was not good. I take responsibility because the decisions were not right.\u201d One such defeat was bad enough but when a second arrived against Manchester United on Saturday \u2013 a team that had just lost heavily to Liverpool and were low on confidence \u2013 it was too much for the chairman, Daniel Levy, and managing director of football, Fabio Paratici.\nThey already knew in their hearts that Nuno was not the long-term solution but had planned to give him more time to turn things round. They knew that he had not inherited an easy situation with Kane wanting to leave and below par at the end of the previous season. But the nature of the performance against United prompted them to meet on the Sunday to discuss the situation. There was anger over the display and the attitude of some players but also over some of Nuno\u2019s tactical decisions, such as replacing Lucas Moura with Steven Bergwijn in the 54th minute. The meeting lasted more than five hours and it was decided that Nuno and his coaching team had to go. One reason was that Paratici, soon after the game, had made contact with Antonio Conte, the man they wanted to replace Nuno. It had been felt that convincing Conte to take the Spurs job would be akin to mission impossible, especially as he had turned them down in the summer. But Paratici had one main advantage \u2013 he had worked with Conte before.\nThey were at Juventus from 2011 to 2014 with excellent results, winning the league every season and having a shared approach to football and recruitment. Conte had previously been considering only the Manchester United job in the event that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was sacked but phone calls to Conte and his advisers on Saturday night changed that. The talks continued throughout Sunday, Paratici trying to convince the former Chelsea manager that the Spurs project was worth buying into: the same project he had turned down in June. This time they offered him more decision-making power when it comes to signings in January and next summer and, most importantly, that this Tottenham will be made by Antonio Conte \u2013 and no one else.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/how-nuno-spurs-tenure-fell-apart-in-four-months", "last_update": "2021-11-02T09:01:42Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Child labor laws in some states may be weakened as US industries look to hire teens", "article": "US employers are recruiting teenaged workers to solve their difficulties in hiring and retaining workers, and some Republicans and industry groups are pushing for looser child labor laws to allow those industries to put teens to work for longer hours. Businesses around the United States that have advertised hiring 14- and 15-year-olds through the pandemic\u2019s \u201clabor shortage\u201d include several restaurants in Pennsylvania, a Pumpkin Patch in Liberty, Missouri, a Burger King in Ohio, and a McDonald\u2019s in Oregon. Employers such as Chipotle have expanded recruiting efforts this year to target younger workers. Other restaurants and employers such as amusement parks and seasonal businesses around the US have touted their reliance on teenage workers under 18 as a labor shortage solution. A restaurant in Arkansas, noting it had struggled to hire and retain workers, recently offered to pay its teen workers for one hour to do homework before their shift. Teenage employment in the US surged to more than 32% in summer 2021, the highest level since 2008, and for the first time in history the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds fell below the rate for 20- to 24-year-olds. In a recent op-ed for a local Pennsylvania newspaper, Darcy Leight, a junior in high school, argued the claims of labor shortages and staffing issues in the food service, recreation and tourism industry had driven teenagers to work more and longer hours past summer employment periods. \u201cA job I intended to work strictly during the summer has somehow found its way into my fall schedule and has become almost equivalent to academics on my priority list. And I don\u2019t even know how it happened,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe coupling of a job anywhere from five to 35 hours a week along with being a student is extremely stressful.\u201d The labor shortage concerns have galvanized an effort by some elected officials \u2013 mostly Republicans \u2013 to scale back some child labor regulations. Three Republicans and one Democrat in the Ohio state senate have recently introduced a bill to expand the hours minors under the age of 16 are permitted to work in the state, from 7pm to 9pm during the school year with a parent or guardian\u2019s permission. In Wisconsin, Republican state senators recently approved a bill, SB332, and sent it to the Wisconsin state assembly. The bill would expand permissible work hours for minors under the age of 16. Supporters of the bill, which include Republican legislators, the Wisconsin Restaurant Association and other industry groups, have argued the bill could help small businesses that are experiencing hiring and staff retention issues amid some industries experiencing labor shortages throughout 2021. Under current law, minors are permitted to work from 7am to 7pm from labor day to 31 May and 7am to 9pm from 1 June to labor day. The bill would expand those times and dates from 6am to 9.30pm on a day preceding a school day and 6am to 11pm on a day preceding a non-school day, and expand weekly hours from three hours during a school week to 18 hours. Wisconsin Republicans have successfully passed several bills in the last decade to weaken child labor laws, including in 2011 eliminating limits on the number of hours and days minors, ages 16 and 17, could work, eliminating work permits for 16 and 17-year-olds, and replacing all uses of the term \u201cchild labor\u201d in state employment statutes with the term \u201cemployment of minors\u201d in 2017.\n\u201cThe passage of this bill would be a slippery slope for eliminating child labor practices in Wisconsin and in the United States in general,\u201d said Stephanie Bloomingdale, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, which opposes SB332. \u201cYoung teenagers need to have good work experiences that help them to learn work ethics and valuable skills, but at the same time, recognizing they also are kids that need time to study, to sleep and to prepare their minds for their future.\u201d Reports of labor shortages have received significant coverage throughout 2021, with employers and industry groups often blaming unemployment benefits for difficulties in finding enough workers, though ending unemployment benefits did not result in a mass influx of Americans returning to work. Several solutions that employers have turned to amid labor shortage concerns through 2021 include prison labor, recently released prisoners and immigrant visa programs. Labor groups and workers have characterized the labor issues as a result of low wages, Covid-19 safety concerns, rampant poor working conditions and a lack of childcare and paid sick leave throughout the US. \u201cThe notion that we would be solving some economic turmoil by allowing the expansion of child labor hours, is at best, ridiculous, and at worst, very detrimental to young people,\u201d said Debra Cronmiller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin. Scientific research has shown working long hours while attending high school can have negative academic and behavioral impacts on teenagers. Dr Kathryn C Monahan, a psychologist who researched the impact of work on adolescents while at the University of Washington, explained much of the research on adolescent employment has focused on formal types of employment that generally occurs at age 16 and above. \u201cWhat this bill does, I think, is it opens up and it encourages young teens to enter into that workforce,\u201d said Monahan. She noted a lack of scientific research on how work affects teens this young, and what impact earning income at such a young age may have on other negative behaviors, such as dropping out of high school and substance abuse. \u201cThe second thing that concerns me about this is the sleep issue,\u201d Monahan added. \u201c I can imagine the kid getting home later on a school night \u2026 because that\u2019s when that child uses that time for homework, for catching up with friends, and so you\u2019re going to get an even further delay out in terms of sleep, while school is going to stay constant in terms of those really early wake up times.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/nov/02/child-labor-laws-weakened-us-industries-teens", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:49:01Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "China accused of blocking media access to Winter Olympics", "article": "Chinese authorities have been accused of \u201ccontinuously stymying\u201d attempts by foreign media to cover the Winter Olympics, by denying or ignoring requests for access and following, harassing and abusing journalists. In a scathing statement on Tuesday, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which acts on behalf of foreign media in China, called for transparency and clarity from China\u2019s national Olympic organising committee. The club also accused the committee of failing to uphold the International Olympic Committee\u2019s charter requiring it to ensure the fullest media coverage possible for the widest global audience. The Games are due to take place in Beijing in February. \u201cOur members\u2019 repeated inquiries towards [Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games] on how international media can report on the Games have been met with conflicting answers or neglected completely,\u201d the FCCC said. \u201cFCCC members report spending weeks trying to obtain contact details for BOCOG media facilitators, only to receive dismissive or inaccurate information from them.\u201d The FCCC said in the past year foreign journalists had been largely unable to access press conferences or events that were open to domestic media, including the arrival of the Olympic flame. It said many press dates were not publicised, or announced with only a few hours\u2019 notice. \u201cForeign journalists who attempt to register for events are denied because BOCOG limits attendance to only their chosen media outlets, claim the event is full, or because they require participants to submit Covid test results within an impossible timeframe of only a few hours.\u201d The FCCC provided several testimonies, including from a US journalist who said they were stopped and questioned by police after they tried to take photos with their phone of a venue, from a public road. Another broadcaster said it was called by an organiser of an Olympic venue tour and shouted at over a report that mentioned human rights boycotts. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been given access since,\u201d the broadcaster said. A European newspaper reporter who attempted to visit venues after BOCOG failed to grant access was stopped at the entrance to winter sports slopes in Chongli and Yanqing. \u201cThis lack of access means Chinese state media claims about the environmental sustainability of venues are impossible to verify,\u201d the reporter said. The FCCC said the conditions for visiting accredited foreign journalists were also unclear, including whether they would be allowed to travel within and outside Beijing, and what quarantine measures were required of them. China is committed to a zero-Covid strategy and has enacted a \u201cclosed loop\u201d management system for the Games, within which all participants and employees can only move between Games-related venues for training, competitions and work on a dedicated transport system. China\u2019s relationship with international media has plummeted in recent years. Many in-country positions \u2013 including for major outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, and all Australian outlets \u2013 remain empty after Beijing expelled or forced out dozens of reporters in 2020. It has since processed very few visa applications for journalists outside China hoping to go in, and dozens remain outstanding, leaving outlets with inadequate teams to cover the event. The FCC called on the BOCOG to provide transparency and clarity for international media, process outstanding visas, improve access and permission to press events and venues, and to appoint dedicated media communications officers who provide real assistance. \u201cWith less than three months remaining before the start of Beijing 2022, there is still tremendous uncertainty over how and if foreign correspondents will be able to cover the Games,\u201d the FCCC said.

{"title": "Melbourne Cup loses some shine with crowds trending downwards as animal welfare concerns rise", "article": "The Melbourne Cup\u2019s reputation may be a little scratched but plenty of Australians still like to give it a trot. Attendances at meetings have been dwindling and fewer Australians are gambling on horse races \u2013 but those still having a punt are spending more. The Australian Hotels Association, meanwhile, has reported that pubs and restaurants are doing a roaring trade. A major report released by Gambling Research Australia in October found 16.8% of Australians gambled on horse races in the past year, down from 22.4% a decade before. But turnover keeps increasing, from $22.9bn in 2010-11 to $26.9bn in 2018-19 (adjusted for inflation). CQUniversity senior postdoctoral fellow in the experimental gambling research laboratory, and co-author of the report, Dr Alex Russell, says the apparent discrepancy is due to people turning off gambling, but those left behind being the heavy gamblers.\n\u201cThe people who are still betting are betting a tonne,\u201d Russell said. \u201cA lot of that is driven by more and more online gambling \u2013 it doubled in the past decade.\u201d Russell said people have realised that gambling is not just a harmless recreational activity but something with damaging effects on people and animals. \u201cWe\u2019re just seeing more and more people saying \u2018I bloody hate gambling\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m sick of all the ads\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing about the Melbourne Cup and horse racing is it comes with the animal cruelty issue.\u201d There have been seven horse deaths in the past six years at the big race, prompting Racing Victoria to introduce new safety measures. Animal rights protesters targeted it again this year, joined \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 by anti-lockdown activists. In an article in The Conversation, Russell pointed to an analysis of Melbourne Cup tweets last year that had #nuptothecup, #horseracingkills and #animalcruelty in the top 10. Attendances at the Cup were steadily declining before Covid changed everything. From a high of 122,736 (when Makybe Diva won in 2003), the numbers hovered at just over 100,000 in the early 2010s before sinking to 83,471 in 2018 then 81,408 in 2019. Covid meant there were no spectators last year and a cap of 10,000 people this year. Television audiences have also been declining, the Nine papers reported last year, although Channel 10 said people were live-streaming the event instead. Gerard Daffy from online sports betting site TAB said the cup might have \u201clost a bit of its gloss\u201d, blaming an increasing number of international entries. But, thanks to the pandemic, Australians are dominating again. He said Incentivise (the pre-race favourite who came second behind Verry Elleegant) was a \u201cheadline act \u2026 a horse from Queensland that\u2019s come from obscurity\u201d. \u201cThe Melbourne Cup\u2019s the Melbourne Cup,\u201d Daffy said. \u201cIt\u2019s the race that stops the nation, it truly does, and it always will.\u201d\nThe Australian Hotels Association chief executive officer, Stephen Ferguson, said while race-day crowds were on \u201can inchingly slow decline\u201d, pubs and restaurants had held their ground. That was true this year, bearing in mind capacity restrictions, he said. \u201cThe Melbourne Cup is the starting gun for the run into Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always is. It\u2019s one of the biggest days of the year. It\u2019s a festive day, full of bookings. People are social animals, they\u2019re looking to get out there and connect. Who wants to get on a train to Flemington when you can sit in a pub?\u201d Russell said for many people, Melbourne Cup betting was just a once-yearly bit of fun. \u201cIt\u2019s an excuse to take the day off, go to the pub, get dressed up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still got that about it, but a lot of people have had their eyes opened to all the stuff around it.\u201d In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858.

{"title": "Morrison accused of worsening rift with French government after leak of Macron text", "article": "Scott Morrison has been accused of putting his personal political interests ahead of healing Australia\u2019s diplomatic rift with France, after the leaking of a text message from Emmanuel Macron to the prime minister. The release of a text received two days before the Aukus announcement \u2013 when the French president asked Morrison whether to expect good or bad news on the submarine project \u2013 was \u201chighly unconventional behaviour between state leaders\u201d, a leading foreign affairs analyst said. The Morrison government also pushed back at the US government on Tuesday, with the defence minister, Peter Dutton, saying Australia\u2019s key security ally was \u201ckept informed of our every move\u201d in a \u201cno-surprises strategy\u201d in the lead up to the deal between the two countries and the UK.\nThe Australian newspaper on Tuesday reported details of a 15-page confidential agreed communications timeline that the article said undermined claims by the US president, Joe Biden, that he did not know Australia had not informed France earlier about the cancellation of the French submarine contract. The extraordinary rift between Australia and France flows from Macron\u2019s accusation that Morrison lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines. Morrison rejected the claim and said he was \u201cnot going to cop sledging of Australia\u201d. Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph and the Australian Financial Review reported Macron had texted Morrison two days before the Aukus announcement in mid-September to say: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d\nThe leaked message \u2013 shared to reinforce Australia\u2019s position that France wasn\u2019t blindsided about the cancellation of the A$90bn submarine deal \u2013 also appeared to confirm Macron did not know which way Australia would go shortly before Aukus was unveiled. It was also reported Macron told Morrison in June, \u201cI don\u2019t like losing,\u201d after the Australian prime minister raised concern in Paris about whether the 12 planned conventionally powered submarines were still suitable for Australia\u2019s strategic needs. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLabor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said Morrison was \u201cwilling to trash alliances and partnerships for personal political interests, instead of simply admitting this could have been handled better\u201d. \u201cMr Morrison needs to explain how selective text messages between him and the French president, and the contents of a confidential 15-page document negotiated in secret between President Biden\u2019s National Security Council and Australian and British officials ended up in Australian newspapers,\u201d Wong said. \u201cMr Morrison needs to rule out that this backgrounding came from him, his office or his government. His furious attempts at damage control will only make world leaders trust him less.\u201d Morrison\u2019s office on Tuesday declined to respond to Wong\u2019s comments, pointing to the prime minister\u2019s comments a day earlier.\nMorrison was asked in Glasgow on Monday: \u201cWhy did you decide to leak that text message?\u201d The prime minister did not directly contest the claim, but said he didn\u2019t intend to \u201cindulge your editorial on that\u201d. Morrison told reporters Macron \u201cwas concerned that this would be a phone call that would result in the decision of Australia not to proceed with the contract\u201d. Morrison said the French defence system \u201cflew into action\u201d the day after his dinner with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in June to seek to address issues with the project \u2013 including sending a French admiral to Australia \u201cto try and save the contract\u201d. The French embassy in Canberra did not comment on the release of the text message, although the ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, is due to address the National Press Club on Wednesday.\nComment has also been sought from the US embassy and the White House. Earlier, a senior White House official declined to clarify who Biden was referring to when he told Macron in Rome last week: \u201cI was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through. I, honest to God, did not know you had not been.\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan \u2013 when asked on Monday about Morrison\u2019s handling of the matter \u2013 replied: \u201cWe should look forward and not backward.\u201d Herv\u00e9 Lemahieu, the research director at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, said Australia had every right to decide to rescind the French contract and to enter into Aukus, but the communication with France \u201ccould have been handled with a bit more deft and diplomacy\u201d. Lemahieu said the alleged release of the texts was \u201chighly unconventional behaviour between state leaders\u201d and reflected \u201chow personalised the squabble has become\u201d. \u201cI think the key variable here is that both president Macron and prime minister Morrison are two men who face elections in 2022, and they both see the fracas as a blow to their prestige and their personal standing and they are primarily speaking to a domestic audience here, rather than to each other.\u201d Lemahieu said he had been monitoring French news stories in recent days \u201cand this is a bigger story in Australia than it is in France\u201d.\nHe said the handling of the communications with France was \u201cas much an American mismanagement as an Australian one\u201d \u2013 as the US is a formal treaty ally of France. Lemahieu said Biden had \u201cbasically decided that it was worth pushing Australia under the bus in order to salvage\u201d the US relationship with France. The former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 who announced the partnership with France to acquire submarines in 2016 \u2013 said Morrison \u201cshould apologise\u201d to Macron \u201cbecause he did very elaborately and duplicitously deceive France\u201d. The former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd said the situation had become an \u201cextraordinary mess\u201d where \u201cwe now have got heads of government, effectively, leaking against each other, in order to establish what transpired in these informal text messages between heads of government\u201d. \u201cMr Morrison is now digging an even bigger hole for himself, not just in relation to the French, by effectively himself accusing the French president of lying, but also (in) extraordinary background briefing about the failure in Mr Morrison\u2019s view of American officials to properly apprise the United States president of the nature of the cancellation of the French deal,\u201d Rudd told the ABC.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/morrison-accused-of-worsening-rift-with-french-government-after-leak-of-macron-text", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:56:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Barclays\u2019 multibillion pound support for fossil fuel projects was ranked ahead of that of HSBC, which financed $5.3bn this year, and Standard Chartered, which made $4.3bn available. The report found Barclays financed a $194m bond to the Canada-headquartered pipeline company Enbridge, which part-owns the controversial Dakota access pipeline which is expected to carry enough crude oil to produce the emissions of 30 coal plants every year. It also said the bank provided $200m to MEG Energy, which extracts Canadian tar sands oil, one of the most polluting fuels on the planet. The report also revealed how HSBC and Standard Chartered participated in a $6bn bond issuance to Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most polluting company, and that HSBC financed a $1.5bn bond to Qatar Petroleum, which owns the world\u2019s biggest gas field. The three banks have extended financing to fossil fuel companies despite committing to net zero carbon emissions from financing activity by 2050 and issuing warnings that no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with keeping global heating in check. The report\u2019s findings came ahead of a series of Cop26 events scheduled for Wednesday that are intended to mobilise public and private finance to help tackle the climate emergency.\nMia Watanabe, a campaigner at Market Forces, said: \u201cDespite their warm words, these banks continue to finance fossil fuel companies and projects that are destroying the world\u2019s hopes of meeting climate targets.\u201d In a stunt to mark the latest report, Market Forces held a Formula One-style \u201cprize giving\u201d for the banks\u2019 \u201crace to disaster\u201d outside Barclays\u2019 Glasgow offices, which is a stone\u2019s throw from the Cop26 venue. A previous annual report by the group that tracked global fossil fuel financing found that in the five years after the signing of the Paris agreement, the three banks combined financed more than $257bn in the coal, oil and gas sectors. That report found Barclays was the world\u2019s seventh-biggest fossil fuel funder, and the biggest in Europe, while HSBC was ranked 13th in the world. Although Standard Chartered trailed at 34 globally, it is also the top UK financier of new coal plants in Asia, according to Market Forces.\nThe latest report follow news that Jes Staley has stepped down as the chief executive of Barclays after an investigation by City regulators into how he described his relationship with the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Standard Chartered said last week that it would set \u201cambitious new targets\u201d to reach net zero from financed activity by 2050, including interim 2030 targets for the most carbon-intensive sectors, that were aligned with the International Energy Agency\u2019s scenario for a net zero energy system by 2050. The global energy watchdog said in May that there could be no new oil, gas or coal development if the world was to reach net zero by 2050. Only days later a UN report warned that fossil fuel production planned by the world\u2019s governments \u201cvastly\u201d exceeded the limit needed to keep the rise in global heating to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cThe science is clear \u2013 banks that keep funding fossil fuels can\u2019t be climate leaders,\u201d Watanabe added. A spokesperson for Barclays was not immediately available to comment. A HSBC spokesperson said the bank was \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to aligning its provision of finance to net zero by 2050 or sooner. \u201cWe have committed to phase out thermal coal financing by 2030 in EU and OECD markets and by 2040 globally and to set out short and medium-term transition targets for the oil and gas and power and utilities sector. We expect to provide between $750bn and $1trn towards the net zero-transition by 2030,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/barclays-has-financed-56bn-in-new-fossil-fuel-projects-since-january-cop26", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:03:44Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018L\u2019affaire des sous-marins\u2019: how French media reacted to Morrison and Macron dispute ", "article": "Debate has reignited over how well (or not) Australia handled the September announcement of the Aukus pact \u2013 and its subsequent withdrawal from a lucrative French submarine contract. While the French government claims it was blindsided by the move, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, maintains he acted appropriately and in the country\u2019s national interests. Ahead of the G20 summit in Rome, the US president, Joe Biden, publicly observed to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the episode had been \u201cclumsy\u201d. On Sunday night, as the forum drew to a close, journalists asked Macron if he thought Morrison had lied to him about the plan. \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know,\u201d he replied. On Monday, with leaders now gathered for Cop26 in Glasgow, Morrison shot back, telling reporters he refused to \u201ccop sledging of Australia\u201d.\nBut while the diplomatic row has dominated headlines in Australia, French media have not so far showed much interest in the matter. \u201cLa crise des sous-marins\u201d seems to be largely a footnote when discussing deteriorating US or cross-channel relations. On Friday, after Biden said he had been \u201cunder the impression that France had been informed\u201d, Le Monde called his claim \u201csomewhat astonishing\u201d.\nCommentators on the Fox News-style CNews this week referred to the broken submarine contract as a \u201chumiliation\u201d, a \u201cdiplomatic thrashing\u201d, and proof of US disregard for France. On Monday morning, Le Parisien\u2019s report noted principally that the incident \u201csparked a quarrel with the US\u201d. On Monday afternoon, financial journal Les Echos referenced the submarine debate as a sign of London\u2019s \u201cperfidy\u201d and desire to make trouble for Europe \u2013 but made no mention of Australia. On Monday night, Ouest-France reported on Morrison\u2019s stand without further analysis. One French commentator did notice how \u201cfurious\u201d the prime minister was over Macron\u2019s accusation.\nBut with Cop26 under way, Morrison\u2019s comments otherwise got little attention in the French press. Television network BFMTV noted that Australia\u2019s \u201ctorpedoing\u201d of the contract had strained France\u2019s relations with the UK, aggravating tensions over the fishing licences \u2013 but otherwise made no mention of Morrison. \u2018Frexit\u2019 champion Fran\u00e7ois Asselineau has meanwhile suggested Biden lied to Macron \u2013 that Morrison\u2019s comments indicate \u201cBiden was obviously fully informed\u201d that France had not been kept in the loop.\nWhile French outlets were somewhat restrained, News Corp Australia tabloids went to town: \u201cPM\u2019s fury at French whine\u201d the Herald Sun\u2019s headline read, while the Daily Telegraph went with \u201cThe frog of war\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/laffaire-des-sous-marins-how-french-media-reacted-to-morrison-and-macron-dispute", "last_update": "2021-11-02T06:57:38Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Salty language: why are UK and France fighting over fishing licences?", "article": "Britain and France have been at loggerheads over post-Brexit fishing licences for UK waters since the start of the year. Talks are continuing but both sides have threatened action \u2013 and mistranslations have not helped. What\u2019s at the heart of the row? Under the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), French fishers may continue to fish between six and 12 miles from the UK shore and off Guernsey and Jersey until 2026 if they have a discretionary licence issued by Britain. To be granted that licence, they must have previously fished in those waters between 2012 and 2016 \u2013 but the two countries disagree over the evidence required for past activity, and how much of it should be needed. France says that for the six-to-12-mile zone and off Guernsey and Jersey, 210 licences have so far been granted whereas it requested 454. Authorities say only about 20 of Boulogne\u2019s 112-strong fleet are permitted to fish in that zone. The UK says it has granted about 1,700 licences, or 98% of EU applications. But that figure includes licences to fish in Britain\u2019s exclusive economic zone between 12 and 200 miles from the coast, which were automatic under the terms of the TCA. The nub of the argument is that in the disputed zones (six-to-12 miles, and around Jersey and Guernsey), the TCA defines which boats qualify for licences through their past activity \u2013 but it does not specify exactly what proof is required. What are both sides threatening? France says the rules imposed by the UK, Jersey and Guernsey are unfair to smaller boats, which typically do not have the GPS equipment to prove past presence in UK waters. Britain says it is entitled to ask for the evidence it wants. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called on Monday for further talks, lifting a threat to ban UK boats from unloading at some French ports, carry out extra licence checks, tighten controls of trucks and reinforce customs and hygiene controls from Tuesday. Both sides seem to believe the other has \u2013 or is about to \u2013 breach the terms of the TCA. France\u2019s Europe minister, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, said on Sunday that the UK had failed to issue a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of licences and was \u201ctargeting one country\u201d. This was \u201cnot a technical issue, it\u2019s a political choice and a breach of the TCA\u201d, he said. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday gave France 48 hours to withdraw its \u201ccompletely unreasonable\u201d threats, warning that the UK could otherwise \u201cuse the mechanisms of our trade agreement with the EU to take action\u201d. What happens next? It depends how talks go, what, if any, measures France implements, and how the UK chooses to respond, but either or both parties could enter the TCA dispute settlement process. This would entail first going into consultations, then, if those fail, triggering arbitration. If one side is found to have breached TCA, it must comply with the ruling within a reasonable period or risk the winning side withdrawing TCA benefits. Given the rhetoric from both sides, and the domestic political advantage to be won from playing tough, it is hard to see a rapid de-escalation. There may be little appetite in the EU27 for a fish war, but there is also a sense Britain is pushing its luck too often. Matters have also not been helped by mistranslations. Boris Johnson on Sunday cited a letter from the French prime minister, Jean Castex, to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, which he said called on the EU to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain. Other reports said the letter asked the EU to \u201ccause damage\u201d to the UK. The phrase might be better translated as: \u201cIt is vital to show European public opinion that respect for commitments entered into is not negotiable, and that it is more detrimental to leave the EU than to remain in it.\u201d The point was unfortunately phrased, but has been made by many EU leaders since the Brexit referendum.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/why-are-uk-and-france-fighting-over-fishing-licences", "last_update": "2021-11-02T07:13:20Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "NSW premier rules out changing MP private phones rules until Icac releases Gladys Berejiklian report", "article": "The leaders of both major New South Wales parties won\u2019t commit to tightening rules around ministers\u2019 use of private phones until the state\u2019s anti-corruption body releases its report into the conduct of the former premier Gladys Berejiklian, which the watchdog says won\u2019t be until at least after February next year. On Tuesday the premier, Dominic Perrottet, told reporters he and many other MPs in NSW use a private phone to keep \u201cprofessional work separate\u201d from their private life. He was responding to questions in the wake of evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption that the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire urged Berejiklian to \u201cget a private phone\u201d after he was summonsed to appear before the body in 2018.\nIcac also heard Maguire told Berejiklian \u201cthey can read texts\u201d and suggested she download Chinese messaging app WeChat. Perrottet said on Tuesday he did not know about WeChat, but he was aware many MPs use WhatsApp for private communication. While Perrottet said it was \u201cimportant that information that is relevant to ministerial decision-making is conducted in accordance with rules that are in place\u201d, he stopped short of committing to changing the rules on the use of private communication methods including encrypted messaging apps. While Perrottet said he believed the NSW ministerial code of conduct was \u201cincredibly strong\u201d he also said the government would consider changes. But only if it came with a recommendation from Icac. \u201cIf [the ministerial code] needs to be [reviewed] from time to time, based on changes in technology, the government will always look at it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the important roles that Icac also play is in corruption prevention and providing advice to government, which they do from time to time on the changes [that] should be made and I would assume that would also include potential changes to the code of conduct.\u201d On the final day of its hearings into Berejiklian\u2019s conduct, the former NSW premier told the inquiry it was common for MPs to have private phones, and that she had often been encouraged to use one by colleagues. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, also stopped short of calling for changes to the code on the use of phones. \u201cAt the end of the day ministerial communication and communication on behalf of any member of parliament is subject to oversight by investigative bodies and I think every MP knows that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d wait for the Icac findings to come down before I make a policy change or recommend [one] to the NSW government but you know we\u2019re public officials and that needs to be at the forefront of our mind when we\u2019re making decisions.\u201d But those findings won\u2019t be made public for some months. On Tuesday the watchdog released a timetable saying submissions from the inquiry\u2019s counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, were not due until 20 December. The submissions in reply from lawyers for Berejiklian and Maguire were not due until 14 February 2022.\nIcac has been the subject of fierce criticism in some quarters over the timing of its inquiry into Berejiklian, which prompted her resignation as the state navigated the end of its long Covid-19 lockdown in October. On Friday the commission\u2019s inspector, Bruce McClintock SC, tabled a report in the NSW parliament which revealed that he had decided to conduct an investigation into the decision to launch the inquiry after receiving \u201cseveral complaints\u201d about the decision. \u201cThe Icac itself has informed me that it too received complaints from members of the public in relation to this matter,\u201d he wrote in the report. But having reviewed the watchdog\u2019s conduct, McClintock found it had acted \u201clawfully and in conformity\u201d with the act, and was not unreasonable. He also dismissed complaints about the timing of the investigation, saying Icac could have been accused of \u201cpartiality\u201d towards Berejiklian if it did not launch the probe.\n\u201cHaving concluded that there was sufficient basis to investigate the matters in question further and hold a public inquiry, I believe the commission was correct to proceed as it did,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHad it failed to do so, it could itself have been justifiably accused of failing to perform its statutory functions and, indeed, of partiality to the premier.\u201d During his first press conference as premier, Perrottet said changes to the watchdog\u2019s power were not a priority for him, and on Tuesday he said he would not comment on the body\u2019s powers until after its report was complete. \u201cThe independent commission needs to have, free from political interference, the opportunity to conclude its work and to provide a public report and when they provide a public report, we\u2019ll consider that report and if there\u2019s any action \u2026 we need to take, we will,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/nsw-premier-rules-out-changing-mp-private-phones-rules-until-icac-releases-gladys-berejiklian-report", "last_update": "2021-11-02T06:21:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen, Samoa It was the day before we were supposed to fly to Australia for a family reunion and Christmas in 2012, so it was a very exciting day to start off with. There was a cyclone due to hit Samoa. It started to rain really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water rising just around the house. At around 4.30, I heard my husband screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong. By the time I made it outside, there was a massive gush of water coming towards our house, like an inland tsunami. My husband yelled to grab the kids. My baby was sitting on the toilet. I grabbed him by the arm. The water was rising so quickly that by the time we made it out of the house, the water was up to our hips. We were already struggling.\nWe have four children and so my husband and I had one child on each arm as we waded through the water. There was one point where my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I thought: please, please, Heavenly Father, don\u2019t let us have to make a decision to let one of our children go. We all made it through, thank goodness. But the thought of having to let go of one of our children, I wouldn\u2019t wish it upon any parent. We made it into the workshop, and climbed the stairs towards the little storeroom. Our entire house was gone, our cars had been washed away, big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the ground had washed away \u2013 that\u2019s how strong the water was. We stayed up in the storeroom for several hours, wrapped in old, dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm. I remember thinking: if we make it out alive, how and where are we going to start all over again? We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost everything in that flash flood, we decided to move to Australia. Australia has been kind to us, but as much as we say this is home, Samoa will always be home. I miss Samoa.

{"title": "The Young HG Wells review \u2013 the shape of things to come", "article": "It was a transformation as outlandish as anything in his fiction. In late Victorian Kent, Herbert George Wells was a shopkeeper\u2019s sickly son threatening to kill himself if he couldn\u2019t study science rather than fester in a hated apprenticeship. By the 1900s, not yet 40 and already with a string of future sci-fi classics to his name (The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The Island of Doctor Moreau), he was en route to global stardom, hobnobbing at the White House and settling into life as a Jaeger-suited serial shagger who, 5ft 8in on his tiptoes, bedded a roll call of contemporary literary talent, from Dorothy Richardson to Rebecca West, all while playing a growing field of publishers and agents eager for a storytelling gift powerful enough to sow panic that Earth was under alien attack, at least among listeners to Orson Welles\u2019s 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds. As Claire Tomalin\u2019s sprightly new biography points out, Wells only turned to writing because dodgy lungs forced him to give up teaching, yet cork-lined isolation was never to be his lot. When sex with his first wife, Isabel, proved disappointing, he got divorced, having already set up with a student, Amy, whom, astoundingly, he renamed Jane. Once she was pregnant with their first child, he argued (apparently successfully) that he should be free to sleep around while she kept house, because she was \u201cfragile\u201d and he required a \u201ccomplete loveliness of bodily response\u201d.\nNor was Wells for monogamy in prose. Initially seen as an English Jules Verne on account of his futuristic early fiction, he soon switched to comic social realism fed by a class-climber\u2019s eye for detail (Kipps, Tono-Bungay), all the while churning out journalism, reviews, historical and scientific textbooks and political tracts. His influence on George Orwell wasn\u2019t only down to his fiction \u2013 a germ of Nineteen Eighty-Four lies in Wells\u2019s When the Sleeper Wakes, about a man who rises from a 200-year slumber to find London under fascist rule and ravaged by air war \u2013 but also in his persona as a public intellectual ready to hold forth, whatever the issue of the day. Having cut his teeth during a late Victorian print boom fuelled by the growth of the reading public, he was well placed to take advantage of the era; he even got to know his second wife while commuting on the newly opened District line. A certain shamelessness aided Wells\u2019s rise: who else would have thought to ask the prime minister for a stipend? (Balfour said no, in part because Wells was already earning more than a grand a year, a healthy six-figure sum today.) Most of all, there was Wells\u2019s hunger for work: bashing out 7,000 words a day, he never shook the jobbing writer\u2019s fear of going under, a prospect made stark when a loyal confr\u00e8re died of pneumonia at 30. Tomalin wonders aloud how Wells managed, while laying out abundant evidence of how the sausage was made. Witness her paragraph on the death of his mother in June 1905: \u201cShe had fallen down the stairs at Easter\u2026 Wells went over and found a nurse to help out, but he was too busy to stay and was not there when she died. He arrived soon afterwards and cleared up her affairs. Then back to work. In October 1905, Kipps was published and sold 12,000 copies before Christmas \u2013 good news for Wells\u2019s finances.\u201d Tomalin leans heavily on Wells\u2019s 1934 memoir An Experiment in Autobiography, which sometimes lends a dutiful air to proceedings, particularly during the scene-setting of the early years. A bigger problem is the way paraphrase can slip into endorsement. Comparing Wells with his contemporary George Gissing, Tomalin says that Gissing let himself \u201cbe humiliated and defeated \u2013 by women and by life \u2013 while Wells knew how to work for success, how to enjoy women and the world and how to fight and \u2013 usually \u2013 to win\u201d. Yet such terms of approval sit ill with Wells\u2019s conduct as portrayed here, not least because one of Tomalin\u2019s coups is to quote from his unpublished letters to Amber Reeves, a midlife lover who was a Cambridge student half his age: \u201cDidn\u2019t I have Isabel because I wanted her and chucked her because I wanted to and have Jane? I never gave up anything I wanted (and I ain\u2019t going to do so now).\u201d When Reeves was pregnant, Wells\u2019s wife bought the baby clothes; when Wells\u2019s stay with Reeves at a French villa didn\u2019t work out \u2013 apparently she was no good at keeping house \u2013 he made good on his outlay by bringing Jane and his sons there instead. Tomalin\u2019s decision to restrict herself to the \u201cyoung\u201d Wells never strikes the reader as anything but pragmatic, despite her explanation that she found herself particularly drawn to the phase of his best-remembered fiction. In any case, Tomalin keeps pace with her subject into midlife, in part, she says, because he continued to behave like a young man, which is rather a polite way to call him immature. Perhaps the psychic dislocation of rapid celebrity meant he never felt quite secure. The notion, given voice in 1909\u2019s Tono-Bungay, that \u201cevery human being had a \u2018place\u2019. It belonged to you from your birth like the colour of your eyes\u201d, was one his personal striving \u2013 the philandering and politicking as well as the fiction \u2013 always sought to undo. During one of the bouts of sickness that pockmarked his youth, he feared he might die a virgin without becoming famous; achievement unlocked, to say the least, but at what cost? Tomalin\u2019s generous reserve lets her reader decide. \u2022 The Young HG Wells: Changing the World by Claire Tomalin is published by Viking (\u00a320).

{"title": "Pixel 6 review: the cut-price Google flagship phone", "article": "The Pixel 6 is Google\u2019s affordable flagship phone for 2021 and proves to be a leader in the field with a top-class camera and a new advanced chip at its heart \u2013 while undercutting most of the competition on price. The phone costs \u00a3599 ($599/A$999), which is \u00a3250 less than the Pixel 6 Pro, while still offering 90% of what you get with Google\u2019s top model. It has a 6.4in 90Hz OLED screen that is flat, not curved at the sides. The display is slightly less sharp, slower and smaller than that on the 6 Pro, but is still very good with excellent brightness and viewing angles.\nThe sides are painted black aluminium, the back is glass, and there is a large camera bar design similar to the 6 Pro. Despite the reduced screen size the Pixel 6 is not a small phone and is only 1.1mm narrower and 3g lighter than its bigger sibling. Those with smaller hands will struggle to hold it in one hand without an attachment. Specifications Screen: 6.4in 90Hz FHD+ OLED (411ppi) Processor: Google Tensor RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: Android 12 Camera: 50MP + 12MP ultrawide, 8MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 158.6 x 74.8 x 8.9mm Weight: 207g Tensor chip\nAlong with the Pixel 6 Pro, the Pixel 6 is the first phone to feature Google\u2019s custom Tensor processor. It matches rivals from Qualcomm and Samsung on speed, but is better optimised for Google\u2019s various AI systems. Battery life is good but not great, lasting about 34 hours between charges, putting on par with rivals from Samsung and but some way behind 46-hour iPhone 13. That was with the screen on for about five hours in various messaging, note-taking and utility apps, the browser and taking about 20 photos, spending about two hours on 5G and the rest on wifi. Sustainability\nGoogle does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity after 500 full charge cycles. The Pixel 6 is generally repairable by Google and third-party repair shops. Screen repairs cost \u00a3129, back glass repairs cost \u00a3139 and battery replacements cost \u00a389 out of warranty. The Pixel 6 contains 100% recycled aluminium in its frame, accounting for about 14% of the phone by weight. The company publishes environmental impact reports for some of its products. Google will recycle all Pixel devices free of charge. Android 12\nThe Pixel 6 ships with Google\u2019s latest Android 12, which includes a load of customisation options and refinements. For more, see the Pixel 6 Pro review. Google will provide at least three years of major Android updates and monthly security fixes. It will then provide an additional two years of updates with the \u201cfrequency and categories of updates depending on the hardware capabilities and needs\u201d. Samsung supports its top phones for four years, while Fairphone is aiming for six years and Apple supports its iPhone for up to seven years. Camera\nThe Pixel 6 has the same 50-megapixel main and 12MP ultrawide camera as the 6 Pro and produces very similar results. That makes it one of the very best cameras you can get on a smartphone, particularly at under \u00a3600. It lacks an optical zoom camera, and while Google\u2019s up to 7x digital zoom is one of the best, it is no substitute for optical magnification. The 8MP selfie camera is good, producing detailed shots with lots of drama, but occasionally the images were a bit soft, particularly in lower light levels. Observations\nCall quality and 5G reception was good, as was Bluetooth performance to several sets of headphones. The bottom corners were noticeably hard, digging in more than other devices in my palm when holding it one-handed. The volume and power buttons work well but are a little loose, allowing them to rattle a bit. Price The Google Pixel 6 costs \u00a3599 ($599/A$999) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the Pixel 6 Pro costs \u00a3849, Pixel 4a costs \u00a3349, the OnePlus 9 costs \u00a3629, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ costs \u00a3949, the Xiaomi 11T Pro costs \u00a3599, the iPhone 13 costs \u00a3779 and the Fairphone 4 costs \u00a3499. Verdict Where the Pixel 6 Pro is about competing on an equal footing with the top smartphones on the market, the Pixel 6 offers all of what makes Google phones great while significantly undercutting the competition on price. You get snappy performance, decent battery life, Google\u2019s top new chip and a slick experience packed with all the software bells and whistles you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Google\u2019s local AI-powered voice and keyboard typing is quite something, and you will get at least five years of security updates from release. Plus the phone has the main and ultrawide lenses of Google\u2019s next-generation class-leading camera system. The lack of an optical zoom and slightly picky fingerprint scanner can be forgiven for the price. Costing just \u00a3599, the Pixel 6 is priced more in line with Chinese challenger brands than the top Samsung and Apple devices with which it competes favourably. That makes the Pixel 6 is a real bargain for a top-flight phone. You have to spend considerably more to get a better Android phone than this. Pros: class-leading camera, great screen, excellent performance, good battery life, recycled aluminium, five years of security updates, Android 12, impressive local AI features, very competitively priced. Cons: fairly slow charging, no optical zoom, fingerprint scanner can be picky, no face unlock option, only three years of Android version updates despite five years of security support.\nOther reviews Pixel 6 Pro review: the very best Google phone Pixel 4a review: the best phone Google has made in years OnePlus 9 review: a good, well-priced top-spec smartphone Galaxy S21+ review: the big-screen Samsung phone for slightly less Apple iPhone 13 review: cheaper, longer lasting and better camera Fairphone 4 review: ethical repairable phone gets big upgrade \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2021.

{"title": "Priti Patel urged to justify claim that most boat migrants are not real refugees", "article": "There are calls for Priti Patel to withdraw or justify claims she made before parliament that most people who travel to the UK in small boats are not genuine asylum seekers. Two Labour peers, David Blunkett and Shami Chakrabarti, have also questioned whether the home secretary has evidence that backs her claim that \u201c70% of individuals on small boats are single men who are effectively economic migrants\u201d. There is deepening concern from refugee charities that the government is feeding an untrue narrative that claims migrants who travel to the UK by boat are undeserving of sympathy. At the Lords home affairs and justice committee last week, Patel was questioned about her new policy of deeming any person who arrives in the UK to claim asylum after passing through a \u201csafe\u201d country as \u201cinadmissible\u201d \u2013 meaning their claim will not be considered. Describing the people who would fall into this category, she said: \u201cIn the last year, 70% of individuals on small boats are single men who are effectively economic migrants. They are not genuine asylum seekers.\u201d Home Office officials were asked to provide data that backed up the home secretary\u2019s assertions. A source from the department said that of 8,500 people arriving by small boat in 2020 87% were men and 74% were aged between 18 and 39 \u2013 but did not provide evidence related to their asylum claims. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cFrance is a safe country; people should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach rather than making dangerous and illegal crossings.\u201d Lady Chakrabarti, the former head of Liberty and a member of the committee, said Patel\u2019s comments should be properly explained, corrected or withdrawn. \u201cBoth the refugee convention and the lives of desperate people are too precious for the home secretary\u2019s 70% statement to go unchallenged,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the Home Office really saying that most single male asylum seekers or most people crossing the Channel are \u2018economic migrants\u2019 and unworthy of refuge? If yes, what happened to giving anxious scrutiny to every individual claim for asylum?\u201d Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary who asked Patel the question that provoked the \u201c70%\u201d response, said the government could struggle to justify the figure because officials were still processing a backlog of asylum claims. \u201cIt is not surprising that the Home Office has not responded [to the Guardian\u2019s request to justify the 70% claim] given that the backlog of cases is so extreme. The latest figure I saw was 125,000, which exceeds many previous years. \u201cThere is a presumption being made by the home secretary about their claims before they have had an opportunity to make their claims. Until the backlog is massively reduced we won\u2019t know about those arrivals who come over the summer,\u201d he said.\nIn oral evidence to the home affairs select committee in September 2020, Abi Tierney, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration, stated that of 5,000 people who had crossed in 2020 until the date of the committee meeting, 98% had claimed asylum. Published Home Office data shows that many of those arriving on small boats whose claims were deemed inadmissible originate from conflict zones such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. Dr Peter Walsh, a researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cA majority of asylum claims (including those of people who arrived in the UK by small boat) are ultimately successful. Specifically, the Home Office reports that 59% of claims filed in 2017 to 2019 inclusive were ultimately successful, accounting for appeals. \u201cIt is reasonable to suppose that Channel migrants will be more likely than other asylum seekers to have their asylum claims granted. This is because the nationalities that are most common among Channel migrants \u2013 like Iranian, Syrian, Afghan and Yemeni \u2013 have a higher-than-average likelihood of ultimately being successful. It is not clear what evidence exists to support the claim that 70% of Channel migrants are economic migrants. But on the basis of the available data, it seems unlikely that no more than 30% of Channel migrants would have their asylum claims accepted.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/02/priti-patel-urged-to-justify-claim-most-boat-migrants-not-real-refugees", "last_update": "2021-11-02T17:30:10Z", "source": "Guardian"},

MB, Falmouth You need to reassure him that there is nothing QDR can do to him because he is not the owner of the vehicle or named on the letters. In the unlikely event that they secured a county court judgment, and a bailiff turned up, they would have to leave as soon as he, or you, explained that the person on the document has never lived there. I asked QDR to check the electoral roll and respond to your letter, but it sent a stock email. It is not helped by the fact that your neighbour is not the person they are trying to find. You could write to the DVLA; however, your letter will join the backlog probably building up at its Swansea HQ. If you had a response in six months I would be amazed.

People get them for children, but it\u2019s a terrible fit, because there is nothing rabbits find more annoying than children.

{"title": "We need radical policies to reach net zero. Here's a fairer way to do them | Polly Toynbee", "article": "Are we doomed, or is there still a chance to save civilisation? It\u2019s easy to veer between despair and slender hope, when the UN says emissions that need to fall by half this decade are only on course for a cut of about 7.5%. How helpless we feel when big emitters refuse to attend Cop26. What an unconvincing \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d call to action from Boris Johnson, who is cutting foreign aid and the cost of domestic flights while mulling a new coalmine and a Shetland oilfield. The absurd Brexit fishing spat makes a mockery of exhorting other world leaders to lift their sights to the horizons of the climate crisis. The scale of what\u2019s needed is politically unfathomable. Yet Johnson pretends answers can be conjured up \u201cwithout so much as a hair shirt in sight\u201d. In thundering, prophetic form, a recent article from George Monbiot set him right: the world\u2019s richest 1% emit 35 times what each individual should use to ensure global heating does not exceed a 1.5C rise. The super-rich use their fortunes to shape the political agenda, diverting our attention from the true climate culprits with the \u201cmicro consumerist bollocks\u201d of ditching coffee cups and plastic bags. \u201cWe will endure only if we cease to consent,\u201d Monbiot writes \u2013 and he\u2019s right. But as ever the political problem is how to get the world\u2019s people to rebel. In Britain, voters increasingly care about the climate; it has risen to a close fourth place behind the leading concerns of Brexit, Covid and the economy. Concern is strongest in London and the south of England (33% compared with 24% nationally), social grade AB (34%), and the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups (31% and 35% respectively). When cowardly politicians fail to lead, the question is how to use every imaginable instrument to engage everyone all the time. Greta Thunberg is a remarkably wise campaigner, who understands the politics of persuasion. Yes, it\u2019s necessary that some people get annoyed with school strikes and road blocks, she told Andrew Marr on Sunday, but with this important message: \u201cThere is no final tipping point where everything is lost. If we miss 1.5C then we go for 1.6C then 1.7C. It is never too late to do as much as we can.\u201d That\u2019s a vital thought to ward off despairing nihilism. Here\u2019s one action that will be necessary: carbon taxes. Writing in the Financial Times, the economist Tim Harford recently suggested that every product needs a carbon price attached, sending a signal not just to the buyer, but right down every supply chain to use less energy in growing, manufacturing and transporting a product to attract less tax. That will be necessary. But any climate-abating tax brings on green crocodile tears for poor people, often from the same Tory MPs who just voted to remove the \u00a320 universal credit uplift. The claim that carbon taxes would disproportionately affect the poorest people was what killed off the fuel price escalator \u2013 a yearly tax increase devised by the Tories in 1993 to discourage driving \u2013 after owner-driver hauliers blockaded oil refineries in 2000. When the climate demands that fuel taxes rise, politicians make them fall. There are subtler ways to impose carbon taxes. In 2006, the former Labour environment secretary David Miliband put forward a radical scheme for tradable personal carbon allowances (PCAs). Everyone would have a carbon allowance to spend on heating, petrol or flying, issued by a central carbon bank. The national allowance would shrink each year to cut personal carbon emissions. The well-off use the most carbon \u2013 they have big houses, drive SUVs and fly frequently \u2013 while half the population never flies, and many live in flats or small homes. Some 17m households have no car. Carbon credits would be tradable, so those using least could profit by selling some of their allowance, while heavy users would have to buy their spare credits via the carbon bank. This policy could be a potential win-win-win: it would fix an annual reduction in carbon emissions and redistribute cash from the extravagant to the carbon thrifty in this most unequal country. Above all it would engage everyone to think hard about their carbon consumption, giving them an incentive to save or profit. Miliband\u2019s speech advocating the scheme labelled it \u201ca thought experiment\u201d, as it was way out ahead of timid government policy. But four official feasibility studies were commissioned. Some suggested the measure was too technically difficult, but that was before the first iPhone, let alone the supermarket smart cards that count each purchase. Some warned of the bravery this untried system would require. Others said it was a clunky, bureaucratic way to impose carbon taxes \u2013 but that misses the key point of engaging every citizen: VAT is invisible to most shoppers. Prof Paul Ekins of University College London\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Resources co-authored an official Defra report in 2008 which found the idea feasible and relatively fair, but decided it was too radical for the government, who dismissed it as \u201can interesting concept ... ahead of its time\u201d. Ekins and other researchers now think its time has come. By the time feasibility reports emerged, Miliband had moved to the Foreign Office, but he remains convinced PCAs could make a key contribution, though like any single action, \u201cthis is no silver bullet,\u201d he told me: the heaviest lifting must be done by governments and industry more than individual consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s a nudge \u2013 but with teeth and carrots.\u201d Of all the colossal transformations needed, the hardest will be changing public attitudes. PCAs could kickstart public demand for the big capital collective programmes that would be necessary to conserve allowances, such as district heating schemes, rather than every flat or terraced house buying an expensive heat pump. \u201cPeople are desperate to do something, but too often they get trivial advice, such as pre-rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. A personal carbon allowance system would tell them what they could do to make a real difference,\u201d Prof Ekins says. At the heart of behaviour change is an \u201cI will if you will\u201d certainty that demands tough government action. By adding in the true price to the planet, PCAs challenge the notion that economic growth in a developed country is the only goal. Do I think this government of the rich for the rich would do it? No chance. But I think it could be popular. There would be more winners than losers. And PCAs would be a fairer way to lower emissions in a transition that will inevitably require hair shirts for some \u2013 despite Johnson\u2019s magical thinking.

{"title": "BBC earns \u00a3300,000 from Saudi oil firm despite net-zero pledge", "article": "The BBC received about \u00a3300,000 in advertising revenue last year from Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, Aramco, despite BBC director general Tim Davie calling on every arm of the broadcaster to \u201cdial up the focus on sustainability\u201d and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. Although the BBC does not carry advertising in the UK, much of its overseas output is supported by commercials.\nBig fossil fuel companies have spent approximately $660,000 (\u00a3483,000) with the BBC on US-focused digital adverts since 2018, according to projections produced by the advertising data firm MediaRadar. Most of this came from the national Saudi oil company \u2013 although BP, Exelon and Phillips 66 are among the other fossil fuel business estimated to have spent five-figure sums advertising on the BBC\u2019s digital outlets. The real figure for how much the BBC is making from large fossil fuel companies could be much higher when other forms of advertising are taken into account. Last month the BBC said it would be trying to eliminate \u201cfossil fuel usage across its operations\u201d as part of a \u201cdeep decarbonisation\u201d strategy to hit net zero by 2030, but the corporation has been accepting money from companies that take oil and gas out of the ground. \u201cWe have clear guidelines around advertising which are publicly available,\u201d said a BBC spokesperson. \u201cWe take care with all of our advertising to ensure it is not misleading.\u201d Davie has emphasised the need to increase the corporation\u2019s commercial revenues, including from outside the UK, to make up for the real-terms cuts to the licence fee income imposed by the British government. Despite continuing to accept money from big fossil fuel companies, the BBC is among the online publishers who have also benefited from the increase in advertising around environment-related material in recent weeks, as corporations rush to promote their green credentials before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. The BBC has struck deals with the international investment arm of the Scottish government to make a series of programmes on how to reduce carbon in the buildup to Cop26. There is also BBC material sponsored by US supermarket giant Walmart \u201clooking at nine countries\u2019 progress on climate since signing the Paris Agreement\u201d, as well as episodes of a show called Follow the Food: The Carbon Challenge about food security, sponsored by Corteva Agriscience.\nThe Guardian stopped accepting advertising from oil and gas companies two years ago, although most other leading news outlets continue to take substantial sums. Using the same estimates from MediaRadar for US-focused digital advertising bought by big fossil fuel companies, the Washington Post has taken $12.8m since 2016, Politico took $9.5m, CNN took $6.6m, and the New York Times took $4.5m. The Washington Post, Politico and CNN did not respond to a request for comment. The New York Times repeated its commitment to journalism covering the climate crisis, but does not have a policy against accepting ad money beyond their general guidelines: \u201cAll advertising is clearly labeled, entirely separate from our newsroom and plays an important role in helping to fund our independent journalism and the continued expansion of our coverage on the biggest stories of our time, including climate change, across a breadth of analysis and formats.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/bbc-earns-300000-from-saudi-oil-firm-despite-net-zero-pledge", "last_update": "2021-11-01T23:24:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Toyota announces the bZ4X: the carmaker\u2019s first mass-produced electric vehicle ", "article": "Toyota has released details about its first mass-produced electric vehicle in a significant step for the world\u2019s second-biggest carmaker. The bZ4X is an SUV with optional rooftop solar panels that will be sold in both front-wheel or all-wheel-drive variants. The public had its first look at the concept for the bZ4X \u2013 \u201cbZ\u201d stands for \u201cbeyond zero\u201d \u2013 at the Shanghai motor show in April this year, but Toyota only published the details of the car on Friday. The announcement is a step forward for Toyota, which has been slower to move into purely battery-powered electric vehicles than its competitors, relying heavily on hybrid technology instead.\nWhile the car isn\u2019t Toyota\u2019s first electrified vehicle \u2013 that title was held by the short-lived RAV4 EV \u2013 it marks the first electric vehicle that will directly compete with industry rivals such as the Hyundai Ioniq and the Tesla Model Y. Toyota already produces the second-generation Mirai, an electrified vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The bZ4X will be launched in Europe on 2 December, with orders to be placed by reservation. It is expected the model will enter series production from the middle of next year across \u201call regions worldwide\u201d \u2013 though the precise timing, price and variants available has yet to be released. Toyota expects this will form an extended range of 70 electrified vehicles by 2025. Subaru helped developed the vehicle and is expected to reveal its own EV model next year. It is anticipated the bZX4 will arrive in Australia by late 2022. As Australia\u2019s most popular car brand, it is expected the model will help Toyota take a dominant position in the country\u2019s growing electric vehicle market, as its competitors have been put off by a lack of clear political leadership in making the transition. Hybrid vehicles accounted for nearly a third of Toyota\u2019s total sales in Australia this year. The bZ4x will be the first of 15 planned zero-emissions vehicles offered by Toyota, including seven bZ models.\nThe front-wheel drive version comes with a 150kw motor with 265 Nm of torque that is capable of zero to 100km/h in 8.4 seconds. The all-wheel-drive model comes equipped with two 80kW motors that produce a combined 160kW and 336Nm of torque, capable of zero to 100km/h in 7.7 seconds. Both variants will have a top speed of 160km/h, and will come with a 71.4kWh battery offering a range of roughly 500km. Toyota says the 150kW DC charger will allow the batteries to be recharged to 80% in 30 minutes. Solar panels can be built into the roof for use while driving or when parked. Toyota says these panels will add an extra 1800km of driving distance each year, while allowing the car to be charged when parked or where there are no charging stations easily available.\nAt 4.69m long, 1.65m high and 1.86m wide the bZ4X will be similar in size to the Hyundai Ioniq. While the company has not released complete details of the interior, among the more unique aspects is the steer-by-wire system which works without any direct mechanical link between the steering wheel and the tyres. The technology is similar to the fly-by-wire system used by modern jet aircraft and means the driver will only receive feedback from the road, as they will not feel vibrations from the tyres via the steering wheel. This aircraft feel is extended with the option for a \u201cyoke\u201d steering wheel similar to the Tesla Model S. Toyota says its version will deliver better performance with 150 degrees of lock so the driver will not have to change hand positions when turning.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/toyota-announces-the-bz4x-the-carmakers-first-mass-produced-electric-vehicle", "last_update": "2021-11-02T06:32:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Australia may soon follow America in vaccinating children as young as five |  Alexandra Martiniuk and Elizabeth Elliott", "article": "Australia\u2019s 2.3 million children aged five to 11 years may be able to receive the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 before the end of 2021 if Australia follows the lead of the United States. On 29 October, the Federal Drug Administration approved Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine for emergency use in American children aged five to 11 years. If it is recommended by the US Centres for Disease Control, which meets this week, the vaccine will be available immediately for 28 million eligible children aged five to 11 years in the US. Pfizer\u2019s application for use in Australia Pfizer supplied initial data on the vaccine for five to 11-year-olds to Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on 26 October. During the health minister\u2019s press conference the next day, the head of the TGA, Professor John Skerritt, said \u201cit will take a few weeks [for approval of the vaccine for 5-11-year-olds] but I would hope that we get there by the end of November\u201d. Here\u2019s the crux of the issue about Covid-19 vaccinations for younger children. Australian and international data demonstrate children in this five to 11 age group typically get mild disease; unwell with fever, vomiting, and cough, but worrying parents. However, some do get very sick, need hospitalisation, ICU, get long Covid and rarely, can die. The US has had 558 Covid-19-associated child deaths (0-17 years) and 94 were aged five to 11, Canada has had 17 deaths in children (under 18 years), and Australia has had two deaths in children (in their teens). Yet, according to the Indonesian Paediatric Society, Covid-19 has caused death in more than 1,245 Indonesian children, half of whom were under one year of age. Australia however has had far fewer cases of Covid-19 than most countries globally. Although severe outcomes from Covid-19 are more typical in children with underlying conditions, that is not always the case, and up to 30% of children who become severely ill have no known risk factors. So, we have vaccines. Pfizer\u2019s is the first trial of a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine for this age group. There were no serious adverse events due to vaccination reported in the trial but we know that mRNA vaccines have, very rarely, caused myocarditis and/or pericarditis in teens and young adults at a rate of one or two per 100,000. The risk of developing myocarditis/pericarditis from the vaccine is much less than with Covid-19 itself: the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) notes the benefits of vaccination outweigh risks in all age groups. Many countries have already started vaccinating younger children against Covid-19. For instance, Slovakia launched Pfizer vaccination for vulnerable five to 11-year-olds on 9 September. Cuba has been vaccinating children aged two to 10 with Cuban-developed vaccines. China has been vaccinating vulnerable three- to 17-year-olds since June using Sinovac, and will soon mandate vaccines to attend school. Chile and Cambodia have also been vaccinating six- to 12-year-olds with Sinovac since September. The United Arab Emirates has been giving Sinopharm to three to 17-year-olds since August and India approved their Bharat Biotech\u2019s Covaxin Covid-19 vaccine for two to 18-year-olds two weeks ago. The impact of Covid-19 on young children In the current surge of cases in the UK, school-age children are about 15 times as likely to be infected as 80-year-olds and are believed to be driving the high UK case numbers. Similarly, and consistent with international data, children under 10 are the fastest growing age group contracting Covid-19 in Australia. To date in Australia, 21,616 children aged under nine years and 46,297 children under 19 years have tested positive for Covid-19; with about 2.5% to 3% of these children requiring hospitalisation. This is similar to the US, where about 2% of children with Covid-19 required hospitalisation, out of the 6.3 million American children aged under 18 who tested positive. There have been 5,217 cases of the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome following Covid-19 infection in children in the US. Children with Covid-19 can transmit the infection. It is particularly difficult for household members to keep social distance from a sick young child. In New South Wales alone, 67 schools have been closed so far during term four because of a Covid case in a student and/or staff. Kids (and teachers) must take time off school if infected with Covid-19 or are a close contact of a positive case. Parents must take time off work to care for their sick and/or isolating children. Few good quality data are available on long Covid in children, so we don\u2019t yet know the real risk. Estimates of prevalence of long Covid in children and adolescents range from 0% to 27% with the true prevalence likely about 4%. Affected children report ongoing symptoms such as extreme fatigue, disturbance of taste and smell, headaches, and \u201cbrain fog\u2019\u201d. Anticipated uptake of the vaccine for younger children Currently there are no alternatives to the Pfizer vaccine for young children though Moderna\u2019s is currently under trial. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not being trialled in this age group. Atagi may initially recommend the vaccine only for children aged five to 11 years with specific risk factors, children living in a household with a vulnerable family member, or children living in a Covid-19 \u201chotspot\u201d. This approach was used in the initial rollout of the vaccine to teenagers in both the UK and Australia, with vaccine access later opened to all. Vaccination remains a key tool against Covid-19. In the US one third of parents with children five to 11 plan to vaccinate as soon as possible and Australia has an enviable record in vaccination uptake (44% of teens (12-16 years) are already fully vaccinated), so this bodes well for our future with Covid-19. We just need to ensure that vulnerable groups are not left behind and that we assist in vaccinating countries in our region. \u2022 Professor Alexandra Martiniuk is an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney.

{"title": "Tuesday briefing: World leaders strike deal to halt deforestation", "article": "Top story: \u2018Zero chance if we lose the great forests\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here to embiggen your knowledge of current affairs. World leaders have agreed a deal that aims to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade as part of a multibillion-dollar package to tackle human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. By signing the Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forest and Land Use, presidents and prime ministers from major producers and consumers of deforestation-linked products will commit to protect forest ecosystems. Boris Johnson will unveil the agreement at the Cop26 summit in the presence of the US president, Joe Biden, the Prince of Wales and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo. Writing in the Guardian today, the UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith hails the forests deal as \u201cunprecedented \u2026 Globally, nature-based solutions such as forests, mangroves and peatlands could provide about a third of the most effective and cost-effective solutions to the climate crisis that we need now \u2013 but currently, they attract just 3% of total global climate finance. If we were to lose any of the world\u2019s great forests, we would have zero chance of stabilising the world\u2019s climate.\u201d The commitment comes as more than 120 world leaders meet in Glasgow to thrash out fresh commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that key countries have failed to step up. In developments so far, India has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070 \u2013 seen by experts as a realistic commitment, but 20 years behind the 2050 date agreed by other countries; while the the Queen called on leaders to \u201crise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship\u201d, for the sake of future generations. * * * Fishing talks \u2018need to continue\u2019 \u2013 Emmanuel Macron has shelved his threat to clog up UK exports and ban its fishers from landing catches at French ports from this morning in a dispute over access to British fishing waters. A proposal was put forward by Macron\u2019s government late on Monday and discussions resumed. \u201cThe talks need to continue,\u201d Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. David Frost, the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, is to meet Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, the French minister for EU affairs, in Paris on Thursday to discuss possible ways out of the crisis. * * * \u2018Devastating\u2019 \u2013 Thousands of babies in England are being born prematurely, smaller than expected or stillborn because of \u201calarming\u201d and \u201cdevastating\u201d socioeconomic and racial inequalities, a study has suggested. Research involving more than 1m births suggests socioeconomic inequalities account for a quarter of all stillbirths, a fifth of preterm births, and a third of cases of foetal growth restriction (FGR) in which babies are smaller than expected for their gestational age. One in 10 stillbirths and almost one in five FGR cases are due to racial inequalities, the study suggests. Prof Jan van der Meulen of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, a co-lead author of the study, said: \u201cNational targets to make pregnancy safer will only be achieved if there is a concerted effort by midwives, obstetricians, public health professionals and politicians to tackle the broader socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities.\u201d * * * Less than smart \u2013 The construction of smart motorways should be paused until promised safety improvements have been delivered and there is more evidence to assess the risks, MPs have urged. The transport select committee criticised as premature the decision by Grant Shapps in March 2020 to press ahead with the controversial motorways, which manage road speeds through electronic signs and do not have a hard shoulder. The report said available evidence regarding safety was \u201climited and volatile\u201d, and urged greater powers for the Office of Rail and Road to block new road schemes until it was satisfied of their safety. They are calling for more emergency refuge areas never more than one mile apart, and every 0.75 miles where possible. The highway code should also be updated with instructions to drivers to create corridors to allow emergency services through. * * * Bosnian peace under threat \u2013 Christian Schmidt, the UN-backed high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, has warned that the country is in imminent danger of breaking apart. The Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has threatened to force the Bosnian part of the armed forces to withdraw from the Republika Srpska \u2013 the Serb half of Bosnia \u2013 by surrounding its barracks with Serb troops. If the Serb separatists carried out their threat, more international peacekeepers would have to be sent in, Schmidt said in a report seen by the Guardian. Russia has threatened to block this week\u2019s annual renewal of the peacekeepers\u2019 mandate unless the text cuts out any reference to the UN high representative, who oversees the 1995 Dayton deal that keeps the peace in Bosnia. * * * Meta versus Meta \u2013 Meta PCs, an Arizona-based computer retail company, has found itself in a potential intellectual property war with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg decided to use the name Meta for his social media conglomerate. Meta PCs is reported by TMZ to have filed for its trademark in August. Founders Zack Shutt and Joe Darger have told TMZ they won\u2019t sell the name for less than $20m if Zuckerberg tries to get it. Facebook did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comments, but someone affiliated with the company told TMZ they were not too worried and had the required rights to acquire the name.

{"title": "Am\u00e9lie at 20: how has the sugar-sweet Parisian whimsy aged?", "article": "There\u2019s a defining moment early in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s Am\u00e9lie when Am\u00e9lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), a painfully shy and uncommonly adorable waitress at the Two Windmills cafe in Montmartre, arranges the return of childhood treasures to a middle-aged man who\u2019d hidden them in her apartment building 40 years earlier. She has gone through an exhaustive search to find this man, meeting all manner of eccentric Parisians along the way, but she eventually summons the right person to a phone booth and watches the tears roll down his cheeks as this tin full of trinkets unleashes a flood of memories.\nAs she glides blissfully through the frame, the narrator says, \u201cAm\u00e9lie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony. It\u2019s a perfect moment. A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.\u201d Am\u00e9lie is not really a film about love, as much as its heroine does to manufacture it for others \u2014 and finally, winsomely, for herself. And Am\u00e9lie is not really a film about altruism, either, given how much time she spends tormenting the nasty greengrocer (Urbain Cancelier) who abuses his sweet, simple-minded assistant (Jamel Debbouze). It\u2019s really a film about perfection, a fantasy about how a messy world can, through force of will and timing and deftness of touch, be harmonized down to the second. There\u2019s a mechanical quality to the film that\u2019s completely at odds with the spontaneity and surprise of authentic passion. That \u201cstrange feeling of absolute harmony\u201d is the metronomic ticking that Jeunet manufactures here \u2013 satisfying perhaps, but in no way romantic. Yet 20 years later, Am\u00e9lie does feel like an important shift in film-making style, a natural bookend to Moulin Rouge earlier in the year. The medium was entering an era of extreme plasticity, where the world could be bended and refined down to the pixel, and engineered to achieve moments of pristine, storyboarded flawlessness. There\u2019s quite literally not a hair out of place in Am\u00e9lie \u2013 Audrey Tautou\u2019s immaculate bob is the greatest achievement in French hairdressing since Anna Karina\u2019s bangs in Vivre Sa Vie \u2013 but the cold order of the film should not be mistaken for swooning romanticism.\nAm\u00e9lie also recalls a classic Onion headline that predates it by two years: Romantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested. Among the details in the restraining order against this man is that he\u2019d stalked a woman for two months, spied on her and tapped her phone, and \u201ctricked her into boarding Caribbean-bound jets\u201d. Am\u00e9lie may have a more delicate touch and a timidness that relegates her to the sidelines of her own life, but the film celebrates a quirkiness that\u2019s millimeters away from derangement, as she makes elaborate interventions on people\u2019s lives and teases the man she desires with Rube Goldberg contraptions that don\u2019t pay off until she\u2019s ready. To a degree, Jeunet\u2019s Paris doesn\u2019t need Am\u00e9lie to syncopate to a pleasing rhythm, as he delights in the random, unrelated events around the fertilization that led to her birth nine months later. Raised as an only child whose sole friend is a \u201csuicidal fish\u201d that leaps out of its bowl, Am\u00e9lie grows into a passive, self-effacing adult who comes to realize that she can shape the destinies of those around her without making herself visible. And so, she returns those childhood trinkets to the middle-aged man. And she persuades the hypochondriac cashier (Isabelle Nanty) at the cafe to take notice of the regular (Jeunet favorite Dominique Pinon) who always sits across from her station. And she honors her father\u2019s dreams of world travel by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant send back Polaroids of the gnome at various landmarks. And she gets a key to the mean grocer\u2019s apartment and messes with his head by switching his toothpaste with foot cream or swapping out his slippers for a pair a few sizes too small.\nAnd on and on and on. Am\u00e9lie inevitably takes an interest in arranging happiness for herself when she spots a handsome young man named Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has made a hobby out of collecting discarded shots from under photo booth machines. Their courtship is all gestures and delayed gratification, all so beautifully staged that the audience is never invited to imagine what a real relationship between the two of them might be like. It is the ultimate romantic comedy in that respect, imagining nothing worse than a series of contrived obstacles keeping two people from a future of uncomplicated bliss. It\u2019s an extremely seductive fantasy for many, buoyed by the undeniable brio of Jeunet\u2019s film-making. The difference is that Jeunet\u2019s previous fantasies with co-director Marc Caro, the 1991 black comedy Delicatessen and the surrealist 1995 science-fiction City of Lost Children, have a much darker tone to bring them back down to earth. There\u2019s no doubt that Jeunet succeeds in turning this hidden corner of Montmartre, relegated mostly to the denizens of an apartment building and a cafe, into a community of oddballs bound closely together by dazzling orchestration. The experience intends to be a sustained magic act, but it\u2019s more often sickly sweet. As Am\u00e9lie, Tautou does well to suggest the loneliness and fear at the core of her character while still inviting the audience to play co-conspirator to her behind-the-scenes machinations. But Jeunet doesn\u2019t appreciate her human dimension, to say nothing of the other characters, who are defined by silly likes and dislikes and weird patterns of behavior, but feel similarly trapped in his grand design. It\u2019s hard not to feel manipulated by Jeunet in the same elfin way his heroine intervenes in people\u2019s lives. The intent may be benevolent, but you\u2019re still getting jerked around.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/02/amelie-audrey-tautou-paris-jean-pierre-jeunet", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:16:20Z", "source": "Guardian"},

In the race against time to avert dangerous global heating, the UK government has decided to back an untried reactor from Rolls Royce. The first of these could be \u201cplugged into the grid by 2031\u201d, according to Nuclear Industry Association. Internationally average planning time for reactor proposals is 10 years, plus another decade for building, and that is for already proven designs.

Apart from other possible objections the favoured UK coastal locations are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion and storms. Faced with the well-documented delays and drawbacks to nuclear programmes it is perhaps not surprising that there is no other country taking part in the Cop26 process in Glasgow relying on multiple new nuclear reactors to get to net zero carbon targets by 2050.

{"title": "Tackling deforestation must be at the heart of our response to the climate crisis | Zac Goldsmith", "article": "This morning, at the all-important Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, the prime minister is urging world leaders to commit to take radical action to reverse the catastrophic degradation of the world\u2019s forests. It is hard to exaggerate the importance of what he is asking. Put simply, there is no credible response to the climate crisis \u2013 or to so many of the biggest challenges we face \u2013 that does not involve protecting and restoring nature on a massive scale. That shouldn\u2019t need saying, but modern industrial society is only just beginning to comprehend, let alone internalise, what indigenous peoples have always known: our lives and economies, our cultures and identities, are indivisibly connected with the natural world. Globally, nature-based solutions such as forests, mangroves and peatlands could provide about a third of the most effective and cost-effective solutions to the climate crisis that we need now \u2013 as well as helping communities adapt to the changes that are now inevitable. But currently, they attract just 3% of total global climate finance. That makes no sense at all. If we were to lose any of the world\u2019s great forests, we would have zero chance of stabilising the world\u2019s climate, of staying within 1.5C of warming, of reversing the catastrophic loss of wildlife. And the damage we are doing is catastrophic. We lose about 30 football pitches of forest every single minute, destroying complex natural systems that sustain hundreds of millions of people. But the flipside is that by scaling up our efforts to protect and restore nature, we are not only tackling the climate emergency, but poverty, extinctions, even pandemics. That\u2019s why, as holders of the Cop26 presidency, we have put nature at the heart of our response to the climate crisis, and why Boris Johnson is demanding action today. The UK has built a coalition of countries all committed to ending deforestation by the end of this decade. More than 100 countries have signed our Glasgow leaders\u2019 declaration on forests and land use, representing 85% of the world\u2019s forests \u2013 that\u2019s an area of more than 13m sq miles. On their own, such declarations are not enough, but we have also mobilised unprecedented finance commitments \u2013 $19.2bn, including $12bn from governments, for our global forest finance pledge, at least $7.2bn of private investment and billions of dollars from philanthropists. As part of that, we have formed an alliance between donor countries and the long-overlooked Congo basin \u2013 with at least $1.5bn pledged for this biodiversity jewel that is the second largest tropical forest in the world. And we have pressed the big multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, to commit not only to aligning their policies with the Paris goals, but to reconciling their entire portfolios with nature. It is right to insist that the public money we invest through them should support the public good, not undermine it. Currently, incentives in favour of destroying forests outstrip incentives to protect them by 40 to 1. So we are using every lever we have to increase investment from all sources \u2013 public, private and philanthropic \u2013 to shift those incentives towards renewal. We have secured a public commitment from the world\u2019s biggest buyers of commodities that they will stop buying produce that has been grown on deforested land. So even countries that have been unwilling to address deforestation will struggle to ignore the signal this sends them. And because commodity production is responsible for the overwhelming majority of deforestation, we have assembled 28 key producer and consumer countries representing three-quarters of global trade in products such as palm oil, soya, cocoa, beef and timber to commit to breaking the link between agricultural commodity supply chains and deforestation \u2013 as we are doing through legislation here in the UK.\nIn addition, leading financial institutions, in charge of about $8.7tn of assets, will commit publicly to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation from their portfolios, to support the shift towards the sustainable production of agricultural commodities and, crucially, to disclose fully the progress they make. We are rallying donors to invest in high-integrity carbon markets so we can recognise and reward those countries that are keeping their forests intact, as well as helping others to move from deforestation towards renewal \u2013 with $1bn and counting secured through a new programme called Leaf. Finally, if we want to protect and restore nature at scale, we need to back the indigenous communities that have defended their forest homes for generations, without meaningful support or recognition and often in the face of chronic danger. Indigenous people\u2019s lands are home to more than a third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes and almost a quarter of the carbon stored in the world\u2019s tropical forests. And today, we have secured $1.7bn to help those communities secure tenure of the land that is by rights already theirs. Of course, we know well that promises are only valuable in so far as they are honoured, and that the gap between where we are now and where we need to be by the end of this decade is vast. So in the weeks, months and years ahead, the UK will do everything we can to maintain momentum, inject real accountability and catalyse action. But combined, the commitments to protect the world\u2019s forests made at Cop26 in Glasgow today go far, far beyond anything we have seen before, and represent the turning point we urgently need for our forests, and by extension for our shared future.

We\u2019re in the cafe at his gym and he is in workout gear. It\u2019s true, something about the language and the before and after pictures from his physical transformation \u2013 severely overweight to lean and chiselled \u2013 would appear familiar from thousands of adverts and magazine spreads, if it wasn\u2019t for one thing; Jones got into the best shape of his adult life after he passed 50. \u201cOn 9 August 2019, I walked in here. I was 54 and 127kg [20st].\u201d He worked out at least six days a week, for 90 minutes or more at a time. \u201cI immersed myself in everything, I did gym, I did classes, Pilates, I even did barre,\u201d he says. Within eight or 10 weeks, he was able to stop taking painkillers for a shoulder injury. He now cycles and runs on top of his gym sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s just a habit \u2013 I brush my teeth every day, I go for a run every day.\u201d This new, dramatic fitness coupled with a weight loss programme (Jones lost 43kg (6st 11lb) in eight months) has been transformative in ways that don\u2019t show in pictures. \u201cI enjoy the feeling of being able to walk upstairs and not getting out of breath, of being fit and strong,\u201d he says. The effect on his self-image was equally dramatic: \u201cIt changed how I think about myself. I didn\u2019t realise how you feel about the world, how you interact with people, is so tied to your body image.\u201d Now on the dating scene after a separation, he is bursting with new-found confidence. What combination of factors leads anyone to go all out at the gym, become a marathon runner or walk miles a day after the age of 50? Motivation is complex, and people differ, but the fact that mortality is nibbling at your heels, midlife restlessness has set in and with it the desire for reinvention, alongside a shift from active parenting or full-time work, may all contribute. Sometimes, a low-level unease gradually crystallises into a sense of urgency. \u201cI had this sense that if I didn\u2019t do something soon, it would be too late,\u201d says Jones. Timing, he thinks, is key. Having retired early from his job as a chief information officer for a police force, the time was right. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to work, so I was my project \u2013 I was my work, really.\u201d Not every super-fit person over 50 has a clear \u201cpush\u201d. Mags Cook wasn\u2019t particularly looking to lose weight or get fit. \u201cI was always quite a busy person \u2013 I didn\u2019t sit around too much,\u201d she says. A retired teacher, Cook, 69, only started running properly at 59 when a friend encouraged her to try parkrun, the national weekly free fun run. \u201cMy husband died in 2006 and it was a good thing to know I\u2019d be doing it every Saturday.\u201d She enjoyed it, and her son-in-law suggested she join a running club. \u201cI thought it was the most hilarious idea, because I was coming up to 60 and didn\u2019t think of myself as a runner. But it was the best thing I\u2019ve done \u2013 it was amazing.\u201d\nCook runs three or four times a week, and says: \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too impressed, I don\u2019t go fast or anything.\u201d She is being modest \u2013 she has completed two marathons and a triathlon, for which she took swimming lessons to learn front crawl, and rode a bike for the first time since childhood. \u201cI thought: \u2018Might as well have a go,\u2019\u201d she says. The triathlon meant open-water swimming. \u201cI cannot tell you how terrified I was \u2026 but, actually, after the swim I was completely elated that I\u2019d done something I didn\u2019t think could do.\u201d While getting fit was not the end in itself for Cook, she can feel the difference now. \u201cWhen I started running, I couldn\u2019t do more than 50 metres without collapsing, but you discover you don\u2019t have to run fast all the time \u2013 you can just keep going.\u201d For Shashi Hussain, 53, staying sane rather than getting fit motivated her to start a walking regime in the first Covid-19 lockdown. \u201cI\u2019m quite sociable and being locked in my house, not being able to meet my friends and family, I found it really tough, so I decided to turn it into some sort of positive.\u201d She began to walk daily, using the time to call friends and family to catch up. Gradually she went up from 5,000 steps to 10,000, \u201cthen 12,000, then 15,000; now I do anything between 20,000 and 30,000 steps a day\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a significant time commitment: Hussain is an NHS manager, and splits her daily step count into a walk before work, one at lunchtime and more steps after work. She walks the streets and parks around her home in Essex, often combining exercise with errands, exploring new areas or taking photographs. \u201cI\u2019ve turned it into a bit of a learning exercise; I\u2019ve learned so much about plants and flowers.\u201d She has also lost weight, gone through two pairs of trainers and transformed her fitness. \u201cMy husband has always walked really fast. Before, I\u2019d almost have to run to catch up with him, but he sees a difference in my breathing, my walking \u2013 I\u2019m not out of breath.\u201d For both women, the mental benefits have been crucial during the pandemic. Cook\u2019s running club set members running tasks during lockdown: \u201cThey kept us going, it was brilliant. It really made lockdown so different.\u201d \u201cFor my mental wellbeing, it\u2019s been the best thing ever,\u201d says Hussain, who has surprised herself with her unwavering commitment. It\u2019s almost a compulsion: if her step count is lower at weekends, she sometimes goes back out when her husband is asleep. \u201cIt has become part of my life.\u201d For Cook: \u201cIt has made me braver, I think.\u201d While Cook, Jones and Hussain may be in the best shape of their lives, the same is not true of everyone in their age group: 42% of over-55s are inactive, compared with 29% of UK adults, according to Sport England research. Perhaps that is not surprising, when the fitness industry often appears to be tailored to the young. Chris Zaremba is very aware of that. Another convert to super-fitness after 50, he is a personal trainer who specialises in the over-50s. He coined the term \u201cgymtimidation\u201d to describe how many older people feel about fitness clubs. \u201cA new gym opens in your town and, guess what, they are playing loud music, there are loads of mirrors and industrial grungy design \u2013 it\u2019s not welcoming for anybody over 40, which is really stupid.\u201d Jones agrees: \u201cYou think they\u2019re judging you.\u201d He tried and disliked other gyms (\u201cjust a room with kit and pumping music\u201d) before finding a small, supportive one. At 50, Zaremba himself was \u201callergic to exercise\u201d and very overweight; his first experiences in the gym were typically off-putting. \u201cEveryone there was already several times fitter than I was,\u201d he says. But he conquered his misgivings in spectacular style: he has run marathons and a triathlon, and in 2014 won the world championships in both fitness and muscle modelling (similar to bodybuilding). His recent book, Fat to Fit at Fifty, describes his journey and provides training tips. Getting fit after 50 is an optimistic act; a positive statement of intent for the second half of your life. \u201cI hear time and time again: \u2018It\u2019s too late for me to start,\u2019\u201d says Zaremba. \u201cI say, no, it\u2019s not. I did not exercise at all when I was 50 and by the time I was 55, I was one of the healthiest 55-year-olds on the planet.\u201d Most of his clients have gentler aspirations. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining independent living for longer; being mobile, living a happy, independent life.\u201d Is there a risk that extraordinary stories such as Zaremba\u2019s might discourage rather than inspire? \u201cHeadlines like: \u2018Anyone can run a marathon\u2019 are not fair because it\u2019s not actually true,\u201d says Dr Lucy Pollock, a consultant in geriatric medicine and author of The Book About Getting Older (For People Who Don\u2019t Want to Talk About It). But getting fit after 50 need not mean becoming a ropey-calved cycling obsessive in Lycra or signing up for the Marathon des Sables. \u201cI think depictions of older people getting fitter fall into two camps,\u201d says Kate Dale of Sport England; its Active Ageing campaign funds projects that target inactivity in older people. \u201cIt\u2019s either chairobics stuff or you\u2019ve got marathon runners, like the Skipping Sikh. He\u2019s amazing, but you don\u2019t have to go to one of those extremes, you can find what\u2019s right for you.\u201d This is vital because, as Pollock\u2019s book highlights, research shows that activity can improve longevity and, crucially, quality of life for older people, including the group she describes as the \u201csuper old\u201d. One of the best parts of her job, Pollock says, is seeing someone very fragile, with poor mobility, regain strength and the ability to move independently. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly small amounts of exercise make a difference. There are lots of people who are never going to be able to do a squat again \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Brian Nathan can\u2019t do a full pli\u00e9 (pretty close to a squat, but much more elegant), but at 82, he goes down on one leg at a time at his Silver Swans class, a Royal Academy of Dance initiative for over-55 ballet beginners and returners. Nathan started three years ago. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to exercise\u2019, but I loathe exercise and hate ploughing up and down a swimming pool, so what is there in the dancing world?\u201d He finds it \u201cimpossibly difficult\u201d, but says: \u201cWhat is marvellous about the teachers of Silver Swans is that they understand we are old and don\u2019t make us relentlessly go on and on.\u201d\nAn accomplished ballroom dancer in his youth (\u201cI discovered girls love dancing so it was simple: become a decent dancer\u201d), Nathan also played cricket and rugby. But with six children and a successful tool-and-equipment hire business, \u201cit petered out\u201d. Now, though, his weekly regime puts mine to shame. \u201cOn Monday, I do old gits cricket and old gits tennis \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant. Tuesday, I have a rest, Wednesday, I do Move to the Musicals (another Royal Academy dance class), Thursdays I rest again and Fridays I do ballet.\u201d Nathan says he has improved. \u201cI\u2019m motivated to try and get better because I love trying to be graceful to music \u2013 and totally failing; I still want to try every week. We were walking this morning, and walking as a ballet dancer walks is hard. I can remember trying to do it three years ago and I couldn\u2019t; I thought good God, I\u2019m better at it. I can see the point, you know.\u201d There are as many ways to get moving, and what works will depend on individual circumstances and health, resources, time and inclination. \u201cIt\u2019s about forgiving yourself to some degree,\u201d says Pollock. \u201cAccepting your limits and working within them.\u201d For those who are ready to take on a challenge, Zaremba recommends trying to incorporate some resistance work as well as an activity that raises the heart rate (he is another parkrun fan). It\u2019s important, he says, to try and fight sarcopenia, the process of losing skeletal muscle mass as we age (Pollock also recommends light weights, perhaps using a tin of beans). Flexibility, mobility and coordination work can also be improved hugely in later life and have day-to-day benefits, in staying agile and preventing falls. This can be quite modest: Zaremba recommends doorframe stretches as a good simple starter. However gentle your exercise regime, advises Pollock, give yourself credit as you improve. \u201cNotice that you\u2019re better at it this week than last week. Give yourself a pat on the back and notice how far you have come in a very short time.\u201d As an additional bonus, the fitness efforts of people over 50 seem to have a powerful trickle-down effect on friends and family. Cook has converted several friends to running and runs with her daughter; Hussain has inspired her friends. \u201cA lot of people have started doing it with me, which is brilliant.\u201d Even her mother, who is 76, now walks 10,000 to 15,000 steps a day. \u201cShe says I\u2019ve really helped her because otherwise, she\u2019d have nothing to do.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a role model in any way,\u201d says Jones, \u201cBut both my boys in their early 20s now take better care of themselves. I think there has been a kind of shared awakening.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/02/second-act-sensations-meet-the-people-who-reached-peak-fitness-after-turning-50", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:48:41Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Gemma Whelan: \u2018Sex in Game of Thrones could be a frenzied mess\u2019", "article": "Deadlines meant I saw ITV\u2019s twisty police corruption drama The Tower as a rough cut, featuring on-screen notes about final editing perfections, computer-generated backgrounds, extra lines of dialogue \u2013 and the instruction: \u201cHide pregnancy bump.\u201d This related to the increasing evidence of Freddie, now four weeks old, and sleeping between feeds in a pub garden near the London home of his mother, Gemma Whelan, who is amused to hear of this prenatal technology. \u201cWow!\u201d she says. \u2018\u201cHow are they going to do that? Paint it out? Or cut in a waistline from earlier?\u201d Despite high-level acting credits \u2013 including Yara Greyjoy in Game of Thrones and Kate in BBC Two\u2019s Upstart Crow \u2013 the 40-year-old says she is never recognised in the street: \u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Do I know you from the bus stop?\u2019 or, \u2018Were we at school?\u2019 That\u2019s it really.\u201d Whelan enjoys her ability to transform into her her characters, whether with Yara\u2019s breastplate, war paint and mouthy scowl \u2013 \u201cit would be almost insulting to be recognised from Game of Thrones\u201d \u2013 or, in BBC One\u2019s The Moorside, as Karen Matthews, the Yorkshire woman jailed for faking the abduction of her daughter, so physically transformed that it fooled Whelan\u2019s mum. \u201cShe said: \u2018Strange they used so much original footage of her!\u2019, and I said: \u2018That\u2019s all me, Mum. There is no original footage.\u2019\u201d\nWhelan is taking minimal maternity leave partly because she is self-employed but also because, like most actors, she endured a year during lockdown of not doing very much. A West End version of Upstart Crow was shut down three weeks into the run, after which she spent \u201ca year doing audiobooks and voiceovers\u201d. She then filmed next year\u2019s second series of BBC One\u2019s Gentleman Jack \u2013 playing Marian, the sister of Anne Lister \u2013 before The Tower. The main shoot lasted through the second trimester. With actors who are visibly pregnant when their characters are not, the convention has been to shoot them mainly from the neck up. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s a great way of getting loads of closeups!\u201d laughs Whelan who, during the final season of Game of Thrones, was carrying Frances, now four. \u201cBut there also were a lot of wide shots in The Tower. I think you\u2019d only notice if you knew I was pregnant and, if you do notice, women have babies, who cares? It was refreshing to be able to not worry about it.\u201d\nWhelan\u2019s domestic juggling starkly contrasts with DS Sarah Collins in The Tower, who has no visible private life. \u201cShe\u2019s very moral, very black and white. There\u2019s very little nuance in her judgment.\u201d Viewers may be reminded of Adrian Dunbar\u2019s Supt Ted Hastings in Line of Duty, and Whelan admits the similarity: \u201cAbsolutely. They swore an oath to keep the law and so they do. She doesn\u2019t care about being a people-pleaser, which I think a lot of women are written as \u2013 and, actually, a lot of women are \u2013 but I like that she\u2019s very front-footed and doesn\u2019t mind pissing people off.\u201d Adapted by 24 screenwriter Patrick Harbinson, from a series of novels by former Met detective Kate London, The Tower goes out at a time when, after the murder by a serving police officer of Sarah Everard, the reputation of the force is as low as it\u2019s ever been. But, like Line of Duty, The Tower shows good and bad policing. \u201cYes. Exactly,\u201d says Whelan. \u201cMost of the cops are trying to do their best, but some aren\u2019t; there are wrong \u2019uns.\u201d As with all current TV productions, The Tower had a Covid-safe set, with testing mandatory and jabs encouraged \u2013 a difficult decision for Whelan at a time when medical evidence on safety during pregnancy was sketchy. Stressing that she is not telling others what to do but sharing her own thought processes in a dilemma that many face, she says: \u201cI\u2019m double-vaxxed, and had both while I was pregnant. I spoke to the midwife and doctors at length, and read all the stories about the huge number of American pregnant women who had been jabbed without incident. And I knew if I got Covid in the third trimester it could be very serious. It\u2019s not an easy decision but I felt comfortable to make it and we\u2019re both fine.\u201d\nAnother question of film-set safety has arisen since the revelations about Harvey Weinstein and other showbiz predators. Whelan says that she has never experienced any threats or assaults, but the mood of shoots has noticeably changed. \u201cThere\u2019s a very different choice of language now. If anyone makes an innuendo, everyone shuts down. I think, five or 10 years ago, if there was a double entendre, everyone would jump on the bandwagon and see how many laughs they could raise. I remember when an actor would have a microphone fitted, and sometimes you have to root around the waist. And, in the past, there\u2019d be all this, \u2018and while you\u2019re down there, hur, hur!\u2019 But now you don\u2019t have to play along with things like that.\u201d In the past, it was common for actors, saying hello or goodbye to colleagues, to exchange embraces of a level some married couples never reach. But first #MeToo and then Covid-19 have ended that. \u201cAll the squishy-squishy, huggy-huggy stuff has stopped. But I don\u2019t miss it. You have to be a bit more genuine now if you\u2019re saying hello. You can\u2019t hide behind a big hug. And there\u2019s no question mark over it: Do we double kiss? Do we hug? Clasp hands? No, we just say hello to each other.\u201d Although DS Collins\u2019s workaholism prevents her having sex in The Tower, an intimacy director is credited for couples who do. Presumably, when Whelan was playing the energetically bisexual Yara in Game of Thrones, actors were just left to get on with it? \u201cAlmost literally. They used to just say, \u2018When we shout action, go for it!\u2019, and it could be a sort of frenzied mess. But between the actors there was always an instinct to check in with each other. There was a scene in a brothel with a woman and she was so exposed that we talked together about where the camera would be and what she was happy with. A director might say, \u2018Bit of boob biting, then slap her bum and go!\u2019, but I\u2019d always talk it through with the other actor.\u201d\nIn the 2012 second season (her first) of Game of Thrones, Yara and Theon (Alfie Allen) had one of TV\u2019s most talked-about sex-scenes (retrospectively revealed to be incestuous) sharing a horse-ride including a reach-round move that would bring immediate disqualification in dressage. \u201cAlfie was very much, \u2018Is this OK? How are we going to make this work?\u2019 With intimacy directors, it\u2019s choreography \u2013 you move there, I move there, and permission and consent is given before you start. It is a step in the right direction.\u201d With Yara, Shakespeare\u2019s Kate, and now DS Collins, Whelan has repeatedly played spectacularly strong women. \u201cThat seems to be what casting directors see in me.\u201d Possibly because there is something sharp and sardonic about her? \u201cMaybe. I think I may give off a \u2018don\u2019t fuck with me\u2019 vibe. There\u2019s definitely a defiance.\u201d And has that always been there? \u201cMy mum says I\u2019ve always been astonishingly wilful and stubborn. But it seems to come out more in the acting. In real life, I\u2019m quite apologetic, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry to take up your time, thank you so much for getting me a tea,\u2019 and so on. But, in my work, I feel that\u2019s where I belong and have a right to be there.\u201d\nShe may have inherited performing genes from parents who met in an amateur dramatics production of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Desire Under the Elms in Birmingham. Living there and in Leeds and London has given her access to a useful range of regional accents, but she would like to test her American: \u201cI\u2019d love to do something in America. I went up for a film there with Frances McDormand, but didn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s my next ambition.\u201d She is about to film a small role in another ITV police drama, DI Ray, starring Parminder Nagra, and hopes that the Upstart Crow play will return to the West End next year. Combining this workload with family life is possible because her husband, Gerry Howell, a standup comic retraining as a therapist, shares childcare, but also because productions are more baby-friendly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a creche on set. But, even with my first baby, breastfeeding was never an issue. People would say, \u2018Just go when you have to go.\u2019 But I think you have to meet them halfway. I don\u2019t think, after they\u2019ve set up an elaborate shot, you can say, \u2018Right I\u2019m off!\u2019\u201d The Tower is on ITV on 8, 9 and 10 November at 9pm.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/02/gemma-whelan-sex-game-of-thrones-frenzied-mess-tower-innuendo", "last_update": "2021-11-02T07:30:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Parallel metaverses: Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta might meet a trademark challenge from META PCs", "article": "Meta PCs, an Arizona-based company that sells computers, laptops and software for gamers was an unremarkable retail outfit a week ago. Then on Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his company would be changing its name to Meta and it found itself in an IP war with tech\u2019s biggest behemoth. Lucky for Meta PCs, it\u2019s already a few months ahead of Facebook in having the name trademarked. According to a document shared by TMZ, the company filed for its trademark in August, a little over a year after it was started. Zack Shutt, one of the founders of Meta PCs, told the Guardian that the company was registered in November of last year, and their team was unaware about Facebook\u2019s plans to use \u201cMeta\u201d in any part of its rebranding until last week. Shutt, along with co-founder Joe Darger, told TMZ they won\u2019t sell the name for less than $20m if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries to get the name. Shutt declined to further comment on this to the Guardian, citing legal concerns. Facebook did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comments, but someone affiliated with the company told TMZ that they are not too worried and they have the required rights to acquire the name. Mark P McKenna, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Law, says even though Meta PCs has made an application to trademark its name, there are loopholes that may allow Facebook to acquire the name. One such measure is filing an application in another country and using that application date to file in the US \u2013 a practice often used by big companies. \u201cThey look for a little country without a searchable system and then file there,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat would be a way for them to have an earlier date.\u201d He added that trademark registration doesn\u2019t define rights of a company in the US in this regard. \u201cIn the US, rights aren\u2019t created by trademark registration \u2013 the rights arise out of use,\u201d he said. So it remains to be seen how this tug of war will pan out, especially given Meta PCs would be up against a giant like Facebook. Schutt was unable to share information such as the value of the company, but said they\u2019re a small organization with only 25 employees. \u201cWe\u2019ve bootstrapped this company with our own personal funds. When we learned Facebook chose the same name, it was obviously a concern that we would lose whatever organic reach we had worked hard to build,\u201d Shutt said, adding that they have \u201csizable investments\u201d in branded content and influencer marketing in the works. Despite this looming concern, the company is finding fun ways to acknowledge the situation. On Thursday, Shutt shared a video making a parody announcement similar to the one Zuckerberg made when sharing the new name:\n\u201cTo reflect who we are and what we hope to build I\u2019m proud to announce that we are now Facebook,\u201d Shutt says in the video. In another tweet, they photoshopped Zuckerberg holding their product:\nFacebook\u2019s announcement about its new name has already sparked a flurry of response \u2013 from many ridiculing its scope to the revelation that the word means \u201cdeath\u201d in Hebrew.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/02/meta-parallel-metaverses-facebook-name-change-challenged", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:07:35Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Zac Goldsmith hails \u2018unprecedented\u2019 deal at Cop26 to save world\u2019s forests", "article": "Saving the world\u2019s forests will be one of the cornerstone achievements of the Cop26 climate summit, the UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith has said, with some of the biggest forested nations and consumers of forestry products signing up to an \u201cunprecedented\u201d conservation deal. On Tuesday, more than 100 world leaders will commit to halting and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030, backed by nearly \u00a314bn in public and private funding. Major producers and consumers of deforestation-linked commodities including Indonesia, China, Brazil and the US have put their name to the deal, which aims to curtail the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Lord Goldsmith told the Guardian: \u201cThis is a genuinely unprecedented package. People will be able to justify having hope [that the world\u2019s forests can be saved]. This puts us on a road to recovery and renewal.\u201d He said it had \u201cnot been easy\u201d to persuade many of the countries involved to join, as the deal requires not just a commitment to halt deforestation \u2013 which has never been achieved before, despite numerous failed attempts \u2013 and provide forested countries with funds to replace the money they would have made from exploiting forested land, but also to reforming aspects of commodity markets so that buyers cannot get away with importing commodities produced from deforested land. \u201cThe different parts of the package are mutually reinforcing,\u201d said Goldsmith. \u201cWe are sending a very serious signal to the markets, we have a good pledge from buyers. The market has been blind to the value of the environment \u2026 The [current economic] incentives to deforest are 40 times bigger than the incentives to keep healthy forests, so changing that is difficult.\u201d\nThe line-up of countries includes China and Brazil, as well as smaller developing countries, and some big buyers of forestry products which will clean up their supply chains. \u201cThere are some surprising countries in there, and this is a pretty bullish pledge,\u201d said the Conservative peer, though he declined to name any countries. \u201cWe have managed to persuade some of the trickier customers to come on board.\u201d Goldsmith, son of the late billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, has long been a notable environmentalist, a former owner of the Ecologist magazine and a campaigner and philanthropist for conservation projects. His political career as an MP, which included a campaign running against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan to be London mayor that was marred by accusations of Islamophobia, was ended by defeat in the 2019 election. Soon afterwards he was put in the Lords, controversially, by Boris Johnson. He was charged by Johnson, an old friend and fellow old Etonian, with what he said was a personal passion for protecting nature and combating the loss of species and habitats. \u201cPutting nature at the heart [of the Cop] has been my obsession. It\u2019s mad that nature has always been more or less forgotten [in climate negotiations],\u201d said Goldsmith.\nThe difficulty of achieving the broader deal hoped for at Cop26, of drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in line with scientific advice, was apparent on the first day of the summit, when more than 120 world leaders gathered in Glasgow. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, delivered a gloomy forecast of the prospects. \u201cRecent climate action announcements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an illusion.\u201d In this context, having a side deal on forestry in the bag is a major boost for the UK as hosts. However, some countries and analysts told the Guardian the agreement, while important, was flawed and lacking in some key respects, with too little cash being dedicated to helping poor countries preserve their forests, and too little emphasis on reducing demand for the commodities \u2013 such as soy, palm oil and beef \u2013 that drive deforestation in the first place. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: \u201cEveryone wants to see zero deforestation, not least the indigenous peoples whose homes and livelihoods are under threat. But without tackling the drivers of destruction it\u2019s like whistling in the wind to think cash alone will work. Cattle and soya for animal feed are wiping out the Amazon and savannahs of Brazil. The industrial meat industry, like its counterpart in the fossil fuel sector, needs to come to an end.\u201d He added: \u201cEvery climate scientist is saying we need to eat less meat. We won\u2019t save the forests until politicians stop ignoring that message.\u201d Indigenous leaders, who have been shown to be the best guardians of the natural world by several studies, have also said they were not consulted on the declaration, adding that many leaders making the commitment had a history of breaking promises on protecting indigenous rights. Goldsmith said the deal would benefit forest dwellers. \u201cIndigenous people have always been seen as second tier [at Cops], they have never been given this support before,\u201d he said. \u201cI think for them this support will be a turning point at this Cop.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen you put it all together, it\u2019s a robust package, trying to get as many major countries together as possible to commit to ending deforestation. But it\u2019s worth nothing unless they back this up with policies. It will be our job to make this real.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/zac-goldsmith-hails-unprecedented-deal-at-cop26-to-save-worlds-forests", "last_update": "2021-11-02T09:28:30Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Branded a \u2018liar\u2019 by the French, Scott Morrison\u2019s slipperiness is now on show for the world to see | Hugh Riminton", "article": "Slipperiness is Scott Morrison\u2019s defining characteristic. And it was never more on show than this week as he sold \u201cthe Australian Way\u201d on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while being openly branded a liar by France over submarines. Take the stoush with Emmanuel Macron. When asked if Morrison had lied to him about dumping the $90bn Attack-class submarine contract, the French president said tartly: \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know.\u201d Morrison denied it, before an instant pivot to a baseless claim about the journalists.\n\u201cYou were getting selfies with him.\u201d No, we weren\u2019t, said an indignant hack. \u201cI must have been misinformed,\u201d Morrison replied. All ridiculously trivial, but not quite innocent. When cornered, the Australian prime minister breaks the glass and reaches for distraction. Remember in March, when under pressure over the culture in parliament house, he suddenly turned on Sky News, warning about \u201cglass houses\u201d. \u201cRight now, you would be aware that in your own organisation there is a person who had had a complaint made against them for harassment of a woman in a women\u2019s toilet,\u201d thundered Morrison. Not true, said Sky\u2019s owners at News Corp. The prime minister issued a late night withdrawal. \u201cThe emotion of the moment is no excuse,\u201d he said. Morrison\u2019s next reactions to Macron were also interesting. \u201cI have a lot of respect for your country,\u201d Macron said, making plain he blamed Morrison specifically for what he contends was a lie. \u201cA lot of respect and friendship for your people.\u201d\nMorrison\u2019s response was to defend Australia\u2019s honour, citing his own \u201cbroad shoulders\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cop sledging of Australia. I am not going to cop that on behalf of Australians.\u201d Then, in an extraordinary breach of normal protocols, a personal text message from the French president was selectively leaked to the press. We now know that two days before the Aukus announcement, Macron texted Morrison to ask: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarine ambitions?\u201d This is being presented as evidence Macron knew the contract was about to be torn up. But Morrison\u2019s fuller explanation subverts that reading. In mid-June, Morrison says he flew to Paris for dinner with Macron to state \u201ccandidly \u2026 that a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia\u2019s strategic requirements\u201d. But whatever he now says he said, what the French plainly heard was merely that there were problems with costs and delays. On Morrison\u2019s own account, \u201cthe French defence system swung into full action\u201d, sending an admiral to Australia to respond \u201cto the issues that I had raised at our dinner\u201d. Back then, Morrison publicly thanked the French president for \u201ctaking a very active role\u201d in resolving the submarine issues. Morrison\u2019s own account shows French actions consistent with a partner trying to fix issues, rather than one who had been told its services were no longer required. In essence, Morrison now says \u201cthey knew\u201d. Macron says \u201che lied\u201d. It appears the French knew less than they thought about Australia\u2019s intentions, up to the virtual eve of the Aukus announcement. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear from president macron\u2019s statements yesterday that the level of offence is still very great,\u201d Morrison conceded in a moment of clarity in Glasgow.\nSo Morrison slipped and slid through the French submarine contract until he was ready to announce his nuclear partnership with the US and UK. As he slipped and slid to the prime ministership in 2018, activating a tightly held plan to come through the pack. He out-energised Bill Shorten to claim victory in 2019, in part by convincing pensioners that Labor\u2019s franking credit reforms would leave them worse off. The man who carried coal into parliament now has a net zero pamphlet that he believes can win back voters concerned about a warming planet. The electric vehicles which he claimed would destroy the Aussie weekend are now built into his emissions reduction goals. The man who said cutting emissions would destroy the economy now argues the opposite. As emissions have fallen by 20% since 2005, our economy has grown by 45%, he says, \u201cproving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions reduction\u201d. And we now have a new moral reason to export coal. We\u2019re helping the world\u2019s poor, he said in Rome. \u201cDon\u2019t force up the cost,\u201d he begged. \u201cThat is only going to hurt the people who can afford it least.\u201d If slipperiness defines him, it is also his primary political skill. Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s biographer Kenneth Davis says the former US president had little time for politicians \u201cwho pursued their objectives in uncompromisingly straight lines, men who disdain(ed) cajolery and concealment and misdirection\u201d. As Turnbull, Dutton and now Macron can attest, those who have underestimated Morrison have been left clawing at the open air. Less chameleon than oiled seal, he has already slipped them by.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/branded-a-liar-by-the-french-scott-morrisons-slipperiness-is-now-on-show-for-the-world-to-see", "last_update": "2021-11-02T05:38:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Country diary: How crows make the rowan trees grow", "article": "The rowan trees opposite my office are now devoid of either leaf or fruit, but from August until recently they have been centres of intense activity for jackdaws, rooks, carrion crows and even magpies. The birds crowded the tops or chased each other through the foliage while they feasted daily on the red fruits. I had never previously noticed the connection between rowan berries and corvids. These observations, in turn, helped me to understand an older puzzle, because on the slopes along the high moorland edge, the ground had been sown with 30 young rowans. I\u2019d previously credited this habitat creation to another tree-planting group, the thrushes. In their wonderful book Birds and Berries, Barbara and David Snow suggest that blackbirds were the chief consumers and propagators of rowans in their Hertfordshire study area. Here, however, it\u2019s a far less beloved black bird that is the creative force. A third piece in the ecological jigsaw was a fragment of Aberdeenshire dialect once recounted to me by a farmer near Turiff. Saplings that spring up mysteriously in that area are known as \u201ccraa-sown\u201d. Now I understand it. Once you are attuned to the rowan-planting efforts of these often despised black creatures, you realise how much we owe them. It turns out that hawthorns are equally popular with members of the crow family, and often the only native trees growing in the infertile soils of the High Peak are these two fruit-bearing bushes. The other name for rowan is mountain ash, and of all trees it is the one most tolerant of high, wind-swept places. It is the crows that we should thank partly for the colour, complexity and texture in parts of our upland landscape. Without them some areas of Derbyshire would almost certainly have no trees at all. If there had previously been doubt about who had sown the 30 young rowans, I am rather more certain about who chopped them down. Last spring it appears someone from a nearby driven-grouse moor took a chainsaw to them and felled the lot. I\u2019m now putting my money on crows as the truer custodians of this landscape. \u2022 Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/country-diary-how-crows-make-the-rowan-trees-grow", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:09:44Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018One of the best singers ever\u2019: remembering Eva Cassidy, 25 years after her death", "article": "On a late May day in 1996, the singer Eva Cassidy and her bandmate Chris Biondo drove to a remote factory in rural Virginia to collect copies of the recording that turned out to be the last she would ever make. \u201cWe picked up a total of about 1,100 cassettes and CDs,\u201d Biondo recalled. \u201cWhen we got in the car, Eva cracked open a box and started getting very worried. She felt she wasn\u2019t going to be able to sell them all. I\u2019ll never forget her comment: \u2018When I\u2019m dead and they find me, there\u2019s going to be boxes of these in my basement,\u2019 she said. Her expectations for the record could not have been more minimal.\u201d\nAfter all, Cassidy had been performing for nearly a decade by then in relative obscurity and, while she had a number of meetings with record company executives in that time, they never went beyond the talking stage. Worse, by the summer of 96, the 33-year-old was facing something dire. Over the course of the next few months, she would receive increasingly grim diagnoses of a cancer that had already begun to make quickening race through her body, robbing her of any chance of making a mark during her time on earth. Given that, who could have foreseen that Cassidy\u2019s music would one day generate a sustained catalogue that would sell in the multi-millions, creating chart hits all over the world? \u201cAt the time, we just hoped to make enough money to buy a PA system,\u201d Biondo said. This week will mark 25 years since Cassidy died of melanoma cancer, just 10 months after recording the live album she and Biondo had driven out to pick up that day. The story that emerged later \u2013 of a talent barely recognized in her lifetime, who went on to achieve rapturous posthumous acclaim \u2013 has become one of the most dramatic bad news/good news tales in pop history. But it never would have happened without the stalwart efforts of some dedicated supporters, as well as several connections that brought her songs to the attention of more media gatekeepers than normally receive credit in the tale. The small label that set things in motion, Blix Street Records, seemed an unlikely engine to power such a success. Before making a deal with Eva\u2019s estate, the imprint had achieved modest sales with recordings by jazz instrumental bands and Celtic singers, the best-selling of whom was Mary Black. It was another singer on the label, Grace Griffith, a friend of Cassidy\u2019s from the Washington DC club scene, who introduced her music to Blix Street chief Bill Straw. \u201cWe have this wonderful nightingale,\u2019\u201d Griffith told him, Straw recalled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to lose her.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as her vocal came on, I felt it was extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I finished the album, I came to the conclusion that this was one of the best singers ever.\u201d Though many have come to similar conclusions since, Biondo was one of the first to do so. He met Cassidy in the winter of 1986 when, on the recommendation of a mutual friend, she came to visit him at his small home recording studio. \u201cShe was afraid to come inside because she had not done any recording like this before,\u201d Biondo said. Once she began to sing, however, he was instantly taken with her natural skill. \u201cA lot of people take lessons to learn music theory and how to do harmonies,\u201d he said. \u201cShe could just do it. I watched her come up with three- or four-part harmonies out of nowhere. She would hear it in her head and then sing anything she heard.\u201d Biondo believes that skill is what freed her to bring so much emotion to the songs. \u201cThere are a lot of components to someone trying to pull off a tune,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to think about the technical parts, about what the next note is and what the phrasing will be. But because those things were so natural to Eva, it allowed her to go right to the next level, which was to go inside the song and feel the lyrics.\u201d Her skill also meant she could improvise the tunes at will, as well as bend the notes with a sculptor\u2019s care. \u201cShe could change the melody to something the band had not heard before on a gig-by-gig basis,\u201d Biondo said. Then there was the sheer sound of her soprano, graced by a tone as plush as fleece. \u201cIt\u2019s the purity of the tone that struck me,\u201d said Rob Burley, who wrote the book Songbird, about Cassidy\u2019s life. \u201cThe unadorned quality of it shines through.\u201d\nAt times, however, the subtlety of her approach, and the quiet intensity of it, could fly over the heads of some audiences. \u201cWe never played loud which was a problem for us,\u201d Biondo said. \u201cOne time, we played this club in southern Maryland and we were doing ballads, country tunes and the clientele was into Lynyrd Skynyrd, so people were leaving. The guy who had hired us to play said, \u2018How about I pay you and you guys go home?\u2019 It\u2019s never a good thing when someone pays you to leave.\u201d On the other hand, Biondo said Cassidy \u201cthought that was kinda cool,\u201d an attitude that underscores her focus on the performance rather than its reception. \u201cShe just liked to go out and sing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want anybody to jump up and down.\u201d Cassidy remained equally cool when it came to meetings with record companies. \u201cMaybe half a dozen companies came down to talk to her,\u201d Biondo said. \u201cBut she never did the kinds of things the people who think they\u2019re going to get a contract do, which is to act all giddy and make fast friends with the A&R people. I don\u2019t think they were too impressed with her enthusiasm level.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s low-key response had two sources: her introverted character, and her concern that the industry might try to squeeze her omnivorous musical taste into a box. When one company executive asked Cassidy what kind of music she wanted to record, she told him, \u201canything but that pop crap,\u201d Burley said. When the prestigious Blue Note Records gave Cassidy\u2019s band a budget of $3,500 to cut six songs, she covered six different genres. \u201cYou could see that the business sense and who the artist is was going to collide,\u201d Biondo said. At one point, Blue Note tried pairing her with a smooth jazz band on the label, Pieces of a Dream, for a few songs but the singer despised the result. A more pleasing proposal came from Apollo Records, run by civil rights activist Percy Sutton, a label connected to the vaunted Harlem-based theater. \u201cThey sent her a contract which meant she could have quit her day job (in a plant nursery) and gotten a yearly salary,\u201d Biondi said. \u201cThat was a dream come true.\u201d Unfortunately, before Cassidy could sign, the company folded. That\u2019s the whole reason Cassidy and her band cut the Live at Blues Alley album. It was essentially a hail-Mary pass to get attention and earn some badly needed cash. Sadly, around the same time a mysterious mole on Cassidy\u2019s back began to raise concerns. Because she hadn\u2019t seen a doctor in years, Biondo insisted she go to his. But she delayed for six months. When she finally went, it instigated a procedure that became far more invasive that was first assumed. The doctor had to take the skin from the back of her neck all the way down her spine in a three-inch-wide swath. While the surgeon thought he caught all the cancer, it came back with a vengeance. \u201cIt was bad news after bad news,\u201d Biondo said. \u201cShe had cancer in her lungs, her brain, her arm, her back.\u201d\nSeveral months of heavy chemotherapy followed, to no avail. In her dying days, Cassidy\u2019s music was brought once again to various labels. And they still turned her down. \u201cThe thing that pisses me off is that there wasn\u2019t anybody smart enough to realize what was there,\u201d said Biondo. \u201cWhen they heard Eva, they should have known.\u201d Bill Straw had heard Cassidy\u2019s music by then; he was invited by Griffith to meet her at a benefit held for the singer two months before her death. But he felt it would be ghoulish for him to attend. Six months after she died, however, he met with her parents. Straw had the advantage of understanding the kind of specialized audience he assumed she could reach at that point. It helped that there were no other serious bidders. Though Cassidy had self-released just three albums in her lifetime \u2013 including a collaboration with DC go-go pioneer Chuck Brown, a solo work, and the live Blues Alley album \u2013 she had some 127 recordings in the can. From that deep trove, Blix Street fashioned an ideal set titled Songbird, which they issued in 1998. A myth has arisen that the album sold nothing until it was picked up by BBC Radio 2 two years later, but, according to Straw, the American press jumped on it quickly, with rave reviews in publications as mainstream as People magazine. Once the label convinced a Boston radio station to play her music, \u201cwe sold 10,000 CDs in that city in two weeks. We kept having these little explosions,\u201d Straw said. The Mount Vesuvius moment, however, came when Blix Street\u2019s associated label in the UK, Hot Records, hired Tony Bramwell, a record promo guy from the 60s who had worked with the Beatles, to promote the music. He took it to the producer of Terry Wogan\u2019s huge morning show on Radio 2. \u201cThey listened because of Tony Bramwell\u2019s lineage,\u201d Burley said. The result instantly resonated with British listeners, generating snowballing sales. Just before Christmas 2000, after Top of the Pops 2 played a blurry video of Cassidy singing Over the Rainbow, the album soared to the top of the UK chart.\nIn the years since, the demand for her music has encouraged the release of no fewer than 12 subsequent albums, consisting of either previously unheard or repackaged performances. This December will see the release of yet another \u2013 a 25th anniversary edition of Live at Blues Alley. Biondo, who is credited as producer on most of her recordings, doesn\u2019t believe that all of that music deserves to be heard. \u201cI don\u2019t think Eva would want it all out,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get the chance to censor her own stuff and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair, especially since she had such strong feelings about people not hearing her at her best.\u201d Even Straw believes one release shouldn\u2019t have happened \u2013 the Wonderful World set from 2004. Still, he said, pressure from the public dictated that release. As to what Cassidy herself would have made of the sheer scale of the attention she has received, Biondo said, \u201cshe would have been scared shitless.\u201d He believes she would have preferred a more measured, and controllable, degree of attention. \u201cI have this day dream about Eva every once in a while,\u201d Biondo mused. \u201cIn the dream, she isn\u2019t dead and she\u2019s as loved as she is now. I see her singing in this little restaurant that\u2019s behind my house. Maybe 40 people can fit in there and she plays there every night and people pay a lot of money to see her. And they\u2019re quiet and they really listen. To her, that would be heaven.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/02/eva-cassidy-singer-songbird-25-years", "last_update": "2021-11-02T19:33:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Australia\u2019s resources minister ignored climate risks in $21m grant to frack NT\u2019s Beetaloo Basin, court hears", "article": "The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, made no effort to assess the impact on global heating of handing $21m to Empire Energy to frack the Beetaloo Basin, despite evidence that exploiting the region\u2019s gas would drive up Australia\u2019s emissions by 13%, a court has heard. The federal court on Tuesday began hearing a challenge to the lawfulness of federal grants designed to incentivise exploratory drilling in the Northern Territory as part of the Morrison government\u2019s gas-led economic recovery. The case, described by litigants Environment Centre NT, as a landmark piece of climate litigation, argues the minister was required to make reasonable inquiries into a range of matters before awarding Empire $21m from the $50m grant program, including the consequences for global heating and Australia\u2019s targets under the Paris climate agreement. Pitt, who is defending his decision, has previously described the case as \u201cgreen lawfare\u201d and said the litigation threatens to delay an estimated 6,000 new jobs for the Northern Territory along with around $37bn in economic activity Perry Herzfeld, SC, \u2013 acting for the Environment Centre NT, which launched the case \u2013 argued on Tuesday that the government\u2019s failure to investigate the climate consequences was \u201cstark\u201d.\n\u201cThere were no inquiries made into climate change risks at all, and, further, no inquiries made into whether such inquiries should be made or deferred until later,\u201d Herzfeld told the court. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the material before your honour which suggests any engagement with this at all.\u201d He showed the court expert evidence suggesting that extracting and using gas from the Beetaloo Basin would use up the rest of Australia\u2019s carbon budget under the Paris agreement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nOn one scenario, it would drive up Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 13%. \u201cWhat\u2019s observed is that combustion of gas from the Beetaloo Basin shale field would equate to a 13% increase on Australia\u2019s 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, these are annual emissions,\u201d he said. Herzfield argued that any activity in the Beetaloo, even exploration, would harm Australia\u2019s prospects of meeting its Paris agreement targets. He also argued it was not clear that the plan for Beetaloo would deliver a net economic benefit to Australia and said there was a risk that it could become a \u201cstranded asset that has failed to deliver a return on investment\u201d. The court also heard that a request for confidentiality over a range of documents linked to the case had been agreed to by the parties due to much of it containing \u201cmarket sensitive information\u201d.\nBut the request caused justice John Griffiths significant concern. \u201cIt just strikes me that the claim for confidentiality is too broad and in some respects unsubstantiated,\u201d he said. In one exchange, the court was taken to Pitt\u2019s announcement of the Beetaloo strategic plan on 17 December 2020, in which he described the basin as the \u201chottest play on the planet\u201d. Griffiths asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the \u2018hottest play on the planet\u2019, Mr Herzfield?\u201d Herzfield suggested the phrase meant that the Beetaloo was the \u201cmost exciting gas resources on the planet at the moment\u201d. Griffiths said: \u201cThe \u2018hottest play\u2019 is not a reference to climate change, I assume?\u201d Herzfield responded \u201cdecidedly not\u201d, prompting Griffiths to quip: \u201cYou didn\u2019t actually have to answer that.\u201d Herzfield is arguing that the failure to properly consider the climate risks meant that the government breached section 71 of the Public Governance, Performance, and Accountability Act 2013, which states that a minister \u201cmust not approve a proposed expenditure of relevant money unless the Minister is satisfied, after making reasonable inquiries, that the expenditure would be a proper use of relevant money\u201d. He argued that should invalidate the grants to Empire. Tom Howe, QC, representing the minister, argued later on Tuesday that the expert evidence did not give any indication of the likely emissions specifically from the three wells Empire wants to use to explore the basin. The purpose of the grants was to fund those wells and those wells only, he said. Howe also argued that a finding that the minister had not reasonably inquired into climate risk did not necessarily mean the grants should be invalidated.

Last month President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan finally ratified the Paris climate agreement, ahead of this week\u2019s Cop26 environmental summit in Glasgow.\nErdo\u011fan faced significant blowback over state mismanagement and unpreparedness after admitting the country had no serviceable firefighting planes. According to Dr Cihan Erd\u00f6nmez, a lecturer at Istanbul university\u2019s forestry department, lessons have been learned across government after the summer fires disaster: a new fleet of planes will be established and the forestry ministry is increasing staffing levels. \u201cHowever, it should not be forgotten that fires will always occur in this geography and the climate crisis will increase the number and impact of fires. Therefore, the real solution should be sought not in extinguishing fires, but in preventing fires,\u201d he said. And while the summer blazes were the biggest in living memory, they are far from the country\u2019s only pressing environmental problem. Also this August, the northern Black Sea region experienced the worst flooding on record, in which 81 people died. The biggest drought in a decade has left major cities with severely depleted water reserves and decimated this year\u2019s wheat, barley and lentil crops; huge dam projects that have drowned traditional life in the majority Kurdish south-east have contributed to the drought problem rather than solved it.\nLarge natural lakes have dried up, killing fish and birds, and rising temperatures in Istanbul\u2019s Sea of Marmara left marine life suffocating under layers of \u201csea snot\u201d released by out-of-control growth of phytoplankton. Europe\u2019s plastic waste, sent to Turkey for recycling, has ended up illegally dumped, burned or thrown in the ocean, while the land has been scarred and polluted by the booming gold, mineral and lignite \u2013 low-quality coal \u2013 mining industries. \u201cTurkish governments dating back to the 1970s have made national energy security and independence a primary goal as Turkey doesn\u2019t have its own gas and black coal resources,\u201d said Deniz G\u00fcm\u00fcsel, an environmental engineer and climate policy expert, who is camped out at a mining protest site not far from Marmaris. \u201cThere is no alternative in strategy other than relying on lignite for another 25 years, which exacerbates all of the problems. The fires and floods were interpreted as part of corruption issues and poor urbanisation policies in the country. [When it comes to climate change] there is still a lot that environmentalists must do to help society connect the dots,\u201d she said. In a speech at the UN last month, Erdo\u011fan made a surprise announcement that the country would finally ratify the Paris agreement on limiting global heating. Despite being the globe\u2019s 16th biggest carbon emitter and a member of the G20, Turkey has dragged its feet on implementing the 2015 international treaty over disagreements on whether it qualified for financial and technical support from wealthier nations. The only other countries yet to join are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Eritrea. It emerged that the Turkish parliament took the final legal step earlier this month after Ankara was offered financial guarantees from several European countries and two development banks. Details on the deal have not yet been published, but environmentalists believe Turkey has probably been extended a large credit line, as was the case with a similar initiative managed by the World Bank for a climate crisis strategy and action plan in 2009. Much of the $2.4bn (\u00a31.7bn) was used to build hydropower plants in the Black Sea region, which have destroyed river systems and were blamed for exacerbating this year\u2019s flooding.\nA small green movement has existed in Turkey for many years, and the 2013 Gezi park protest movement was sparked by plans to redevelop one of Istanbul\u2019s green spaces. But even after a summer of destruction, environmental issues remain low on the political agenda. Turkey\u2019s small Green Left party was joined by a new Green party in 2020. \u201cWe had no rain since March, so of course the fires were related to climate change,\u201d said Mehmet Halil, a resident of Ormaniye who helped organise efforts to house displaced people during the fires. \u201cMarmaris relies on tourists, they come and go, they don\u2019t have to care \u2026 But this is our land. We will protect it.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/turkey-climate-policy-wildfires-floods", "last_update": "2021-11-02T10:32:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "China locks down Shanghai Disneyland and tests 34,000 visitors after single Covid case", "article": "As fireworks lit up the sky over Shanghai Disney Resort on Sunday, chatter began to spread through the crowds. Qian, a young Chinese woman who\u2019d decided to spend her Halloween at the theme park, saw a Weibo alert from Disney saying the park had closed and rides had stopped. No more guests could enter Disneyland \u2013 those already inside, all 34,000 of them, would have to be tested and isolate. The news filtered through the throngs of parkgoers but, as Qian described, caused no panic, despite the worsening outbreak of Delta across 16 Chinese provinces. \u201cThe tourists around me started discussing this matter, but they all finished watching the first fireworks in peace,\u201d she posted on Weibo. As they moved towards the exit, the crowd learned no one could leave until all were tested. They were ushered along outdoor trestle tables staffed by PPE-wearing healthworkers for testing, as the second evening fireworks show blasted in the background. The gates were closed and the rail lines shut down. \u201cI never thought that the longest queue in Disneyland would be for a nucleic acid test,\u201d another visitor wryly noted on social media.\nLate in the night more than 200 buses took people home for two days of self-isolation and further testing. Another 100,000 people who visited the park on the weekend will also be tested. The surreal scenes were prompted by the discovery of one case, a Saturday visitor Shanghai who was later found to be positive. Reports were conflicted on whether she had even gone to Disneyland. Disney\u2019s initial alert had only attributed the closure to a need to \u201ccooperate with the pandemic investigation in other provinces and cities\u201d. Regardless, the park and Disneytown \u2013 its retail hub \u2013 shut until Wednesday.\nOn Monday, China reported another 54 cases in a stubborn outbreak of Delta which, while dwarfed by numbers around the world, is threatening China\u2019s commitment to remaining free from Covid. So far about 500 people have been diagnosed across at least 16 provinces, initially centred around Inner Mongolia but now mostly in Heilongjiang. Throughout the pandemic authorities have responded swiftly and strongly to outbreaks, with sudden lockdowns, transport restrictions and mass testing drives. But the high transmissibility of the Delta variant has seen a rise in more creative attempts to curb its spread. Communities are largely complying \u2013 in Heilongjiang an official bragged of the 35,000 people who rushed to the testing stations, queueing under umbrellas. But tolerance is beginning to wane, especially when it involves so few cases. In Jiangxi authorities turned all traffic lights red to halt movement after a single case was identified \u2013 its first in almost two years. The move was reversed after public outcry. In Beijing some residents complained of glitchy health apps recording their location in the wrong place, and leaving them stranded. On Monday Beijing\u2019s health commission asked people to avoid leaving or returning if possible. In Ruili, a small town on the border between China\u2019s Yunnan and Myanmar, repeated lockdowns and waves of outbreaks have driven people away. Local media reported that one baby in the city who had been tested 74 times since September. In late October, someone who claimed to be a Ruili student posted on Weibo that he and his family were unable to return home. Local officials told Chinese media that since 2020 the number of residents had reduced from half a million to 200,000. \u201cImpacted by the epidemic for a long time, many people found life hard to cope with,\u201d one said. The mayor has made an extraordinary plea for help from Beijing. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are among the last global jurisdictions still clinging to elimination strategies for the virus. For all three it involves the continuation of strict border closures and quarantine systems. Some have begun to question the sustainability of the strategy, as the rest of the world begins reopening and accepting life with the virus, mitigated by high rates of vaccination and less intrusive health measures. Others note that the strategy has worked \u2013 all three places are largely Covid free, having seen few of the world\u2019s five million recorded deaths. In Shanghai, Qian praised the response at Disneyland. \u201cOne can really believe in Shanghai for ever. The response speed and the measures to deal with the epidemic are really fast and reasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Halloween will be unforgettable, a happy, beautiful, and wonderful journey with no dangers. I hope the epidemic gets better soon and everyone is safe and sound.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/china-locks-down-shanghai-disneyland-and-tests-34000-visitors-after-single-covid-case", "last_update": "2021-11-02T04:23:48Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Verry Elleegant upsets favourite Incentivise to win Melbourne Cup ", "article": "Trainer Chris Waller finally got his hands on the Melbourne Cup after Verry Elleegant, ridden by James McDonald, upset the overwhelming pre-race favourite Incentivise at Flemington racecourse. Incentivise, one of the shortest-priced Cup favourites, had to settle for second place in the $8m race over 3,200m with UK-trained Spanish Mission crossing the line in third. Floating Artist was fourth, The Chosen One fifth and Grand Promenade sixth. After a spectator-free event due to Covid-19 restrictions in Victoria last year, a 10,000-strong fully-vaccinated crowd was allowed back in the stands on Tuesday and they made their voices heard as Verry Elleegant surged down the home straight.\nIn perfect racing conditions under blue skies, the six-year-old mare delivered a first Cup win for Waller after overhauling Incentivise on the long Flemington straight and then leaving the star of this year\u2019s Spring Carnival in her wake. The reigning Australian horse of the year crossed the line three-and-a-half lengths in front to claim her 10th Group 1 win, while victory for Waller added the Cup to his collection of four Cox Plates won with Winx. \u201cI never thought I would ever win one,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI always dreamed of winning one, but it\u2019s so hard to win. A dream come true. When I went for home, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I was thinking, where\u2019s that post? \u201cShe travelled so sweetly in the run for such a big way. She is trained by a master. He gets them right. She is a superstar and I\u2019m so proud of her. \u201cWe\u2019ve been along for the ride for so many seasons now. This has cemented her place right up the top of those real top horses because what she\u2019s done over the years, some seven furlongs to 3,200m. To win one of the biggest races in the land, it is just incredible.\u201d\nMcDonald only found himself partnering the eventual winner after UK horse Away He Goes was scratched less than a week ago and the jockey was booked late to pilot Verry Elleegant, who was entered into the Cup after her Cox Plate placing. Waller, who is based in Sydney, was not trackside to watch his charge\u2019s greatest victory but the stable\u2019s assistant trainer, Johanne Taylor, paid tribute to the absent trainer.\n\u201cThis is unreal,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone in Australian racing dreams of this. It\u2019s such a pity Chris can\u2019t be here. He certainly deserves this more than anyone. Very emotional from the entire team and it means the world to us.\u201d All 23 horses that started the race crossed the finish line. The starting field had been reduced by one after the late scratching of outsider Future Score, who showed signs of lameness on race eve and failed veterinary checks on Tuesday morning. There had also been doubts over the participation of Delphi but the former UK-based horse was passed fit and came home seventh as champion jockey Damian Oliver\u2019s bid for a fourth Cup triumph fell short.

Kami, meaning paper in Japanese, is a digital classroom platform and app, which allows teachers and students to interact with, and collaborate on, documents and learning resources, either within the classroom or remotely. The company is not the only one in the news recently for rewarding its employees \u2013 US shapewear company Spanx last week announced it was giving employees two first-class plane tickets and US$10,000 each to mark its new US$1.2bn valuation. Kami was founded in 2013 by Auckland university students Hengjie Wang, Jordan Thoms, and Alliv Samson, who were looking for a way to digitally streamline their note-taking. The service is now used in more than 180 countries and by more than 30 million teachers and students, with its largest user-base in North America. Now, more than 90% of US schools are using the platform. Last week, the company secured the number one spot in the 2021 Deloitte Fast 50 index, with \u201ca remarkable 1,177% revenue growth over the past three years\u201d, according to Deloitte.\nLast year, Kami offered its software to teachers around the globe free of charge to help them continue to digitally reach students during the worst of the global pandemic. Sales dried up overnight, the company\u2019s chief executive Wang said, but that turned around when teachers asked to start paying, to ensure the platform\u2019s future. \u201cFast forward 18 months, with that sort of massive shift in education, we saw maybe about five years\u2019 worth of growth in the market in one year.\u201d To celebrate both this success and hitting the 30 million user mark, the company decided to reward its employees. \u201cOur team had been working incredibly long hours, made a lot of sacrifices over the last 18 months, supporting teachers and students globally. We wanted a way to say thank you and recognise what they have achieved,\u201d Wang said. Kami announced the bonus in a Zoom call to staff this week, saying they were all \u201cshocked and surprised\u201d.\n\u201cWe live in one of the most diverse cities that you can ever possibly operate in so, you know, I think we ultimately just built a company that reflects the Auckland culture \u2026 we really want to celebrate the best ideas and letting them come to the top, and over time that that has clearly shown in our results.\u201d Wang said he hopes Kami\u2019s success could become an example to other local tech startups. \u201cYou hear all of these big startup funding announcements, and Kami was certainly not one of these. But despite this we have shown the world that achieving this level of growth and the impact that we have is possible.

{"title": "RBA flags earlier interest rates rise as economy bounces back from Covid lockdowns", "article": "The Reserve Bank of Australia has sent its strongest signal yet that the emergency measures it introduced to support the economy during the Covid pandemic will now be wound back, paving the way for an earlier than expected interest rate rise. As expected the central bank left the official cash rate target at the record low 0.1% annual rate set at the November board meeting last year. Analysts\u2019 attention, though, was focused on the shift in the language of its accompanying commentary. Previous months\u2019 statements had identified 2024 as its \u201ccentral scenario\u201d when inflation would be \u201csustainably\u201d within its 2%-3% target range. A recent pickup in core inflation to 2.1% in the September quarter \u2013 entering that target range for the first time in six years \u2013 and other recent signs of a recovery in the economy since the lifting of Delta Covid-19 lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT has given the RBA confidence to bring that date forward to 2023.\nIn order for the actual inflation rate to remain within 2%-3%, the labour market will need to be \u201ctight enough to generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently\u201d, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said, adding \u201cthis is likely to take some time\u201d. \u201cThe board is prepared to be patient, with the central forecast being for underlying inflation to be no higher than 2.5% at the end of 2023 and for only a gradual increase in wages growth,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s central bank declared \u201ca bounce back is now under way\u201d after the Delta outbreak, with companies now hiring and the job rate set to trend lower for the next couple of years. The RBA expects GDP growth of 3% over 2021, and 5.5% and 2.5% over the following two years, it said. \u201cOne important source of uncertainty continues to be the possibility of a further setback on the health front.\u201d The encouraging comments about the economy will likely mean interest rates rise sooner than that 2024 scenario previously stated by the bank. While the cash rate was left unchanged for now, the RBA has surrendered to market forces and ceased trying to keep the yield on the benchmark April 2024 to just 10 basis points, or 0.1%. However, the bank also maintained its bond buying at the $4bn a week pace until at least mid-February 2022. \u201cThe decision to discontinue the yield target reflects the improvement in the economy and the earlier-than-expected progress towards the inflation target,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cGiven that other market interest rates have moved in response to the increased likelihood of higher inflation and lower unemployment, the effectiveness of the yield target in holding down the general structure of interest rates in Australia has diminished.\u201d The Australian dollar dropped below the US75 cent mark, bond yields fell, and the stockmarket rose after the RBA statement. Economists including AMP\u2019s Shane Oliver continue to expect the first rise in official interest rates to come by the end of 2022.\nMaxime Darmet, a director at Fitch Ratings, said \u201cit\u2019s really like the first step we think towards the normalisation of [Australia\u2019s] monetary policy settings, which had been very loose since the pandemic\u201d. However, he said should the recovery remain strong we can expect more adjustments sooner than the 2023 RBA forecast: \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that in the next meeting they would think it would be 2022.\u201d Evidence the RBA can start paring back emergency measures will be noted elsewhere, with the central banks of the US and the UK also holding key meetings this week. The US Federal Open Market Committee begins two days of meetings today and investors are expecting it to announce a reduction \u2013 or tapering \u2013 of its quantitative easing problem on Wednesday. Since March 2020 as the first Covid waves disrupted the world economy, the Fed has been buying up $US120b in bonds and mortgages each month to drive down interest rates and support the economy. On Thursday, the Bank of England announces its policy decision, with investors wary that it will lift interest rates to quell rising inflation in the UK. In Australia\u2019s case, the RBA has already eased its bond-buying binge from $5bn a week to $4bn in its bid to keep commercial banks flush with cheap money that they can lend. Much of the borrowing activity, though, has ended up in residential housing. October house prices were almost 22% higher than a year ago, CoreLogic said on Monday. Separate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, also out yesterday, revealed a small drop in housing lending for owner-occupied housing in September but the tally was 49% higher than pre-Covid levels in February 2020. Fitch\u2019s Darmet said the RBA had been relatively \u201cdovish\u201d in its signalling that it was not worried about inflation. However, it also couldn\u2019t be seen to be too slow in responding as central banks in the US, Canada and soon the UK prepare to wind back support for the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing so much pressure on prices at a global level with energy prices spiking, with supply bottlenecks persisting and so on,\u201d Darmet said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dovish central bank but starting gradually to come around to the new reality that inflation is going to be probably higher than they expected.\u201d While mortgage holders can take some relief from Tuesday\u2019s RBA comments that an interest rate rise isn\u2019t around the corner, Australia and other nations have allowed housing prices to rise too far too fast for the overall health of the economy, not to mention housing affordability for those not in the market. \u201cLow interest rates are the main channel through which people are taking on more debt,\u201d Darmet said. \u201c[It] can become a concern in terms of not only affordability for low income households, but also it creates a lot of potential financial instability and risk. \u201cAnd this is something many central banks are not taking too seriously,\u201d the Fitch analyst said. In an unusual webinar \u2013 used to explain \u201cimportant announcements\u201d \u2013 Lowe said Tuesday\u2019s meeting had not discussed house prices \u201cin any detail\u201d. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t have any concerns about the deterioration in lending standards\u201d for home loans, Lowe said. Instead, the focus was on the decision to end the yield curve target, which had made recent days \u201cturbulent ones in the bond market\u201d, he said. The central bank chief also made it clear the RBA is not about to lift its cash target rate, dismissing market predictions of a rise as soon as next March \u201cas a complete overreaction to the recent inflation data\u201d. A reason for caution is that the Covid pandemic might not have finished in terms of its ability to throw the economy off track. \u201cOne source of such a shock would be a new strain of the virus or a decline in vaccine effectiveness,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIn this case, the cash rate would need to remain at its current level for longer than otherwise.\u201d While there are supply shortages of some goods, those could ease over the coming six months or so as consumers respond to the end of lockdowns by switching some of their spending to services. While many overseas economies faced higher energy prices, Australia\u2019s electricity prices at least are lower than a year ago, Lowe said, as was reported last month.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/rba-flags-earlier-interest-rates-rise-as-economy-bounces-back-from-covid-lockdowns", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:49:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The second series of the stranger-than-fiction documentary is scheduled for release on 17 November.\nAccording to Variety, the lawsuit was filed on Monday, with the couple arguing they only signed appearance release forms for the first series, which Carole Baskin later described as \u201ca reality show dumpster fire\u201d. The lawsuit states: \u201cBy utilizing the film footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode Productions under the Appearance Releases in \u2018sizzle reels\u2019 and promotional trailers for the sequel entitled \u2018Tiger King 2,\u2019 the Defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance Releases.\u201d The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix to ditch all footage of them from Tiger King 2. The lawsuit also claims that the first series was misleading in its depiction of Big Cat Rescue\u2019s operations and unfairly accused the Baskins of animal abuse. Carole Baskin is also claiming the first series perniciously implicated her in the disappearance of her first husband in 1997.\nThe Guardian has sought comment from Netflix in the US. Millions of viewers became enthralled watching Tiger King, with the intense hatred between Joe Exotic, the showman owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, and animal conservationist Carole Baskin central to the real-life drama. In 2018, Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin. The following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to a 22-year prison sentence in Fort Worth, Texas.\nExotic is currently appealing the harshness of the sentence and has sold his zoo. In January this year, an Oklahoma federal judge ordered the new owners of zoo, Jeff and Lauren Lowe, to turn over all the lion and tiger cubs in their possession, along with the animals\u2019 mothers, to the federal government, finding the animal park had violated the US\u2019s Endangered Species Act and the Animal Welfare Act.

The layer upon layer of secrecy in the case has prompted renewed criticism from human rights lawyers, who say the loss of open justice erodes public confidence. Collaery, a lawyer and former Australian Capital Territory attorney general, is facing trial for allegedly disclosing intelligence information about a 2004 mission by Australia to bug its impoverished ally Timor-Leste during oil and gas negotiations. He and his client, the former intelligence officer Witness K, have been described as heroes of Timor-Leste for their actions, including by the former president Jose Ramos-Horta.\nLast month Collaery won a major battle in the ACT court of appeal to remove secrecy orders shrouding significant parts of his prosecution from the public. In a summary of its decision, the court cited the importance of open justice in preventing \u201cpolitical prosecutions\u201d. \u201cThe court emphasised that the open hearing of criminal trials was important because it deterred political prosecutions, allowed the public to scrutinise the actions of prosecutors, and permitted the public to properly assess the conduct of the accused person,\u201d the summary said. Almost four weeks later, the court\u2019s full judgment has still not been published. On Tuesday Australia\u2019s attorney general again intervened in the case, this time asking for significant parts of the judgment to be redacted, on grounds including national security. Arguments for redactions took place briefly in open court. The court was then closed to the public and media to allow the attorney general, represented by Anna Mitchelmore SC, to fully make the case for suppressions. A Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer, Kieran Pender, said the court of appeal had already made clear that secrecy in the Collaery case erodes public confidence. \u201cThe next step in this sorry saga should be to drop the charges altogether, not to argue for more secrecy, at a secret hearing, about a judgment that said no to a secret trial,\u201d he said.

Parliamentarians declared an array of trusts including for investment purposes, self-managed super funds, and family trusts relating to businesses including agricultural concerns. On 8 October, Hughes declared a shareholding in SLN Services Pty Ltd, the trustee of the SLN Services Trust, which she disclosed is \u201ca discretionary trust in which the senator is a potential beneficiary and provides consultancy services, including in relation to charitable organisations\u201d. The declaration includes no further details of entities that pay the trust for services.\nHughes told Guardian Australia that through the trust she and \u201cothers, whoever I want to engage\u201d perform advisory work for the board of PBFH Pty Ltd \u2013 Pacific Biofuels Holdings \u2013 which she said had \u201cset up a charitable arm, a social services arm\u201d to \u201creinvest in local communities\u201d. The trust is paid an undisclosed, fixed annual fee. \u201c[PBFH is] an Australian company setting up in PNG, and they\u2019ve asked me to assist them because I used to run charities in Australia but also know PNG,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a beneficiary of anything \u2013 yet. But we set [SLN Services Trust] up because at some stage I may be a beneficiary of it.\u201d \u201cThe reason I had to set something up is I\u2019m not an employee of theirs [PBFH]\u201d. We\u2019re not trying to hide anything, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem putting PBFH on the register of interests \u2026 We have done this all the right way.\u201d\nHughes said PBFH is the only entity to have paid SLN Services Trust, which has no other potential beneficiaries \u201cat the moment\u201d. Hughes is the sole director and secretary of the trustee company and has a beneficial interest in 100% of its shares. Zach Frederick, PBFH\u2019s social change director, told Guardian Australia it is a \u201cnew, for-profit company that will be using a portion of its profits to effect beneficial social programs in PNG and throughout the South Pacific\u201d. \u201cThese programs include investing in education and local health initiatives.\u201d An engagement letter sent to Hughes in September by the PBFH chief executive, Mary Symons, states that SLN Services will advise on \u201csocial change programs, aimed at improving the lives of the people in the Central Province\u201d. Symons wrote PBFH had selected SLN Services due to \u201cextensive experience in charitable work and your deep understanding of the mechanics of how to best obtain positive outcomes\u201d. Before entering parliament, Hughes was the chair of the Country Autism Network for seven years and a non-executive director of Streetwork, a charity for at-risk youth. PBFH advised it had \u201cno agreements with the Australian commonwealth\u201d, ensuring that Hughes\u2019 work would not disqualify her from sitting in parliament. In June, the Senate clerk, Richard Pye, provided advice to Hughes on the declaration of senators\u2019 interests. Pye noted that senators are required to declare \u201cany other substantial sources of income\u201d using the rule of thumb that income of more than $5,000 a year should be disclosed. \u201cI expect that Senator Hughes would need to make a declaration here,\u201d he said, commenting on an earlier letter of offer before Hughes decided to provide services through a trust. Hughes has not declared any \u201cother\u201d sources of income. A spokesperson for Hughes said the corporate advisory work \u201chas been disclosed as a registrable interest\u201d. The Nationals senator Susan McDonald discloses on her register of interests that she is a discretionary beneficiary of \u201cOHG Trust\u201d, which is described as a \u201cconsultancy\u201d. A spokesperson for McDonald said it was \u201cset up to provide consultancy prior to the senator\u2019s election\u201d but \u201chas been inactive since then with no services being provided by anyone or to anyone\u201d. McDonald has not received a distribution from the trust since becoming a senator, they said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/liberal-senator-hollie-hughes-doing-paid-consulting-work-for-a-for-profit-biofuels-company", "last_update": "2021-11-02T02:48:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "NSW Covid update: freedoms for fully vaccinated residents brought forward", "article": "The New South Wales government has brought forward a raft of freedoms for fully vaccinated residents, while delaying when unvaccinated people can exit stay-at-home orders. From Monday 8 November, fully vaccinated people will be able to have unlimited visitors to their home, density limits on venues will ease and dancing will be allowed at nightclubs. Under the original roadmap, restrictions were supposed to ease from 1 December. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the changes were due to the state\u2019s high vaccination rate, with authorities pushing NSW to hit 95% double dose coverage. \u201cWe said from the outset that this was the key for our state to be able to open up safely,\u201d Perrottet said. \u201cEverybody has done an incredible job to ensure NSW can ease restrictions in a safe and considered way earlier than we planned. [This] is one last push and I believe that we can get to that 95% mark.\u201d The changes also delay when restrictions ease for unvaccinated people \u2013 either when the state hits that 95% fully vaccinated rate or by 15 December, whichever occurs first.\nThis means unvaccinated residents will continue to be barred from businesses, gyms and venues for at least two weeks more than expected. Perrottet said the delay was to ensure the state could continue reopening \u201csafely\u201d and hoped it would incentivise people to get the jab. \u201cUltimately we want a united society and we believe by moving that date back to December 15 will incentivise\u201d he said. Caps on gym and dance classes remain, but entertainment venues with fixed seating will open to 100% capacity. Indoor swimming pools will also be able to reopen. The mask mandate will also remain until the state hits 95% fully vaccinated, or 15 December. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, welcomed rising vaccination rates and the changes, calling them a \u201cgiant step\u201d for the state. \u201cA year and a half ago we all wondered whether we would get vaccinated or whether we would ever get our freedoms back,\u201d he said. \u201cA little as three or four months ago, when things were looking dark, we were all wondering if we\u2019ll be able to get through the next few months. \u201cThis really is a giant step for all of us, and how good is it that we have actually faced down this enemy of this hidden virus and managed to get our freedoms back.\u201d Hazzard said while vaccination rates in western Sydney were \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d, there were still some concerns for the Hunter region. \u201cThe message is: the virus is still out there,\u201d he said. In NSW 93.6% of people eligible have now had at least one dose of the vaccine, while 87.8% are fully vaccinated. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, urged young people to take up the vaccine or to book their second dose.

They also have more social contacts. So it is critical we achieve high rates of coverage in those groups.\u201d The changes were announced as the state recorded 173 new locally acquired cases, and four deaths: two men in their 50s, one man in his 60s and one man in his 70s.

Since she was placed on hold for most of the day while trying to change an airline ticket with Qantas during lockdown in August, the Sydney publicist and talent manager has been campaigning for Australian companies to ditch their royalty-free elevator music and turn to local content on their call-waiting systems. Initially, Eck targeted Centrelink, Service NSW and Services Australia as well Qantas\u2019s CEO Alan Joyce. She also lobbied the federal arts minister Paul Fletcher and New South Wales customer service minister Victor Dominello.\nA petition launched on Change.org \u2013 Hold Aussie Music \u2013 has so far attracted almost 10,000 signatures, and the Australian Recording Industry Association (Aria) and the music copyright organisation Apra Amcos have both thrown their support behind the campaign. Now Eck has ramped up the volume, with a plan to target 30 brands in 30 days over the month of November. \u201cThe Australian music industry has been on its knees during the pandemic, so why shouldn\u2019t big corporations give our local musicians a platform to showcase their work?\u201d Eck told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s just about choosing a playlist that supports our incredible talent in Australia.\u201d The companies selected for targeting will be at the suggestion of the campaign\u2019s supporters, with NRMA, Apple, Telstra, Optus, Sydney airport and the Australian Taxation Office in its sights. Large businesses that already play commercial music but are being asked to switch to more Australian content include Medicare, Energy Australia, Centrelink, MyGov and three of the four big banks.\nOn Tuesday, tagging #HoldAussieMusic, ME Bank in Melbourne announced it would update its playlist for call holding with 10 new homegrown tunes, including those from Jack River, Tones and I, Budjerah, Birdz and Gang of Youths. Eck said she believes many companies are simply unaware of what their customers experience when they are placed on hold. \u201cThe people in positions of power, the decision-makers, they are never put on hold with their own business, so they often just don\u2019t think very much about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an awareness that needs to be encouraged from a management brand perspective. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\n\u201cAnd there are companies that can curate playlists for individual businesses, who can make sure that the music is appropriate for the brand, that it has the right tempo, the right tone. \u201cA businesses can really use their music on their call-holding system as a platform to reflect their own brand.\u201d Supermarket wars On Monday, Woolworths announced a new partnership with Australian Radio Network, owners of the KIIS Network, The Edge and iHeartRadio brands. The deal includes an undertaking to play more Australian artists in Woolworths\u2019 995 stores across the country (subject to the tastes of each store\u2019s demographic) and on the supermarket\u2019s digital radio via the iHeartRadio app. \u201cIt will be shopping trolleys at 50 paces as Australia\u2019s two supermarket giants go head-to-head with in-store entertainment,\u201d Radio Today declared, referring to a longstanding partnership between Woolworth\u2019s only competitor, Coles, and Nova Entertainment.\nIn 2019, the Coles/Nova partnership saw Coles Radio topping the digital-only radio ratings, with 254,000 listeners across the country each week (ABC\u2019s Double J was second, with 221,000 listeners). Hold Aussie Music is just one of several campaigns since the start of the pandemic to push for more Australian music in the corporate sector. In August, singer-songwriter Holly Rankin, who performs as Jack River, called out on social media Channel Seven\u2019s failure to play sufficient Australian music during its Tokyo Olympics coverage. She also challenged Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and banks to use more local music in-store and in their ads. Coles responded by announcing it would turn up the volume on its commitment to local music. In October, the Aria-led Our Soundtrack Our Stories campaign succeeded in getting the Commonwealth Bank, Nissan Australia, Bonds, Channel Seven, Qsic, 7Eleven, Channel 10, Rebel Sport and Bank Australia to publicly commit to increase their support for homegrown music.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/02/give-local-musicians-a-platform-australian-businesses-urged-to-shake-up-on-hold-playlists", "last_update": "2021-11-02T01:24:50Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Robert Durst indicted for murder 39 years after wife Kathie Durst disappeared", "article": "Robert Durst was indicted on Monday for murder in the death of his first wife, Kathie McCormack Durst, who disappeared nearly four decades ago. The multimillionaire real estate heir is currently serving a life sentence in California for the murder of Susan Berman, his friend and confidante who prosecutors say helped him cover up Kathie Durst\u2019s killing. Durst was hospitalized on a ventilator with Covid-19 after his 14 October sentencing in the Los Angeles case and was transferred last week to a state prison hospital. His current medical condition was not released. A grand jury in the New York City suburbs returned the second-degree murder indictment on Monday. \u201cWhen Kathleen Durst disappeared on January 31, 1982, her family and friends were left with pain, anguish and questions that have contributed to their unfaltering pursuit of justice for the last 39 years,\u201d the Westchester district attorney, Mimi Rocah, said in a statement announcing the indictment. Rocah said her office had \u201creinvigorated its investigation\u201d into Robert Durst when she took office in January, launching a cold case unit and dedicating necessary skill and resources. She decided to take the case to a grand jury in early October. Rocah said Durst\u2019s indictment was a \u201chuge step forward in the pursuit of justice for Kathie Durst, her family and victims of domestic violence everywhere\u201d. Asked by a reporter if he had any reaction to the indictment, Durst\u2019s lawyer Chip Lewis replied in an email: \u201cFake news!\u201d Asked in a subsequent email if he would be representing Durst in the New York case and whether there were health concerns about moving him to New York, Lewis responded: \u201cNot sure he will make it. But if he does, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d A lawyer for Kathie Durst\u2019s family said they were still processing the news of the indictment and would speak more about the matter in the coming days. Kathie Durst\u2019s 1982 disappearance garnered renewed public interest after HBO aired a documentary in 2015 in which Durst appeared to admit killing people, stepping off camera and muttering to himself on a live microphone: \u201cKilled them all, of course.\u201d Kathie Durst was 29 and in her final months of medical school when she was last seen. She and Robert Durst, who was 38 at the time, had been married nearly nine years and were living in South Salem, a community in Lewisboro, New York. Her body was never found. Robert Durst divorced her in 1990, citing abandonment. At the request of her family, she was declared legally dead in 2017. Robert Durst had never previously been charged in her disappearance. In December 2000, Durst shot and killed Berman as she was preparing to tell police about her involvement in Kathie Durst\u2019s death, prosecutors said. She had told friends she provided a phony alibi for him after his wife vanished, according to prosecutors. Durst was convicted in September of killing Berman. Afterward, the Los Angeles prosecutor John Lewin described him as a \u201cnarcissistic psychopath\u201d, saying Durst had \u201ckilled his wife and then he had to keep killing to cover it up\u201d. Durst, testifying in the Los Angeles trial in August, denied killing Kathie Durst. After her medical school called to report that she hadn\u2019t been going to class, he said he figured she was \u201cout someplace having fun\u201d and suggested that perhaps drug use was to blame. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t occurred to me that anything had happened to her,\u201d Durst said, speaking slowly in a strained, raspy voice. \u201cIt was more like: what had Kathie done to Kathie?\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/robert-durst-indicted-murder-accusation-kathie-durst", "last_update": "2021-11-02T12:44:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "NSW forced to correct thousands of debt recovery letters for hotel quarantine", "article": "The New South Wales government will be forced to correct and resend 44,000 letters to returning travellers demanding payment for hotel quarantine, due to a basic error explaining its legislative power to recover debts. The state government has issued more than 134,800 invoices charging inbound travellers thousands of dollars for hotel quarantine since the pandemic began. Where the invoices are not paid, Revenue NSW issues debt recovery orders demanding payment, and warning recipients it has the power to take money from wages or a bank, seize property, or issue a charge on land.\nBut the debt recovery order letters contain a small, but potentially, consequential error. In referencing its power to recover debts, the state government names a nonexistent piece of legislation, saying its powers are contained in the State Debt Recovery Act 2013. The correct law is the State Debt Recovery Act 2018. When the Guardian approached Revenue NSW, it said it was \u201cnow aware of the incorrect reference\u201d. It said more than 44,300 debt recovery orders had been issued with the incorrect reference. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Revenue NSW will issue amended Debt Recovery Orders to all affected individuals, however this will not alter the requirement that each invoice be paid,\u201d a spokesperson said. One recipient, who asked not to be identified, told the Guardian they had legal advice suggesting that basing a debt recovery order on a nonexistent law makes it unenforceable. \u201cI have brought this to the attention of NSW Revenue on five separate occasions [emails can be provided] and they have simply ignored it and continued to send debt recovery orders,\u201d he said.

Unvaccinated Australians will continue to need to quarantine and comply with a cap on arrivals. The state is also trialling a home quarantine program to allow returning travellers to avoid hotels and the associated costs. The pilot may become permanent.

{"title": "Facebook failing to protect users from Covid misinformation, says monitor", "article": "Misinformation and sceptical views about Covid-19 and vaccines has been allowed to spread on more than a dozen Facebook and Instagram accounts, pages and groups that together have gained 370,000 followers over the past year, according to a report. The misinformation and promotion of vaccine hesitancy includes posts in Facebook groups claiming that children are being \u201cmurdered by the experimental jab they\u2019re being pressured to take\u201d, and an Instagram account promoting a documentary by Andrew Wakefield, one of the key figures in promoting discredited links between MMR inoculation and autism. The 20 accounts, pages and groups have been tracked by NewsGuard, an organisation that monitors online misinformation. Since September last year NewsGuard has submitted regular reports to the World Health Organization, at the WHO\u2019s request, flagging social media sites and other digital platforms that are spreading falsehoods about Covid-19. In research published on Tuesday, NewsGuard said 20 of the sites that it had monitored over that period had gained a total of 372,670 followers. A full report containing the research has been sent to the WHO. The NewsGuard research points to prominent sources of vaccine scepticism such as the Facebook pages of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a prominent anti-vaxxer, and Joseph Mercola, an alternative medicine doctor, as well as smaller sources such as the France Soir account on Instagram. Kennedy was banned from Instagram over his vaccine stance in February but his Facebook page and Mercola\u2019s Instagram account have gained more than 140,000 followers since February, according to NewsGuard. Mercola has said he has \u201cevery right to inform the public by sharing my medical research\u201d. Facebook came under pressure to ban Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy, in March when he released a documentary, Medical Racism, which has been accused of seeking to promote vaccine hesitancy among black Americans. Kennedy has said the film \u201cempowers all Americans to demand the safest vaccines\u201d. Facebook and Instagram are both owned by Meta, the company that until a rebranding last week was known as Facebook. Alex Cardier, the UK managing director for NewsGuard, said Facebook and Instagram were failing to protect their users from Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation despite having been warned \u201crepeatedly\u201d. He said: \u201cThe company\u2019s engagement-at-all-costs mantra means that viral and divisive sources of misinformation continue to flourish, despite warnings from NewsGuard and the clear danger posed to users. Facebook gave itself a new name but their promotion of misinformation remains the same.\u201d A Meta spokesperson said the company was encouraging users of its platforms to get vaccinated and it was taking action against misinformation. \u201cDuring the pandemic we have removed more than 20m pieces of harmful misinformation and we\u2019ve taken down content identified in this report which violates our rules. In total we\u2019ve now banned more than 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for repeatedly breaking our rules. We\u2019re also labelling all posts about the vaccines with accurate information and worked with independent factcheckers to mark 190m posts as false.\u201d In an effort to reassure users on the efficacy of vaccines, several of the Facebook pages highlighted by NewsGuard contained Facebook labels directing users to a WHO page on vaccines or the company\u2019s own Covid-19 information centre page.

{"title": "Australia could become a net negative emissions economy. The technology already exists | Frank Jotzo", "article": "Australia finally has a net zero target. Even without being legislated, it matters as a signal. It will effectively be bipartisan, a rare and valuable thing in Australia\u2019s climate policy. Of course the long-term goal could be used to deflect from the fact that not much is being done to put Australia on a low-carbon pathway right now, but it must be taken at face value if we are to stand a chance. How can Australia become net zero? Technically the answer is quite clear, and has been for a long time. What has changed is that more and more zero emissions options are available at lower and lower cost. The task is now easier than we thought it would be just five years ago.\nIt starts with a complete shift to clean energy in electricity supply. In Australia, the cost-effective power system of the future is a mix of solar and wind power, with energy storage in batteries and pumped-hydro plants, and gas plants at the ready for occasional use when needed. It means huge investments that will give us zero emissions power at low operating costs. The task this decade is to mobilise those investments for the clean energy future. Record amounts of solar and wind are being installed in Australia, now driven largely by commercial decisions. The process needs to be sped up. We need reform in the electricity market, including the planned and accelerated decommissioning of remaining coal plants, and the rapid building of new transmission lines. Coal has no role in our future electricity system, as new plants with carbon capture and storage would be far more expensive and still have some remaining carbon emissions. It is possible that other technologies will play a role but right now nothing else matches renewables for affordability. Nuclear has a role in countries where renewable power is more limited. For it to be viable economically in Australia, it would need a dramatic drop in cost which is not in sight. The grid of the future will be far more decentralised, relying more on local power sources, especially solar panels and small-scale storage. That includes electric cars: collectively the car-owning public will build up a massive battery capacity on wheels which can bolster the system through vehicle-to-grid charging. Zero emissions electricity supply will power most of the things that now use oil, gas or coal. \u201cElectrify everything\u201d is the battle cry. In transport that includes electric cars and trucks, and heavy transport using clean hydrogen made using renewable power. In industry it means shifting to electricity as a heat source, and using clean hydrogen as energy feedstock. In buildings it means electric heat pumps and induction cooktops. Out with the gas. Much of this will need policy support of one kind or another. A price on carbon emissions is an essential part of the policy mix, starting in industry. These are new battle lines for the energy industry. Governments and industry are pushing hard for a continued role for gas, and possibly coal, as the feedstock for hydrogen production. That is now cheaper than making hydrogen from renewable electricity through electrolysis, but it has remaining emissions even if carbon capture and storage is used, and the electric route is quickly becoming cheaper. The same goes for the possible clean energy export industries of the future \u2013 hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic fuels \u2013 even processing iron ore into iron and steel \u2013 can all run on the back of renewable power.\nCarbon capture and storage will likely have a niche role in specific cases where there are no alternatives or where it is cheapest. Cement production is an example. In some cases, the captured carbon could be used as a material. Then there is agriculture, which now accounts for about 14% of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. That\u2019s a matter of improvements in agricultural practices, and shifting the product mix away from cattle and sheep, which are heavy emitters of methane which is driving global warming in the short term. So where in all this is the need for new technologies, which the government\u2019s net zero \u201cplan\u201d portrays as the only thing that matters? Innovation will make known clean technologies cheaper and better, and in a few specific areas new technologies are needed. But the overwhelming part of the journey can and will be done using technologies that are in use now. It is a matter of deploying existing technologies at scale, rapidly. We should plan ahead with some future technologies but we do not need to wait for technology. Some greenhouse gas emissions will remain. And that is fine, they will be compensated for by drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That is why it is called net zero. Photosynthesis is an excellent way to take carbon dioxide from the air, for example through revegetation of marginal grazing lands, also through better management of agricultural soils. But any area of land eventually reaches its carbon saturation point so this is not a forever option. That is where carbon dioxide removal through technological means comes in. It includes carbon dioxide capture directly from the air, and some other technologies such as enhanced weathering for specific minerals. These options are costly and energy-intensive. But their cost will come down with research and experience, and they would be powered by renewable energy. This continent has the preconditions to do carbon dioxide removal at large scale. Australia could become a net negative emissions economy. That would mean becoming an exporter of emissions removal services, alongside energy and energy-intensive products made using renewable energy. The government\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d assumes purchasing offset credits from other countries. This is curious given Australia\u2019s relative advantage in land availability and renewable energy. It also misses one of the key areas where future R&D is needed and could directly result in positioning Australia better for a net zero world economy.\nRight now we cannot assess the basis for the offset assumption. That is because the government is withholding the technical/modelling report that informed the net zero decision. It suits politicians to release high-level documents prepared with help from consultancy firms before the analysis that is prepared by government departments. But it amounts to a failure of proper process in an open democracy. It enables obfuscation and monopolises information. To understand Australia\u2019s opportunities and pressure points in the transition to net zero we need an open, inclusive, genuine process. One that allows building truly shared understanding, and that keeps the politics at arms length from the deliberations about long-term national strategy. Putting in place a genuine process for a long-term emissions strategy is a chance for the next federal government, whichever party wins. \u2022 Frank Jotzo is a professor at the Australian National University and head of energy at its Institute for Climate Energy & Disaster Solutions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/australia-could-become-a-net-negative-emissions-economy-the-technology-already-exists", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:59:51Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Thousands of adverse birth outcomes in England down to \u2018alarming\u2019 inequality", "article": "Thousands of babies in England are being born prematurely, smaller than expected or stillborn because of \u201calarming\u201d and \u201cdevastating\u201d socioeconomic and racial inequalities across the country, a landmark study has suggested. Both are known risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes. However, until now, little has been known about the scale of their \u201cheartbreaking\u201d impact on women and babies. Now research involving more than 1m births suggests socioeconomic inequalities account for a quarter of all stillbirths, a fifth of preterm births, and a third of cases of foetal growth restriction (FGR), a condition in which babies are smaller than expected for their gestational age. At the same time, one in 10 stillbirths and almost one in five FGR cases are due to racial inequalities, the study suggests. The findings, which have prompted calls for urgent action, were published in the medical journal the Lancet. Dr Jennifer Jardine of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (RCOG), one of the study\u2019s co-lead authors, said: \u201cI think that people will be shocked. The stark reality is that across England, women\u2019s socioeconomic and ethnic background are still strongly related to their likelihood of experiencing serious adverse outcomes for their baby.\u201d The review, which was conducted by a team from the National Maternity and Perinatal Audit, analysed 1,155,981 birth records between April 2015 and March 2017 in NHS hospitals in England. The analysis estimates that 24% of stillbirths, 19% of preterm births, and 31% of FGR cases were attributed to socioeconomic inequality and would not have occurred if all women had the same risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as women in the least-deprived group. Adjusting for ethnicity, maternal smoking and body mass index (BMI) substantially reduced these inequalities. That suggests that these characteristics can explain a considerable part of the socioeconomic inequalities in pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy complications disproportionately affected Black and minority-ethnic women: 12% of all stillbirths, 1% of preterm births, and 17% of FGR cases were attributed to ethnic inequality. Prof Jan van der Meulen of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, another co-lead author, told the Guardian the disparities were unacceptable but said there were no quick fixes that could immediately solve the problem. The NHS has set a target of halving stillbirth and neonatal death rates and reducing levels of preterm birth by 25% by 2025. However, the study findings suggest that current national programmes to make pregnancy safer, which focus on an individual woman\u2019s risk and behaviour and their antenatal care, will not be enough to improve outcomes for babies born in England. To reduce disparities in birth outcomes at a national level, Van der Meulen said, politicians, public health professionals and healthcare providers must work together to tackle racism and discrimination and improve women\u2019s social circumstances, social support and health throughout their lives. \u201cNational targets to make pregnancy safer will only be achieved if there is a concerted effort by midwives, obstetricians, public health professionals and politicians to tackle the broader socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities,\u201d he said.\nThe largest increases in excess risk of complications among the most socioeconomically disadvantaged Black and south Asian and women. Half of stillbirths (53.5%) and seven in 10 FGR cases (71.7%) among south Asian women living in the most deprived fifth of neighbourhoods in England could be avoidable if they had the same risks as white women in the most affluent fifth, the study suggests. This was similarly the case for nearly two-thirds of stillbirths (63.7%) and half of FGR cases (55%) among Black women from the most deprived neighbourhoods.\n\u201cThere are many possible reasons for these disparities,\u201d said Van der Meulen. \u201cWomen from deprived neighbourhoods and Black and minority ethnic groups may be at a disadvantage because of their environment, for example, because of pollution, poor housing, social isolation, limited access to maternity and health care, insecure employment, poor working conditions, and stressful life events.\u201d Dr Edward Morris, the president of the RCOG, said the findings of the study were alarming, adding: \u201cThey provide more evidence that poverty, racism and discrimination can affect women throughout their lives and ultimately lead to devastating incidences of pregnancy complications and baby loss.\u201d Dr Christine Ekechi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and co-chair of RCOG\u2019s race equality taskforce, said the disparities were heartbreaking. \u201cThese women are being let down by a healthcare system that is supposed to protect them. Reducing the occurrence of potentially avoidable adverse pregnancy outcomes needs to be a national priority,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/01/thousands-of-adverse-birth-outcomes-in-england-down-to-alarming-inequality", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:06:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Why is Emmanuel Macron so upset with Scott Morrison? ", "article": "The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has accused Scott Morrison of lying over the submarines deal, prompting the Australian prime minister to launch a furious rebuttal of what he called \u201cslurs\u201d and \u201csledging\u201d. Let\u2019s take a look beneath the soundbites to try to find out what on earth has happened. Why is Macron so upset? First, the basics. The French contract with Australia to provide 12 conventionally powered submarines has been a big deal for France \u2013 financially and strategically \u2013 since it was initiated in 2016. The total value of the submarine project was estimated at almost $A90bn (although that figure includes all spending associated with it).\nSo it is only natural that a French president would be upset when Australia revealed it had decided to scrap the contract and would instead partner with the US and the UK to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines (pending an 18-month study). That\u2019s a big loss, but is there another reason France reacted so strongly? Yes. The French government has taken exception to the manner in which the Aukus partnership was negotiated in secret, claiming it was \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d in the process and disrespected as a close partner. It has argued it was told only at the 11th hour with no genuine opportunity for consultation. One of the encounters of most contention is Morrison\u2019s meeting and dinner with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in June. What do we know about Morrison and Macron\u2019s talks in Paris? Morrison went to Paris just days after Morrison had his own trilateral meeting with Joe Biden and Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Carbis Bay in the UK. (We now know the leaders of Australia, the US and the UK were talking about what would later become the Aukus arrangement.) We know that Australia\u2019s concerns about the submarine programme were discussed between Morrison and Macron. Both sides also agree that Morrison raised concern over the deteriorating strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific region. But the two sides have different interpretations of what flowed from that. The French ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, has previously told Guardian Australia that this wasn\u2019t meant to be the end of the conversation: \u201cThe prime minister, to our understanding, signalled that there were questions raised about the evolving situation in the region \u2026 but what was agreed is that this conversation would continue.\u201d Here\u2019s the account provided by Morrison when speaking to reporters in Glasgow on Monday: \u201cNow, at that point, I made it very clear that a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia\u2019s strategic requirements. We discussed that candidly.\u201d But Morrison told reporters it was not up to him to flag the emerging plan B (the US- and UK-backed nuclear-propelled submarines) at that stage: \u201cI did not discuss what other alternatives we were looking at. They were in confidence, and they were subject to the security arrangements we had about those other discussions.\u201d\nDid Morrison give any hint of abandoning the French deal in June? With the benefit of hindsight, maybe a little hint. Speaking to reporters shortly after the meeting in Paris in June, Morrison did not rule out walking away from the project when the next contractual milestone was reached, but he also appeared to imply the sticking points were being resolved. Morrison said he appreciated the French president was \u201ctaking a very active role\u201d in resolving issues with the contract. \u201cPresident Macron and I have a very, very open and very transparent, and very friendly relationship where we can speak candidly to each other about these issues,\u201d Morrison said on 16 June.\nAsked whether he was leaving Paris more or less confident about the submarine program, Morrison said: \u201cI leave knowing that we have properly raised the challenges that we need to address, and so it is now for us to work forward on that basis.\u201d What was going on behind the scenes? Morrison told reporters on Monday that the French defence system \u201cflew into action\u201d the day after the dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e to seek to address issues with the project \u2013 including sending a French admiral to Australia \u201cto try and save the contract\u201d. \u201cSo if there was no concern about the contract being under threat, Admiral Morio would never have come to Australia,\u201d Morrison said. Morrison said the Australian government \u201ceventually formed the view that we would agree to disagree\u201d and that the French Attack class submarine \u201cwould not meet our requirements\u201d.\nHas France raised any other complaints about the Australia\u2019s openness? Yes. At the end of August, just two weeks before the Aukus announcement, Australian ministers Marise Payne and Peter Dutton met by video link with their French counterparts to herald ever-strengthening ties (it was the first ever \u201c2+2\u201d meeting between the two sides). According to the official joint statement \u2013 which were obviously agreed by France and Australia - the four ministers \u201cunderlined the importance of the future submarine program\u201d. Thebault, the French ambassador, has said it\u2019s now apparent there was \u201cno sincerity in the discussion\u201d. What about the letter Australia sent hours before Aukus was announced? France complained that one of the reasons it felt blindsided was because hours earlier Australian officials had informed the French contractor of progress on the submarine contract. In the letter, sent on 15 September, the director general of the future submarine program confirmed the exit of a review of one aspect of the project \u201chas been achieved as required under the Submarine Design Contract\u201d. But the letter also included a caveat that the \u201cmatters addressed in this correspondence do not provide any authorisation to continue work\u201d. At Senate estimates last week, the secretary of Australia\u2019s defence department, Greg Moriarty, said there had been \u201ca number of engagements with French officials about our thinking about capability requirements\u201d but added: \u201cI did not discuss cancellation of the Attack programme with any French official prior to the night before [the announcement].\u201d Moriarty described the reaction of Naval Group when briefed hours later as follows: \u201cThey were surprised and disappointed \u2013 understandably.\u201d How did a text message from Macron to Morrison get leaked? And what did it show? Hours before Morrison\u2019s press conference hitting back at Macron on Monday, Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported on the contents of a text message the prime minister received from the French president two days before the Aukus announcement. By this account, Macron messaged Morrison to say he was not available at the time Australia had requested a call and wrote\u201d: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d\nWhen asked on Monday why a decision was made to release the text message, Morrison said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to indulge your editorial on it.\u201d But Morrison added that the message \u201cmade it pretty clear that [Macron] was concerned\u201d that the contract was to be cancelled. The release of the message appears to be designed to show the Aukus decision didn\u2019t come out of the blue. But another reading of it is that Macron didn\u2019t know \u2013 two days before \u2013 which way the Australian government was leaning. Morrison replied to Macron that it was important that the pair spoke. When a time couldn\u2019t be locked in, Morrison said he texted a letter outlining the decision to Macron. What is being done to undo the damage? France is calling on the Australian government to propose \u201ctangible actions\u201d to heal the diplomatic rift. On Monday the Australian foreign minister met for more than an hour with the French ambassador to start the process \u2013 but that effort may be undercut by some senior members of the government who have played down the significance of Australia\u2019s decision in theatrical terms, and now by Morrison\u2019s strong pushback at Macron\u2019s remarks.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/why-is-emmanuel-macron-so-upset-with-scott-morrison", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:42:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Mark Zuckerberg should quit Facebook, says Frances Haugen", "article": "Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has delivered her strongest call yet for Mark Zuckerberg to step down as chief executive of his social media empire, saying the business will be better off with a leader who focuses on user safety. Frances Haugen said Facebook\u2019s parent company, rebranded Meta last week, is unlikely to change if its founder remains in charge. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, the former Facebook employee, who has leaked tens of thousands of internal documents detailing the company\u2019s struggles with user safety and misinformation, also criticised Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cunconscionable\u201d decision to invest in its metaverse concept instead of focusing on fixing its current problems. Asked if Zuckerberg should step down, Haugen said: \u201cI think Facebook will be stronger with someone who is willing to focus on safety, so yes.\u201d However, Haugen acknowledged that Zuckerberg\u2019s control of Meta was an issue for any independent shareholders who might wish for a change at the top. Zuckerberg controls decision-making at the company through his majority ownership of the voting shares in Meta, which makes his position unassailable. \u201cMark holds 54% of the voting shares in Facebook. He is the chairman and the CEO and I think that at a minimum the shareholders have the right to actually choose their CEO. And so I think it is unlikely the company will change if he remains the CEO,\u201d said Haugen. \u201cAnd I hope that he can see that there is so much good he could do in the world, and maybe it\u2019s a chance for someone else to maybe take the reins.\u201d Haugen also criticised the strategic shift behind the company\u2019s surprise rebranding last week, with Zuckerberg committing the business to a major investment in the metaverse, a space where digital representations of people \u2013 avatars \u2013 interact at work and play, meeting in their office, going to concerts and even trying on clothes.\nHaugen said the documents she had released to Congress, regulators and the press made clear that the company needed to spend more on basic safety systems and not an expansion into virtual reality. The documents released by Haugen have revealed that Meta was aware its Instagram photo-sharing app has been accused of exacerbating mental health problems for teenage girls, that its own workers were dismayed by a failure to stem misinformation spreading in the run-up to the 6 January riot in Washington, and that Facebook was helping to fan ethnic violence in Ethiopia. \u201cI think there is a meta problem at Facebook which is that over and over again Facebook chooses expansion in new areas over sticking the landing on what they have already done and I find it unconscionable that, as you read through the documents, it states very clearly there needs to be more resources on very basic safety systems,\u201d she said. Haugen added that her actions were driven by a belief that Facebook needed to change in order to save lives. \u201cI genuinely believe that there are a million, or maybe 10 million lives on the line in the next 20 years, and compared to that nothing really feels like a real consequence.\u201d Haugen\u2019s appearance at the Web Summit follows her testimonies at the US Congress and in Westminster last month. In London she told MPs and peers that urgent external regulation was needed to rein in the tech company\u2019s management. Haugen was speaking at a joint committee scrutinising the draft online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on social media companies to protect users from harmful content. Meta\u2019s apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, are used daily by 2.8 billion people. Responding to Haugen\u2019s comments, a Meta spokesperson said: \u201cThe argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical. We are on track to spend more than $5bn on safety and security in 2021 \u2013 more than any other tech company \u2013 and have 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps.\u201d The spokeperson added that Meta was able to invest in expansion and safety at the same time. \u201cObviously, we can and must do both of these things at the same time \u2013 and we are.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/01/mark-zuckerberg-should-quit-facebook-says-frances-haugen", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:42:25Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Indigenous peoples to get $1.7bn in recognition of role in protecting forests", "article": "At least $1.7bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet\u2019s lands and forests, it will be announced at Cop26 today. The governments of the UK, US, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands are leading the $1.7bn (\u00a31.25bn) funding pledge, which is being announced as part of ambitious global efforts to reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, with campaigners cautiously hopeful that this conference of the parties (Cop) could be the first to properly champion indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said: \u201cWe are happy with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to transform a system that has directed less than 1% of climate funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what happens next. \u201cThis Cop is interesting and unprecedented,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter attending these climate events for years, this one is different. The UK has put tremendous effort into raising our visibility at this Cop. \u201cBut the UK is now at a crossroads: they can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local communities.\u201d\nAs indigenous peoples have fought for their rights more publicly in recent years, they have faced increasing persecution. In 2020, a record number of people were killed for protecting their land, with more than a third from indigenous communities. Despite the important role they play in protecting forests, only a small fraction of these communities have secure rights to their land. The funding is recognition that IPLCs are crucial to protecting tropical forests and preserving ecosystems. Leaders will be calling on other countries to respect and protect these rights in accordance with national legislation. While the majority of the money in the fund will come from governments, charitable foundations including the Ford Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Arcadia, Wyss Foundation and the Rainforest Trust are contributing more than $600m. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, said the aim was to give IPLCs more of a voice in policymaking and discourse. It is hoped more funding will follow. Walker said: \u201cIt\u2019s a first step, it\u2019s a down payment. We ignore these communities at our peril. We have to invest more, we have to support them more. \u201cI\u2019m not asserting that this is the only solution,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s a critical part of the puzzle of solving climate change and this part of the puzzle needs to be resourced properly.\u201d The money will support IPLCs\u2019 capacity to govern themselves collectively, assist with mapping and registration work, back national land reform and help resolve conflict over territories. It will continue until 2025. Walker said: \u201cWe have been wedded to technical, market-based solutions, and have ignored the communities right in front of us who are key to solving the challenge. \u201cThis is an historic moment. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the paradigm and to at last give power and a seat at the table to the people who are critical to the solution. A new paradigm is emerging and we will hear it loud and clear in Glasgow.\u201d The announcement follows a number of studies that show securing indigenous rights and land tenure is an effective way of protecting the environment. A 2021 UN review of more than 300 studies found that deforestation rates in South America were up to 50% lower within areas under indigenous control than elsewhere. It follows an emphasis on including indigenous voices at the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference in Marseille in September. For the first time in its seven-decade history, the IUCN included indigenous peoples as full voting members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category.\nPaul Redman, founder of If Not Us Then Who?, a US charity that highlights the role indigenous and local peoples play in environmentalism, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time in all the climate conferences I\u2019ve been to since 2013 that leaders really seem to be genuinely engaged and wanting indigenous peoples to be at the table. \u201cThe real key is follow-up: money going to indigenous communities and land titles being allocated to indigenous peoples post-Cop.\u201d\n", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-indigenous-peoples-to-get-17bn-in-recognition-of-role-in-protecting-forests-aoe", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:52:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Biden, Bolsonaro and Xi among leaders agreeing to end deforestation", "article": "World leaders have agreed a deal that aims to halt and reverse global deforestation over the next decade as part of a multibillion-dollar package to tackle human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Xi Jinping, Jair Bolsonaro and Joe Biden are among the leaders who will commit to the declaration at Cop26 in Glasgow on Tuesday to protect vast areas, ranging from the eastern Siberian taiga to the Congo basin, home to the world\u2019s second largest rainforest. Land-clearing by humans accounts for almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, largely deriving from the destruction of the world\u2019s forests for agricultural products such as palm oil, soy and beef. By signing the Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forest and Land Use, presidents and prime ministers from major producers and consumers of deforestation-linked products will commit to protect forest ecosystems.\nBoris Johnson will unveil the agreement at an event attended by the US president, Joe Biden, the Prince of Wales and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo. He is expected to say: \u201cThese great teeming ecosystems \u2013 these cathedrals of nature \u2013 are the lungs of our planet. Forests support communities, livelihoods and food supply, and absorb the carbon we pump into the atmosphere. They are essential to our very survival.\u201d The commitment on nature and forests comes as more than 120 world leaders came together in Glasgow to thrash out fresh commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that key countries have failed to step up. On a day devoted to speeches by presidents and prime ministers that underlined the scale of the challenges ahead, Johnson said future generations \u201cwill judge us with bitterness\u201d if the conference fails. Other key moments included:\n\u2022 India pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Although it is the first time the world\u2019s third biggest polluter has set this target, and experts said it was a realistic commitment, it is 20 years behind the 2050 date set agreed by other developed countries. \u2022 President Biden warned that greater urgency was needed at the talks: \u201cRight now, we are falling short. There\u2019s no time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves.\u201d \u2022 Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said the world was being driven to the brink by an addiction to fossil fuels. \u201cWe are fast approaching tipping points that will trigger escalating feedback loops of global heating,\u201d he warned. \u2022 In a recorded message, the Queen called on leaders to \u201crise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship\u201d. She added: \u201cOf course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children\u2019s children, and those who will follow in their footsteps.\u201d Following his own speech, Johnson provoked some ridicule by admitting he would fly home rather than take the train.\nShortly before, he had told a roundtable of leaders of developing nations: \u201cWhen it comes to tackling climate change, words without action, without deeds are absolutely pointless.\u201d The commitments on deforestation are an early win for the UK, which as host nation bears responsibility for forging a consensus among the nearly 200 countries present, amid concerns that an overall commitment on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the 45% scientists say is needed this decade will fall short. The political declaration, which is voluntary and not part of the Paris process, is one of a range of side deals that the UK presidency is pushing for at the climate summit in Glasgow alongside others on methane, cars and coal. The package includes \u00a35.3bn of new private finance and \u00a38.75bn of public funding for restoring degraded land, supporting indigenous communities, protecting forests and mitigating wildfire damage. A pledge from CEOs to eliminate activities linked to deforestation, and \u00a31.5bn funding from the UK government for forests, are also part of the deal. \u00a3350m of that will go to Indonesia and \u00a3200m to the Congo basin, with a new \u00a31.1bn fund for the west African rainforest. While the forestry agreement has been cautiously welcomed by ecologists and forest governance experts, they point to previous deals to save forests that have so far failed to stop their destruction, including in 2014. But this time, the EU, China and the US alongside major forested countries like Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Papua New Guinea will all sign the commitment. Many details need to be clarified, particularly how the money is spent, according to Carlos Rittl, who works on Brazil for the Rainforest Foundation Norway. \u201cBig cheques won\u2019t save the forests if the money doesn\u2019t go into the right hands,\u201d he said, emphasising that it should go to indigenous groups and others who are committed to protecting the forest. In a separate announcement, at least \u00a31.25bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local communities by governments and philanthropists for their role in protecting forests. But the promised funds still fall far short of what some believe is needed. \u201cWe are undervalued and our rights are still not respected,\u201d said Mina Setra, an indigenous rights activist from Borneo. \u201cA statement is not enough. We need evidence, not only words.\u201d\n", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/biden-bolsonaro-and-xi-among-leaders-agreeing-to-end-deforestation-aoe", "last_update": "2021-11-02T13:06:49Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Future Score failed mandatory Racing Victoria inspections on Monday and was given until Tuesday morning to confirm fitness. But the horse, one of the genuine outsiders after finishing worse than midfield in three spring appearances, again presented with lameness in his right foreleg and was scratched before the 7:30am deadline.\nThere was better news for Delphi, who was also lame on Cup eve but passed race morning veterinary checks. Delphi has fallen from favour as a Cup chance after running his worst race of the spring in the Caulfield Cup. The import was well-backed to beat Incentivise at Caulfield but was the first horse beaten when 13th of 18 runners.

{"title": "Australians fired for refusing Covid vaccine search social media for \u2018welcoming\u2019 employers", "article": "Unvaccinated Australians who have lost their jobs for refusing to comply with Covid vaccine mandates are using social media to find and share employment opportunities at workplaces where the new rules are not being enforced. Telegram and Facebook have had an influx of people searching for paid jobs after states and territories implemented mandates covering a range of industries from health and aged care workers, teachers and police to construction and hospitality workers. On some job boards, businesses that are happy to accept unvaccinated people advertise that they are \u201cwelcoming of everyone\u201d.\nBeauty therapists, childcare workers, disability support workers and accountants are among 20,000 people who are members of the largest Facebook group for unvaccinated jobseekers in Australia. Ash Heap is an electrician from Geelong who refuses to get vaccinated. \u201cI\u2019m left in a position where I\u2019ve lost my career of 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a lot of options. I was given a small business grant which will see me through for another month but there\u2019s no income.\u201d He owns a house with his partner, who also looks set to lose her job. The pair are hoping the mandate will be dropped. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to rent the house and find work anywhere, doing cash jobs, doing whatever.\u201d Each state and territory has implemented its own rules on mandates. Victoria has one of the most wide-ranging vaccine mandates, which came into effect last month and covers about 1.25 million people. Last week Western Australia announced it would roll out a mandate across multiple industries, including teachers and supermarket staff, representing 75% of the state\u2019s workforce. New South Wales has a mandate in place for some sectors but from 1 December is set to allow the same freedoms for unvaccinated citizens, bar international travel. The mandate for high-risk workers will remain in place. Julian Melvin has been sifting through jobs ads since he lost his work as an arborist because he won\u2019t get the vaccine. He says mainly odd jobs are on offer. \u201cA lot of them it\u2019s like \u2018I need my lawns mowed\u2019 \u2026 cash work here and there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some businesses saying we\u2019ll employ you but how many people are unemployed versus how many people need work?\u201d According to the latest data from the Melbourne Institute, vaccine hesitancy across Australia has been steadily falling from a peak of 33% in May, to 11.8% on 21 October. Hesitancy remained the highest in South Australia (17.9%) followed by Queensland (16.4%) and WA (15.6%). Vaccine hesitancy was much lower in Victoria (8.2%) and in NSW (10%), as well as in the other smaller states and territories (8.4% in the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and the Northern Territory combined). More than 90% of people aged 16 and over in NSW, Victoria and the ACT have received at least one jab. Steve, who did not give his last name, runs Get it Fast Auto Glass in Sunshine. He has been advertising his company on a directory of businesses not requiring staff or clients to be vaccinated. The only other staff member is his wife, and he said he would tell his customers he was unvaccinated if they asked. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cI\u2019m not against vaccines, I\u2019m against people making me do it,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI don\u2019t like someone getting forced to do it.\u201d The managing principal of FCW Lawyers, Andrew Douglas, said if an industry fell under a government mandate, it was not possible to challenge it. But some employees were arguing they can work from home to avoid having to comply. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a lot of people going, \u2018I can work from home,\u2019\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a lot of people bring medical evidence.\u201d At the same time, more businesses were asking for advice on implementing their own Covid jab mandate to avoid losing clients. \u201cWe\u2019re now starting to get employers who are saying we\u2019ve got a problem, no one will come to our sites with unvaccinated people.\u201d\nThe Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Paul Guerra, said one of the biggest challenges was the risk of businesses losing staff. \u201cIt is up to the individual and their employer whether work can be adapted to be done at home,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cAfter two long, hard years for Victorian businesses, our primary concern right now is getting back up and running and having a bumper summer trading period.\u201d Another emerging issue for employees who are vaccinated is whether they feel safe working alongside those who have not got the jab, said an associate lecturer in law at Monash University, Liam Elphick. \u201cEmployers have obligations under work safety laws to prevent against workplace risk, not just address it when it happens,\u201d Elphick said. Covid safety was likely to become \u201cthe main arena\u201d of disputes going forward, he said, as vaccinated employees made sure all the necessary checks and balances, including vaccines, were put in place. \u201cAnyone has the ability to raise concerns about an unsafe workplace,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/australians-fired-for-refusing-covid-vaccine-search-social-media-for-welcoming-employers", "last_update": "2021-11-02T03:12:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Succession recap: series three, episode three \u2013 \u2018Paranoid Kendroid\u2019 wages war", "article": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season three, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episode three. A large bowl of snake linguine with a side order of sibling betrayal? Don\u2019t mind if we do. Here\u2019s your guide to the eventful third episode, titled The Disruption \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m happy in my headspace\u2019 We rejoined the game of billionaire brinkmanship with rogue son Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) lunching a journalist and revelling in the \u201cshitshow\u201d at Waystar Royco. Advertisers were bailing. Interim boss Gerri Kellman (J Smith-Cameron) was \u201ca time-server who\u2019s way out of her depth\u201d. Ken was cutting an immunity deal with the DoJ and determined to \u201cplant a flag\u201d inside the family firm. Over a shaved fennel salad, Kendall feigned amusement at TV satirist Sophie Iwobi\u2019s (guest star and real-life comic Ziwe) recent monologue about him. As for the vexed question of his siblings, he insisted: \u201cI\u2019m just really happy in my headspace. And I hope they\u2019re happy in theirs.\u201d Always with the unconvincing psychobabble. Iwobi had become Ken\u2019s obsession. He made a roomful of party-goers watch her next takedown of him, insisting it was great to be \u201cpart of the conversation\u201d. He was still rewatching the clip the next day. Along with vanity-searching his name on Twitter, it was half ego, half masochism. Worst of all, he was determined to appear on Iwobi\u2019s show, The Disruption, just to prove he was in on the joke. His PRs looked nervous. Rightly so. Waystar were on the defensive\n\u201cHow\u2019s your headspace?\u201d That was the new catchphrase of sarky Roman (Kieran Culkin) as the top team gathered to strategise. Back from Sarajevo and ensconced at Waystar\u2019s Manhattan HQ, patriarch Logan (Brian Cox) was snapping at Gerri and reversing her decisions, worried that \u201cour acting CEO is getting too fucking acting\u201d. If Kendall dared come in to plant his so-called flag, Logan would punch him on the nose. Reasonable. New \u201cEl Presidente\u201d Shiv (Sarah Snook) promised to scope out big bro\u2019s plans at that night\u2019s journalism dinner and would lead a town hall event to reassure staff. Comms chief Hugo (Fisher Stevens) had drawn up print ads responding to the accusations. Tagline: \u201cWe get it.\u201d \u201cA bit like those ladies on the cruise ships got it?\u201d, scoffed Roman. Shiv agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like, yeah yeah, we get it already, stop moaning about the rapes.\u201d Back to the drawing board. The next phase of the propaganda campaign was the siblings doing stage-managed interviews, \u201csharing memories and feelings about their dad\u201d. Good luck with that. Meanwhile, the FBI wanted to serve subpoena documents but Logan told them to \u201cfuck off\u201d. Gerri counselled him to co-operate ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. Nope, still \u201cfuck off\u201d. Well, he\u2019s got a catchphrase hasn\u2019t he. Greg was being bullied from both sides Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) was trying to straddle both sides of the feuding family but pleasing precisely nobody. Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), always happy to punch down, pranked him with fake cyanide pills, before showing \u201cthe leggy princeling of ATN\u201d to his new office \u2013 a glorified store cupboard. Despite being self-conscious about his \u201csmall wrists\u201d, Greg couldn\u2019t contain his excitement that Kendall was gifting him a high-rolling watch. Except there were crossed wires. He was merely \u201chooking Greg up\u201d and the watch would cost him $40,000. Greg went through with the purchase to save face, which became even more galling when the Swiss timepiece stopped ticking. What\u2019s the time? Cringe o\u2019clock. Kendall v Shiv: round 1 After a snarky exchange with old flame Nate Sofrelli (Ashley Zukerman) \u2013 still crackles of chemistry there? \u2013 Shiv confronted Kendall at the journalism bash. She asked him not to scare the horses ahead of next week\u2019s shareholder vote, assuring him they had the same aim: fix the company from the inside. Still high on his messiah complex, Kendall smirked: \u201cHe made you get all dressed up for this? I\u2019m sorry for you, Siobhan.\u201d She was now the one doing daddy\u2019s bidding. As he gloated, she glowered. When she reported back, Logan wanted his only daughter to help rehabilitate his image by declaring he \u201cisn\u2019t some dirty old man\u201d. Cue a wary exchange where Shiv gave a deeply unconvincing answer to \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d. She knew about criminality in the cruise division from Tom but Logan played it down, promising he could handle it. Did his political influence extend to the law? Wambsgans the sacrificial lamb Drunk and maudlin after a lawyer meeting, Tom seemed certain he was jail-bound for his part in the cruise cover-up. Ever ambitious, he hatched a plan with Shiv to \u201cfind some benefit\u201d in his predicament by going to Logan and offering himself as a sacrifice. All heart, Shiv demurred for all of 10 seconds before admitting the idea was \u201ckind of genius\u201d because \u201ceither way, you bank gold with my dad\u201d. In a whispered conversation at ATN, Tom offered to be the fall guy. \u201cI\u2019ll step up and go down,\u201d he vowed. Logan looked bewildered by the fact that his son-in-law didn\u2019t want anything in return. Oh, Tom. He can\u2019t even play the hero properly. Kendall v Shiv: round 2\nAgainst advice, Kendall headed into the office to \u201csend shockwaves\u201d and not let \u201cdad dominate the battle space\u201d. Panic stations ensued, with staff scrambling as Kendall \u2013 key card revoked \u2013 tried to gain access to the building. Kendall\u2019s tense progress through the office included greeting a mailroom worker with \u201cWassup bro, doing the heavy lifting?\u201d and a stilted chat with Tom, telling him \u201cAnother life is possible\u201d. When Kendall sent his sidekick out with a shopping list, we knew something was afoot. At the town hall, Shiv addressed employees about \u201ccorporate responsibility\u201d. \u201cWe get it,\u201d she said (cut to Hugo looking proud). However, her smooth speech was soon drowned out by Rape Me by Nirvana blaring from speakers placed on balconies around the atrium. As security struggled to turn the music off, Shiv was forced to abandon her speech. Even more embarrassingly, the shambles was being live-streamed to Waystar offices worldwide. Incandescent with icy fury, Shiv marched into Kendall\u2019s office, saw the empty speaker boxes and proceeded to viciously spit into her brother\u2019s notebook. A stunt from their school days, maybe. Now it meant war. Kendall v Shiv: round 3 Backstage at The Disruption, Kendall was running through the jokes he\u2019d had scripted for him. In an excruciating scene, he gatecrashed the writers\u2019 room, telling them \u201cHurt me, I can take it\u201d. Can you, though, Ken? Minutes before he was due on-air, Shiv delivered her killer blow. In a faux-concerned open letter, she questioned Kendall\u2019s mental health, calling him \u201ca drug addict, serial liar and absentee father with a history of problematic relationships with women\u201d. It was so brutal, brothers Roman and Connor (Alan Ruck) had refused to co-sign it. A quietly devastating 90-second sequence saw Kendall walk off down the corridor of the TV studio, his face falling from false grin to haunted despair, still clutching those cue cards as he slumped to the floor in a server room and watched Iwobi \u201cempty chair\u201d him on-screen. A bravura performance from Jeremy Strong, beautifully soundtracked by Nicholas Britell. \u2018Open up. Let them in. We\u2019re cooperating\u2019\nRoman could barely conceal his boredom during his interview with ATN Business, but waxed lyrical about a fly fishing trip to Montana with his father. Heartbreakingly, this turned out to be a repurposed \u201cmulti-use happy childhood memory\u201d \u2013 Connor had actually taken him. What\u2019s more, the old man rubbed Roman\u2019s nose in it, cruelly sneering: \u201cAww, I wuv my daddy. I never figured you for a faggot.\u201d This dysfunctional family tableau was interrupted by 20 FBI agents storming the building. Logan issued his usual response, only for Gerri to tell him: \u201cThese are the ones who don\u2019t fuck off. This is a search warrant.\u201d Not only had the deputy attorney-general been spooked by Logan\u2019s shady pow-wow with senior White House aide Michelle-Anne Vanderhoven (Linda Emond) but Kendall told his lawyer to push for a raid to show \u201cthe government\u2019s not gone soft-cock on big corp\u201d. With cameras outside, it wasn\u2019t wise to resist. Looking defeated and suddenly old \u2013 like in Sarajevo \u2013 Logan finally relented. Across town, Kendall watched the raid footage on his phone with the glimmer of a grin. The heir apparent Still Shiv \u2013 but only just. Logan put Gerri in place for \u201coptics\u201d and wanted to keep Shiv clean because she was the long-term successor. But with Feds kicking the door down and hostile investors hovering, how long will it be Logan\u2019s decision to make? Line of the week Sophie Iwobi\u2019s string of nicknames for Kendall: \u201cOedipussy, Wokestar Royco, Paranoid Kendroid, Benedickhead Arnold, Snitchie Rich, a jar of mayonnaise in a Prada suit \u2026\u201d Oof. Notes and observations This cracking episode was directed by Cathy Yan, whose credits include DC\u2019s Harley Quinn film Birds of Prey, making her the first Asian woman (and only the second woman full stop) to helm a superhero movie. In that stretch limo with champagne on tap, naturally Kendall and his crew were listening to Money All the Time by Balance. Shiv and Tom\u2019s pantyhose-eating pet pooch was named Mondale, after Democratic politician Walter Mondale who died in April. Perhaps this was Succession\u2019s way of paying tribute. Rejoin us next Monday to see whose headspace is happiest.

{"title": "Kilman and Jim\u00e9nez punish sloppy Everton and heap pressure on Ben\u00edtez", "article": "On the night when Wolves fans chanted \u201cBruno, Bruno\u201d on the final whistle to indicate their new manager Bruno Lage is definitely proving more of a success at his new club than his predecessor Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has been at Tottenham Hotspur, the mantle as the Premier League\u2019s most under-pressure manager is now heading towards Rafael Ben\u00edtez.\nEverton were woeful in a first half when Max Kilman scored his first Premier League goal before Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez hit his first at Molineux in over a year. Even if Alex Iwobi\u2019s strike early in the second half presaged a spirited rally, this is an alarming slump for a team who had lost only one of their opening seven games. Never had a Ben\u00edtez team conceded five goals in a Premier League game before the collapse against Watford a week last Saturday and at half-time at Molineux there was the serious possibility of a repeat. Wolves were slicing with ease through a midfield in which Jean-Philippe Gbamin, the \u00a325m signing from Mainz, was suffering his own belated Halloween nightmare. He was replaced by Fabian Delph at half-time. On the day Nuno was dismissed just 10 league games into his reign at White Hart Lane, there could be question marks over the stability of Ben\u00edtez\u2019s tenure. When the new Everton manager claimed that \u201cwe are missing something\u201d it needed clarifying that he meant \u201cnot only one or two but three or four important\u201d players through injury rather than something more integral such as spirit or tactical confidence. Both were severely lacking in the first half. Without Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes, Everton were indeed missing an important spine and the impact Delph had in the second half, despite not being match fit, backed up Ben\u00edtez\u2019s stance. \u201cYou can see he can take the ball, pass the ball, bring players around him into the game and win the second balls.\n\u201cThe character and mentality of this squad is to fight, as they showed in the second half.\u201d Ben\u00edtez admitted that he was \u201csurprised\u201d by his side\u2019s first-half inferiority when Wolves managed to combine the best of their early-season form with the goals they lacked in those three opening defeats. They have now gained 13 points from a possible 15 with Jim\u00e9nez back to his rampant best, leading the press from the front that enables Lage\u2019s game plan to work at its best. R\u00faben Neves is also back in his pomp and, restored to the starting lineup, he dispatched a fulsome volley from the edge of the area that was brilliantly parried by Jordan Pickford, who also tipped over Francisco Trinc\u00e3o\u2019s shot.\nHwang Hee-Chan had a goal disallowed for offside but broke through after another run of conviction by Jim\u00e9nez earned a corner which Rayan Ait-Nouri dispatched for Kilman to head home. Four minutes later Jim\u00e9nez was sharp again, reacting quickest to Ben Godfrey\u2019s backpass that was vaguely towards Pickford. Clean through, the Mexican dinked a sumptuous shot over the keeper for his 50th goal for the club, after nine months out with a fractured skull.\nEverton switched to 4-3-3, in a bid to stem the flood, and they got their first sniff of goal when Romain Sa\u00efss sliced an attempted clearance to offer Demarai Gray a great chance but the in-form forward fired well wide. After the interval it was a much closer affair. Conor Coady injured himself in blocking Richarlison from what appeared a certain goal after Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, receiving a routine back pass, inexplicably played the ball straight to the Brazilian forward inside the six-yard box. Having taken heart, the visiting team were able to play higher up the field, penning Wolves back. Godfrey, coming inside, shot low and Iwobi converted a rebound from Coady\u2019s block. Game on. Wolves finally came back out of retreat and should have made the game safe. Hee-Chan Hwang laid the ball off for Trinc\u00e3o to jink inside but shoot wide before Jim\u00e9nez headed against a post. Everton kept pushing for the equaliser, S\u00e1 tipping the substitute Anthony Gordon\u2019s header to safety, but after that shocking first half, Wolves deserved the win that takes them seventh.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/01/wolves-everton-premier-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-01T23:52:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Joanna Lumley and the Human Swan review \u2013 heartening optimism in the face of climate despair", "article": "Joanna Lumley and the Human Swan is a title that could only fly (sorry) in England. At a time when we are all looking for gentle, non-toxic ways to define ourselves, let us seize upon ITV\u2019s eco-minded documentary. And, of course, on Joanna Lumley herself. (Not that way, Purdey-people. Behave yourselves.) Everything about Lumley is old-fashioned in the best way. The charm, the elegance, the grace. The wit and the bone-deep confidence. It is all redolent of a slower, calmer era. She glides serenely through her presenting duties in the likes of Joanna Lumley\u2019s Postcards and Silk Road Adventure, reminding us all \u2013 even those of us too young to have any recollection of them \u2013 of the days when the world seemed full of wonder, instead of the absolute shambles of today. It is this charm that makes her the ideal choice of travel companion for biologist and conservationist Sacha Dench\u2019s (AKA \u201cthe Human Swan\u201d) 3,000 mile trip around Britain by eco-conscious paramotor. The pair travel the nation, meeting people tackling the climate emergency, with Dench due to continue on to the Cop26 summit to call attention not just to the current crisis but to the solutions that are possible. Dench got her nickname when she took to her paramotor (a kind of hang-glider with a rechargeable battery) and accompanied a flock of critically endangered Bewick\u2019s swans along their entire three-month-long migration path from freezing Arctic Russia to France. Her mission? To show how and why their numbers have fallen so sharply, and call for conservation action along the flyway to protect the remaining birds. Lumley joins Dench as she and her flight partner Dan Burton prepare to take off from North Ayrshire and begin the battery-powered circumnavigation of our septic isle. Lumley follows Dench\u2019s instructions on how to hoist the parachute that will help give her lift-off. \u201cBe near me forever, Sacha,\u201d says Lumley as she yanks on the strangely fearsome-looking equipment. Then Dench is, literally, off and running. Or, absolutely literally, running and then off, riding the thermals and making her way down the west coast and next meeting Lumley at Swansea Bay. There they are shown the suffering of the kittiwake, a small gull whose population has declined by 40% since the 1970s, thanks to climate change that causes storms that disturb the surface water and leaves them unable to see and catch fish. Warming oceans also affect the breeding of the sand eels upon which chicks depend for food, causing further problems. And so on and so on, each little change rolling into another until \u2013 to use entirely the wrong metaphor in a paragraph about global heating \u2013 we snowball into catastrophe. But then we meet Natasha Jenkins, also of Swansea, who got so sick of seeing so much of the waste humanity\u2019s insanity creates every year washing up on their local shore that she set up the anti-litter campaign Don\u2019t Be a Tosser on social media. There are now hundreds of litter-picking volunteers who go out in groups and make \u2013 literally again, as they stuff other people\u2019s crap into sacks \u2013 bags of difference to their environment. On we go, round the coastline, having bad news broken to us gently and then good ideas proffered with ever-charming, seemingly genuine enthusiasm by the ever-charming and seemingly genuine Lumley. \u201cListen!\u201d she confides urgently yet ebulliently to the camera, \u201cwe can ALL do this!\u201d A visit to Bristol, winner of this year\u2019s Gold Sustainable Food City award, for a locally grown feast and tour of a hydroponic vertical-farm-within-a-shipping-crate delights her. \u201cI think it\u2019s crackers that we fly so much produce from thousands of miles away!\u201d The pair also travel to the UK\u2019s first zero-carbon community, in south London, and observe the erosion on the White Cliffs of Dover. Yes, the level of analysis sometimes feels slightly basic, but this is a programme that aims to avoid preaching, while still engaging the unconverted. Yes, you could argue that the time for individual action diverting us from the path of destruction is long past, but what good does the counsel of despair ever do? Will more politicians be moved to more action by pressure from engaged citizens or from those sitting silently frozen in fear? The programme is bookended by the awful news that Burton and Dench suffered an air collision towards the end of their trip in which Burton was killed and Dench seriously injured. She and Burton\u2019s family wanted the programme to be finished and broadcast. Its wholesome, accessible optimism is \u2013 hopefully \u2013 exactly what they wanted.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/01/joanna-lumley-and-the-human-swan-review-heartening-optimism-in-the-face-of-climate-despair", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:47:20Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Yorkshire CCC are institutionally racist. For me there is no other conclusion | Jonathan Liew", "article": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club are institutionally racist. There: that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? For years Yorkshire enabled, tolerated and normalised a dressing-room culture of racist discourse. They failed to create a welcoming environment for Muslims and other ethnic minorities. They continued and continue to employ staff who have made racist comments. When a former player raised serious allegations of longstanding racist behaviour three years ago, the club initially did nothing and then reportedly offered him a six-figure payout to keep quiet. Under investigation, they have chosen at every turn to prioritise their own reputation and their own people. It is true that an investigative panel found that Azeem Rafiq\u2019s exclusion from the team was based on his cricket, and not his race. It is also true the panel may not have found sufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire are institutionally racist. But frankly, to me, to draw any other conclusion is not simply a refutation of the available evidence but a form of moral cowardice.\nSo far, so cathartic. For all the comic ineptitude and farcical missteps Yorkshire have displayed in the handling of their racism investigation, anger remains the prevailing emotion here: anger at how long all this has taken, anger at the stories that have emerged so far, anger at the culture of shameless corporate self-interest that infects so much of this country\u2019s executive class. Above all, you feel angry on behalf of Rafiq, a man who just wanted to bowl some off-spin and win some cricket games for Yorkshire, and who instead has found himself co-opted into a cruel fight for justice that has robbed him of his time and his joy, his human complexity, his dignity and occasionally his sanity. One of the hallmarks of this episode is that every time you feel Yorkshire have plumbed their own capacity for moral decrepitude, they somehow manage to drill even lower. Monday morning was another such moment: according to ESPNCricinfo, a current senior Yorkshire player admitted regularly addressing Rafiq using the P-word, but was cleared by the investigation of wrongdoing on the basis that it was \u201cnot reasonable for Azeem to have been offended\u201d. Such words, the panel argued, fell under the banner of \u201cgood-natured banter between friends\u201d. If these latest revelations teach us anything, it is that the report commissioned by Yorkshire almost 14 months ago, dragged through a mangle of delays and obfuscations, and released (in summary) during the chaotic cancellation of the fifth Test between England and India, is barely worth the USB drive it was uploaded to. Key figures were not interviewed. Since Rafiq first went public with his testimony in a wisden.com interview in August 2020 \u2013 an account backed up by numerous former teammates and staff \u2013 the Yorkshire chairman, Roger Hutton, has not given a single public interview.\nThe sadness is that there are plenty of decent, principled, appalled people still working at Yorkshire today, but very few of them are in positions of real power. According to the Yorkshire Post some senior figures at the club are disgruntled it has not taken a more hostile line against Rafiq. This is a good example of how the struggle against racism is part of a broader fight against entitlement and entrenched privilege, be it through status or wealth or gender or connections. The point being: all this goes far deeper than simple acts of racist abuse, what words we deem acceptable or not or the futures of individuals. This is about how institutions protect themselves and resist change, about where power lies in our game and how it replicates.\nIn 2003, when Darren Lehmann was banned for calling a Sri Lankan opponent a \u201cblack cunt\u201d during a one-day international for Australia, his county, Yorkshire, refused to take any action. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it was malicious, far from it,\u201d said Colin Graves, the chairman at the time. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed the ICC has taken it down this route. He is not a racist.\u201d Case closed; ancient history. Except Graves ended up running English cricket. Lehmann ended up coaching Deccan Chargers and Australia and this year was welcomed back to Headingley as coach of the Northern Superchargers in the Hundred. Imagine all the cricketers of colour who will have played under them, the staff who owed their livelihoods to them, the youngsters who went through the pathways they controlled. Imagine how little power they had and how much Graves and Lehmann enjoyed by comparison. That is institutional racism in action. Yorkshire acted shamefully, but they didn\u2019t act alone. Senior white England players continue to avoid discussing racism out of squeamishness. The England and Wales Cricket Board, now making its own inquiries, spent years turning a blind eye to racism in the English game before finally deciding in 2020 there might be some good PR in all this George Floyd stuff. Even now, with its T-shirt gimmicks and a communications department bigger than many countries\u2019 coaching staff, it gives the impression of a body less concerned with improving the game than with being able to say it has improved the game.\nAs another month ticks by, Rafiq continues to wait for justice. He really was a very decent bowler in his prime, a clever spinner with subtle changes of flight and an underrated batting technique, an England Under-19s captain who with a little love and little luck could easily have developed into an international cricketer. He\u2019s still only 30. And yet right now, his defining legacy in the game is as a victim of someone else\u2019s racism. In a crowded field, that may well be the biggest injustice of all.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/nov/01/yorkshire-cricket-are-institutionally-racist-for-me-there-is-no-other-conclusion", "last_update": "2021-11-02T08:30:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ghislaine Maxwell prosecutors can call accusers \u2018victims\u2019, judge rules", "article": "Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sex trafficking case will be permitted to use the words \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d in referencing accusers during her forthcoming trial in federal court in New York, it was ruled on Monday. Judge Alison Nathan\u2019s decision permitting the use of \u201cvictim\u201d stemmed from a challenge by Maxwell\u2019s defense team, which had requested that the word be barred from the trial, due to begin in Manhattan this month. Nathan said: \u201cPrecluding the word is both unnecessary and impractical.\u201d \u201cIt is appropriate to use the terms as representative of its litigation position,\u201d Nathan said of the prosecution. This proceeding is only the second time that Maxwell, the British media heiress and former girlfriend of the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has appeared in a courtroom in person for her case, amid restrictions relating to the coronavirus pandemic. Epstein killed himself in federal jail in New York in August 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy charges.\nThe use of \u201cvictim\u201d in criminal cases has drawn attention, especially given a recent decision in the Kyle Rittenhouse case in Wisconsin. Rittenhouse faces two homicide counts, and one attempted homicide count, in relation to shooting three people during protests in Kenosha last year after a white police officer wounded a local Black father, Jacob Blake. The judge in Rittenhouse\u2019s trial, which began on Monday, created controversy when he ruled last week that prosecutors could not call those Rittenhouse shot \u201cvictims\u201d, although the defense team could refer to them as \u201crioters\u201d or \u201clooters\u201d. Prosecutors in Maxwell\u2019s case had also asked for Nathan to let them use pseudonyms, or first names only, for some accusers and witnesses at trial, and the judge agreed. \u201cGiven the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment and embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward,\u201d Nathan explained. \u201cJust because some victims\u2019 names are publicly available does not mean that the details of their experiences are already available,\u201d Nathan also said, noting that \u201calleged victims will testify in explicit detail\u201d Maxwell is charged for allegedly procuring girls for Epstein to sexually abuse from 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors say that some of Maxwell\u2019s victims were as young as 14. If convicted, she faces up to 80 years in federal prison. She has denied all the charges. On Monday, she appeared exhausted as she was led into court with handcuffs and ankle restraints, which were later removed. Federal prosecutors disclosed that they have not offered Maxwell a plea deal. Maxwell, 59, helped Epstein \u201crecruit , groom, and ultimately abuse victims\u201d whom they knew were minors, it is alleged. She also \u201cfirst attempted to befriend some of Epstein\u2019s minor victims prior to their abuse, including by asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their families. Maxwell and Epstein would spend time building friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor victims to the movies or shopping,\u201d prosecutors have said. \u201cSome of these outings would involve Maxwell and Epstein spending time together with a minor victim, while some would involve Maxwell or Epstein spending time alone with a minor victim,\u201d prosecutors said of the alleged grooming process, adding: \u201cHaving developed a rapport with a victim, Maxwell would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim \u2026 discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein.\u201d Opening arguments are expected on 29 November.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-accusers-victims", "last_update": "2021-11-02T14:34:18Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Two more Mexican journalists killed as reporters condemn worsening violence", "article": "Mexican journalists have expressed alarm after two veteran reporters were attacked in their own homes in less than 24 hours, bringing this year\u2019s death toll for media workers to nine \u2013 already surpassing the eight deaths recorded in 2020. Fredy L\u00f3pez Ar\u00e9valo, a veteran reporter in the southern state of Chiapas, was shot in the head inside his home in the city of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas on Thursday. L\u00f3pez had covered Central American politics and the Zapatista uprising for news organisations such as Reuters, the Los Angeles Times and Notimex, and he still reported on the local political situation. On the same day, Acapulco journalist Alfredo Cardoso was pulled from his home by masked gunmen who also threatened his family. He was found the next day having been shot five times, and died from his injuries in hospital on Sunday, according to press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders. Cardoso previously worked as a photojournalist in Acapulco, a city which was once the jewel in the crown of Mexican tourist destinations but has been a hotbed of drug cartel violence for more than a decade. More recently he was the manager of the online news site Revista Dos Costas. \u201cThe situation for journalists in Acapulco and all of Guerrero [state] has worsened,\u201d said Bernandino Hern\u00e1ndez, a photojournalist in the coastal city. \u201cJournalists have been threatened, some have had to flee. It\u2019s a really dicey situation,\u201d he said. No suspects have been arrested for either crime. Crimes committed against Mexican journalists almost always wallow in impunity \u2013 the product of inept and inadequate investigations, a lack of political will to stop the killings of media workers and frequent collusion between drug cartels. The two attacks reinforced Mexico\u2019s reputation as the most murderous country for journalists in the hemisphere.\nThe country\u2019s murder rate has steadily risen since the then president Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared a militarized crackdown on drug cartels in 2006. In the same period, attacks on journalists have also skyrocketed. Analysts say those most at risk are reporters who cover the intersection between local politics and the drugs trade. \u201cThese murders take place within a context of continuously deteriorating security in the country, for all citizens, but particularly for human rights defenders and journalists,\u201d said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cThese attacks are fueled by impunity, which is almost complete in crimes against the press. The government of [President Andr\u00e9s Manuel] L\u00f3pez Obrador has been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to strengthen the justice state or protect journalists.\u201d Mexico recorded 36,773 homicides in 2020, in spite of the pandemic and quarantines, according to the state statistics service INEGI \u2013 slightly higher than the 36,661 homicides registered in 2019.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/mexico-journalists-killed-violence-reporters", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:56:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Macron steps back from midnight threat against UK exports in fishing row", "article": "France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has shelved his threat to clog up UK exports and ban its fishers from landing catches at French ports from midnight in a dispute over access to British fishing waters, as his deadline approached. Discussions resumed after a proposal was put forward by Macron\u2019s government late on Monday. Downing Street had previously said it was bracing for Paris to deliver on its vow to retaliate over the issue of fishing permits. \u201cSince this afternoon, discussions have resumed on the basis of a proposal I made to prime minister [Boris] Johnson. The talks need to continue,\u201d Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we are tomorrow at the end of the day, to see if things have really changed.\u201d A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the French government\u2019s announcement that they will not go ahead with implementing their proposed measures as planned tomorrow. As we have said consistently, we are ready to continue intensive discussions on fisheries \u2026 We welcome France\u2019s acknowledgement that in-depth discussions are needed to resolve the range of difficulties in the UK-EU relationship.\u201d France had been expected to impose extra customs checks and ban British fishing boats at some French ports from midnight. Official sources initially reported that neither side was backing down in the post-Brexit row. However, David Frost, the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, is to meet Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, the French minister for EU affairs, in Paris on Thursday, to discuss possible ways out of the crisis. Beaune tweeted that he had already spoken to Frost on Monday and that he expected a response to Paris\u2019s compromise proposal by Wednesday. He wrote that he looked forward to an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d with Frost over the range of post-Brexit issues causing problems in the British-Franco relationship. France has been infuriated that some of its small boats are being denied permission to fish in the waters around the UK and Channel Islands. The UK insists its licensing regime is reasonable and it will continue to require boats to provide evidence that they have previously fished in those waters on at least four days in the last four years. Johnson and Macron had bumped fists as they arrived at the Cop26 summit on Monday. At a post-G20 press conference on Sunday, Macron initially insisted that Britain had to give ground or France would trigger trade reprisals this week. \u201cThe ball is in Britain\u2019s court. If the British make no movement, the measures of 2 November will have to be put in place,\u201d he said. But on Monday evening, the French president said he had pushed back the deadline by which Paris had said it would impose the new measures. Earlier in the day, Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, had told France it had 48 hours to back down on threats or Britain would begin dispute talks set out in the Brexit deal. A spokesman for Johnson suggested there would not be retaliatory UK trade measures, but action could be triggered through the dispute mechanism. \u201cDepending on if, or what, the French decide to do, we will enact them as and when we need to,\u201d he said. A meeting to find a compromise, organised by the European Commission with officials from the UK, Jersey and France, had initially been marked by a lack of movement by both sides on Monday, with sources describing the mood as sour. Jersey\u2019s government was preparing to provide its fishers with financial support in the expectation that its vessels would not be able to land catches in French ports. The Jersey Fishermen\u2019s Association (JFA) also called for the island\u2019s authorities to respond in kind to the expected crisis by closing off the whelk and scallop fisheries to French vessels and banning dredging and trawling \u201cwith immediate effect for a period of six weeks\u201d. The talks continued late into the evening, however. The diplomatic row over fishing, a very small sector of the UK economy, threatened to overshadow the G20 talks, which took place in Rome at the weekend, and also the Cop26 summit. Almost 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in UK waters, equating to 98% of EU applications for fishing licences, the UK government says, but this figure is disputed in Paris. The main area of disagreement is over the number of small French vessels given access to the immediate coastal waters of the UK and Jersey. On Monday evening, the UK government spokesperson said it would consider any new evidence to support the remaining licence applications.\nTruss had suggested on Monday that Macron may be making \u201cunreasonable threats\u201d because he has a difficult election looming. Asked about whether France and the UK had come to an agreement, she told Sky News: \u201cThe deal hasn\u2019t been done. The French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry and they need to withdraw those threats.\u201d Asked why the row had emerged, she said: \u201cYou might say there\u2019s a French election coming up.\u201d Seeming angered by the dispute, she added: \u201cI\u2019m not remotely happy about what has happened.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/uk-braces-for-french-trade-reprisals-from-midnight-in-fishing-row", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:11:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Dave Halls, in a statement to the New York Post, did not address the details of the incident, which occurred during filming of the desert western Rust last month near Santa Fe in New Mexico but said he was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d at the death of Hutchins.\nAccording to court documents, Halls told Baldwin the gun was \u201ccold\u201d or safe when he handed it to him during a rehearsal on set, in costume. Halls was also quoted as telling Santa Fe sheriff\u2019s department investigators that he did not thoroughly check the gun before handing it to Baldwin. Hutchins was shot and killed and director Joel Souza was wounded in the shoulder when the gun went off. Authorities in Santa Fe are investigating the incident, including how live rounds got onto the set, and say they have not ruled out criminal charges. \u201cHalyna Hutchins was not just one of the most talented people I\u2019ve worked with, but also a friend,\u201d Halls said in the statement. \u201cI\u2019m shocked and saddened by her death,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that this tragedy prompts the industry to re-evaluate its values and practices to ensure no one is harmed through the creative process again.\u201d The tragedy prompted questions about Halls\u2019 conduct on the day and in some past productions when he was overseeing action on the set.

Baldwin on Saturday said he would support limits on the use of real guns in films and television shows, and described Hutchins as a friend. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert in this field.

{"title": "Cop26: welcome to Glasgow \u2013 the world is watching", "article": "For a conference that had already been delayed by a year, perhaps this was a fitting start for the delegates and world leaders who made their way to Cop26 with a mission to save the planet. It was raining. There was no shelter. And the thousands of participants who had come to the UK from all four corners of the globe faced the mother of all queues to get inside. Welcome to Glasgow. This was not the most promising start for a conference seen by most observers as a last chance to save the world from climate change. But perhaps the wind and grey would help to focus minds on the task at hand.\nAfter all, the stakes have never been higher. The political leaders here all know that they\u2019re on the hook. In the past they may have quibbled over the science, or questioned the figures. But this was a year in which the climate crisis came into more people\u2019s lives than ever before. Many of their countries experienced record temperatures, wildfires, droughts and floods. Outside the conference, the demonstrators who chanted and sang were a constant reminder that there is a generation of people with a much clearer sense of what is going on \u2013 and a willingness to blame those who fail to assume responsibility and sort it out. In the pavilion, a makeshift village near the entrance to the site where NGOs, countries and corporations have set up pitches, there was a lifesize model of polar bears stuck on ice at the Tuvalu stand, and a sculpture of a penguin hanging itself. On every stand people were eager to talk and communicate the urgency they all felt. But it was in the blue zone, right at the centre of the conference, where the proper meetings would take place. And here, beyond the protesters and the queues and the polar bears, past the crowds of delegates with lanyards and briefcases, deep in the heart of the conference there was an undeniable sense of purpose as the leaders began their speeches and things finally got under way.\nWhat most of them would have made of Boris Johnson\u2019s address is anyone\u2019s guess. The host of the event, the ringmaster of this diplomatic circus, the UK prime minister started his speech talking about the city\u2019s most famous fictional son: James Bond, likening the situation facing the world to a ticking timebomb. \u201cWe might not feel like James Bond, or look like James Bond, but Cop26 must be the start of defusing that bomb. Yes, it is going to be hard, but yes, we can do it,\u201d he said. It was a step up, perhaps, from the speech he gave to the UN general assembly a month ago, in which he referenced the Muppets\u2019 character, Kermit the Frog. It was the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Amor Mottley, who better captured the sense of urgency. She accused countries of making promises based on technology that still doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cThis is at best reckless and at worst dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cOur people are watching, and our people are taking note. And are we really going to leave Scotland without the resolve and the ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and to save our planet?\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was emphatic too. \u201cWe are digging our own graves,\u201d he said, as he urged G20 countries responsible for 80% of emissions to return to Cop every year with new commitments, rather than every five years as before. He also spoke about the importance of reaching the $100bn a year target promised in Paris in 2015. And he reminded those listening about the children, the next generation, who were watching. \u201cThe climate action army \u2013 led by young people \u2013 is unstoppable. They are larger. They are louder. And, I assure you, they are not going away,\u201d he said. Once again, it was the veteran broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough, who somehow found the words that got delegates out of their seats. He told the conference that humans were the \u201cgreatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth\u201d, and it not beyond the wit of man to \u201cturn this tragedy into a triumph\u201d. \u201cWe now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse,\u201d he said. Some of the most desperate calls for help came from poorer countries, many of whom have populations most at risk from escalating temperatures. Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi, from the Kingdom of Bhutan, who is chair of the least developed countries group at UN climate change negotiations, which represents the world\u2019s poorest 48 nations, said \u201cwords alone are not enough\u201d. \u201cWe cannot leave Glasgow without strong commitments that will ensure the survival of the billion people living in the [least developed countries].\u201d Young Kenyan activist Elizabeth Wathuti closed this part of the ceremony. \u201cI have seen with my own eyes three young children crying at the side of a dried-up river after walking 12 miles with their mother to find water,\u201d she said. President Biden was one of a few delegates who appeared to nod off as the speeches went on. He showed up late after flying into Edinburgh earlier in the day and being driven to Glasgow in a motorcade. At least he got there, unlike veteran correspondent Wolf Blitzer from CNN who was sent to Edinburgh to report on the conference. \u201cShould\u2019ve gone to Glasgow,\u201d said Specsavers\u2019 Twitter account.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-sense-of-purpose-at-cop26-is-tangible", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:53:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Supreme court appears open to allowing challenge to Texas abortion law", "article": "A majority of the US supreme court appeared skeptical of a controversial Texas law that gives private citizens the right to file civil lawsuits to enforce a six-week abortion ban.\nThe threat of expensive litigation posed by the ban has had a chilling effect and halted the vast majority of abortions in America\u2019s second-largest state, which is home to more than 6 million women of child-bearing age. Over nearly three hours of arguments on Monday the nine-member bench heard from three parties: attorneys for Texas, the Biden administration and abortion providers. The focus of arguments was whether Texas can allow private citizens to enforce an abortion ban in direct contradiction of supreme court precedent in Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that provides a constitutional right to abortion up to roughly 24 weeks, and whether the federal government then has the standing to stop the law in court. Although laws deemed unconstitutional are often described as \u201cstruck down\u201d by courts, in fact courts block specific officials from enforcing laws. Texas made it difficult for courts to scrutinize the law by making it difficult to identify who they would block from enforcing it, having, in the words of chief justice John Roberts last month, \u201cdelegated enforcement \u2026 to the populace at large\u201d. This design by the Republican-led Texas legislature represented a purposeful effort to evade federal court scrutiny. While abortion was the constitutional right at issue, debate focused on the legality of the structure of Texas\u2019s law, rather than the right to abortion. The court heard two separate challenges to the Texas law during oral arguments. Three liberal justices had already said they believed the law was unconstitutional. A fourth, the conservative Roberts, had said in the past he would have blocked the law while lower courts considered it. And two more justices, conservatives Amy Coney-Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, who both joined the bench during the Trump administration, had critical questions for attorneys representing Texas\u2019s case. In separate suits, the Biden administration and abortion providers asked the court to block the law, claiming it is incompatible with Roe v Wade, caused ongoing and immediate harm to people in Texas seeking abortions, and was designed to evade court scrutiny in a way that threatened other constitutional rights. Attorneys for Texas argued abortion providers\u2019 conflict was with Congress, and blocking courts from accepting lawsuits related to the law, known as SB8, threatened the US system of government. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find that relief, because Texas designed the law specifically to thwart it,\u201d said the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar. \u201cThe clear purpose and actual effect [of the law] has been to chill the right\u201d to abortion. Marc Hearron, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, representing abortion providers in Texas, argued the court should enjoin Texas court clerks from docketing cases, arguing the threat of litigation was the very point of SB8. \u201cThis is a unique law created because the state has delegated enforcement and taken away the normal executive officials who would enforce, and has weaponized the court system,\u201d Hearron said. SB8 is structured to favor plaintiffs in several ways. It provides plaintiffs a $10,000 fine for violations, plus attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants, such as abortion providers, are not eligible for any such fees if a case is found to be frivolous. It also allows plaintiffs to sue in any county in Texas, which could force defendants into far-flung courts, and for multiple suits to be brought for the same alleged violation. Furthermore, it allows anyone to sue, not just people who might be somehow hurt by the abortion. Hearron argued this made anyone involved in providing abortions a \u201cpermanent defendant\u201d. Later, he added: \u201cThe state has made the clerks an essential role in this machinery they have made.\u201d Coney Barrett, who appeared skeptical of the enforcement mechanism, asked the Texas solicitor general, Judd E Stone II, whether abortion providers would need to bar citizens from suing one-by-one. \u201cYou cannot get global relief,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cIt\u2019s on an individual by individual basis.\u201d Stone responded that Barrett was effectively correct: each individual citizen would need to be enjoined from enforcing the law. Justices then asked whether the attorney general of Texas could be enjoined, and thus block further lawsuits from being filed, on the basis that citizens were acting as private attorneys general. Stone said no. \u201cHe has none of those sort of mechanisms whatsoever,\u201d said Stone, and added the state had \u201cno authority\u201d to stop private citizens\u2019 suits. Another conservative on the bench, Brett Kavanaugh, said the Texas law \u201cexploited\u201d a loophole in court precedent concerning when state officials can be barred from enforcing unconstitutional laws. He wondered if the court should \u201cclose that loophole\u201d. Elena Kagan, a liberal justice, sarcastically said the law was written by \u201csome geniuses\u201d to evade the broad legal principle that \u201cstates are not to nullify federal constitutional rights\u201d. She argued that if Texas\u2019s argument prevailed, states would be invited to nullify other rights in the same way. \u201cGuns, same-sex marriage, religious rights, whatever you don\u2019t like: go ahead.\u201d Only two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, appeared moved by Texas\u2019s arguments. Gorsuch suggested attorneys for reproductive rights groups were \u201cline drawing\u201d between the Texas law and others laws which constrain constitutional rights. The hearing came a month before arguably the most important abortion rights case in five decades: Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. In that case, the court will consider whether Mississippi can ban nearly all abortion after 15 weeks, roughly nine weeks earlier than Roe v Wade permits. Both the court\u2019s decision not to block Texas\u2019s law and its acceptance of the Dobbs case are viewed as an ominous signs for the future of legal abortion in the US.

{"title": "Kate Barazetti obituary", "article": "Kate Barazetti, who has died aged 79, was a great humanitarian whose gift for friendship and hospitality spanned generational and social divides. A champion of race, gender and class equality, Kate really lived her beliefs by sharing her life with the most diverse group of individuals I have ever been part of. She was staunchly loyal to those she loved, caring and supportive. Her parents, Anna (nee Strassberger) and Bill Barazetti, had met as anti-Nazi activists in 1930s Germany, and Kate was the second of four children. Bill was later honoured for the role he played alongside Nicholas Winton in the evacuation of Jewish children from Prague. After many brushes with violence and death, the family ended up in Britain, and Kate was born in Stevenage railway station during a bombing raid. Bill got a job working nights at a printing press, and later with the trade union organisation PSI, but by all accounts family life continued in a chaotic and frightening way, until Anna kicked Kate out, aged 16, for being \u201crebellious\u201d. Kate then moved to Israel with Mitch Burke \u2013 later her husband, and father to her children, Debbie and Jeremy. Her first job was at an Israeli bank, which gave her the book-keeping skills she used for much of her working life, enabling her to contribute to enterprises she supported, such as the Africa Centre in London, International PEN, City Limits magazine and Space Studios. After three years, Kate and Mitch returned to the UK. The marriage did not last, and Kate and the kids ended up living in a caravan in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Bill came to the rescue, inviting them to move into his work flat in St John\u2019s Wood \u2013 he and Anna were by then living in Hornchurch, Essex. From this base, Kate began life as a London single parent, working multiple jobs. She forged a friendship with Robin Jones, a neighbour, and they finally became a couple in 1983. I met her in 1985, when I joined City Limits magazine as receptionist and she was working in the accounts department. She was fearless, forthright and funny, always finding ways to play the system and fight for the rights of those excluded or badly served by it. We hit it off instantly and, two years later, when I needed a temporary home for myself and my daughter Ava, she and Robin took us in. Kate and Robin threw the best parties: their Tuesday night dinners, monthly poker nights, summer and Xmas celebrations were legendary. They were the most generous and laidback hosts, always interested and entertained by their guests\u2019 stories and observations on life. Great supporters of the arts, they filled their home with original works by artists who often became friends. In the 1990s Kate finally completed her education by doing a degree and master\u2019s in gender studies at what is now Birkbeck, University of London. She went on to set up the feminist news website Aviva from her front room. Later she found her metier as a teacher, first of English to newly arrived refugees and then working on access to social science courses. She continued in this field well into her 70s. Robin died in 2020. Kate is survived by her children and four grandchildren, Ben, Josh, Jared and Kizzi, and two of her siblings, Nick and Annie.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/nov/01/kate-barazetti-obituary", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:06:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},

At the turn of the millennium, with the business of swiping right and left still some years ahead, Paul put his future happiness in the hands of the Guardian\u2019s telephone dating line, through which he met his wife Ruth Webb, a distinguished classicist, for whom he was happy to abandon what Mrs Patrick Campbell called \u201cthe hurly-burly of the chaise-longue\u201d. Not that the \u201churly-burly\u201d didn\u2019t provide rich material for his writing, and he later recounted his experiences in Date Expectations (2005). I used to look forward to weekly emails chronicling some of these encounters: \u201cYou like a laugh, you\u2019ll love Sally,\u201d Paul was told, \u201cShe\u2019s a riot.\u201d \u201cYes, of the kind you want to quell with water cannon.\u201d Paul and Ruth married and in 2002 their daughter Rachel was born, bringing late joy to Paul\u2019s parents, Lev, a journalist in Warsaw, and Janka, Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivors who had met at a displaced persons camp in Rome after the second world war and later settled in London, where Paul, their only son, was born. Paul went to Christ\u2019s college, Finchley, and graduated in psychology from Manchester University, before starting out as a reporter on the Wrexham Leader, then working at Radio Hallam in Sheffield, where I met him 43 years ago, and at LBC in London, in the pioneering days of commercial radio. His work as a television reporter and producer included a stint on TV-AM, the first commercial TV breakfast show, which launched in 1983 and where he did many of the funnies, basically as head of dressing up and delivering what he invariably called \u2018\u201cspooky looks to camera\u201d. Then came his career as a successful writer of funny and smart novels \u2013 Paul\u2019s latest two books, Happiness for Humans (2018) and Ask Me Anything (2020), have been sold for film and TV. His association with the Guardian did not end with his marriage. Paul shared many of the paper\u2019s values, but he also loved a joke, and took childish delight when he got a funny printed on the letters page. He would cut it out and pass it round to dining companions, of whom there was never any shortage, in his favourite Chinese restaurant in Soho. He was a best friend to me and countless others \u2013 warm, witty and generous with help and advice \u2013 which is why there was a constant stream of us into his flat in his final days. He began to show symptoms of mental and physical decline in April this year, and was diagnosed with suspected CJD. Paul was cared for by Ruth and Rachel, with extraordinary love and patience, as he became less and less responsive. He would have appreciated the irony in one of his favourite Woody Allen quotes: \u2018I don\u2019t mind dying, I just don\u2019t want to be there when it happens,\u201d because in many ways he wasn\u2019t.

Today to be on the worse end of the conditions, to show the character we did as a side, one of our bowlers getting injured, guys having to step up and bowl overs at tough times \u2013 I think what that will do for us as a side is fantastic.\u201d Tymal Mills pulled up with a right quad injury midway through his second over, forcing England to hurriedly rewrite their bowling plans. But it was a night for overcoming adversity, with Buttler and Eoin Morgan scoring freely in the latter stages of England\u2019s innings after they reached the halfway point on 47 for three. \u201cThe way we were finding the wicket, we were saying 120 might be a good score to keep us in the game,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cObviously that would have been well short with the way conditions changed. But I think sometimes when you set your sights a little bit lower, it allows you to stay calmer. The depth we have in the team allows you to play with freedom at the same time.\u201d Morgan\u2019s 40 off 36 balls, accelerating after a slow start, was his highest score for 13 innings going back more than a year. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of everything we\u2019ve done tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys had to fight unbelievably hard.

{"title": "Scott Morrison tells Cop26 Australia will exceed 2030 target in bid to fend off criticism", "article": "Scott Morrison has used his national statement at the Cop26 to emphasise that Australia will probably overachieve on its 2030 emissions reduction target in an effort to blunt international criticism about his government\u2019s lack of climate ambition. While the lead-up to the Glasgow summit was dominated by Morrison\u2019s negotiations with the National party to land a net zero commitment by 2050, the UN-led event is focused on ambition for the 2030s. Australia \u2013 part of a bloc of big emitters and exporters at last weekend\u2019s G20 summit in Rome attempting to water down commitments in the final communique to phase out coal \u2013 has been criticised for not increasing its ambition in the critical decade.\nMorrison used his set-piece address to the Glasgow conference to tell his peers that Australia had submitted a new nationally determined contribution, noting that Australia\u2019s emissions would \u201cfall by 35% by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment\u201d. For 2030, the new NDC says: \u201cAustralia reaffirms its ambitious economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030, and will exceed it by up to 9 percentage points\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s emissions projections 2021 demonstrate that we are on track to reduce emissions by up to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030,\u201d it says. The updated NDC also said Australia would adopt an economy-wide target of net zero emissions by 2050 \u201ccovering all sectors and gases included in Australia\u2019s national inventory\u201d. In the lead-up to Cop26, under pressure from key allies, including the summit host, Boris Johnson \u2013 Morrison attempted to increase Australia\u2019s Abbott-era 2030 target to something more in line with the updated projections, which say a 35% reduction is possible. But that effort was vetoed by the National party. The agreement to adopt net zero also went down to the wire. While a number of leaders used their opening contributions to the Glasgow summit to issue stark warnings about the existential risks associated with failing to mitigate the risks of runaway global heating, Morrison struck an upbeat note.\nIn statements to the conference on Monday, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said optimistic assessments of progress on tackling the climate crisis were \u201can illusion\u201d while the British prime minister likened the current position of the world to a scenario in a James Bond film. Boris Johnson said a common plot device in the spy thrillers was 007 \u201cstrapped to a doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it. \u201cAnd we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today, except that the tragedy is that this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.\u201d But Morrison declared there was \u201ccause for optimism\u201d. Australia\u2019s prime minister told leaders 18 months ago the world was \u201cstaring into the abyss of a one in one hundred years pandemic\u201d. \u201cThe vaccines we would need had not only not been invented, but there had never been a vaccine for a coronavirus,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut here we are. Billions vaccinated and the world is reclaiming what Covid has taken from us. \u201cThe challenge of combating climate change will be met in the same way, and it will be met by those who are largely not in this room. \u201cIt will be our scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, industrialists and financiers that will chart this path to net zero \u2013 and it is up to us as leaders to back them in.\u201d Morrison\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said Australia\u2019s technology-based approach and refusal to do more by 2030 had been \u201creceived badly\u201d internationally. Speaking from Glasgow, Turnbull said the goal of the conference was to increase 2030 commitments and that Morrison had not done that was \u201ca very big disappointment\u201d . He said Morrison should not expect credit for claiming a projection that Australia would do more to cut emissions by 2030 but not formally committing to do it. \u201cProjections do not provide any commitment or determination\u2026 a projection is just a guess,\u201d Turnbull told the ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to face up to the fact that we\u2019ve got to stop burning coal and gas, we\u2019ve got to stop burning fossil fuels. The proposition that seems to be fashionable in some quarters here that we can keep on burning coal, and in indeed exporting coal, and that somehow is consistent with getting to net zero by 2050, is nonsense. The reality is if we keep burning fossil fuels we will fry the planet.\u201d Hopes that the Glasgow summit will yield more ambitious pledges have been dampened by the failure of G20 countries to reach a consensus on key commitments in Rome last weekend. The Rome summit \u2013 staged as a precursor event for Glasgow \u2013 wound up with a communique that did not include a firm commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and had only a vague commitment to \u201cphasing out investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity \u2026 as soon as possible\u201d. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is not attending the Glasgow conference. In a written statement to the Cop, China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest emitter \u2013 called on developed countries to \u201cprovide support to help developing countries do better\u201d.\nAccording to a text of his statement published by the Xinhua news agency, the Chinese president stressed the responsibility of developed countries in tackling climate change, saying that they should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better. China has not made any new significant commitments. India has now pledged to meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, unveiled five pledges on Monday. The country will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 and get half of its energy from renewable resources by the same date. Modi said India would reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030, and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%. The US president, Joe Biden, told the conference the world only had a limited window to deal with the climate crisis. He said his country was\u201cback at the table\u201d of international climate action, and intended to lead by example. Biden\u2019s decision to return the US to the Paris agreement spurred a round of ambitious climate pledges from other world leaders earlier in 2021. But he is struggling to secure legislative approval for his policy agenda at home.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/02/scott-morrison-tells-cop26-australia-will-exceed-2030-target-in-bid-to-fend-off-criticism", "last_update": "2021-11-02T01:36:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Squeeze on UK incomes to last until late 2023, says OBR", "article": "British households will remain worse off than before the pandemic until 2023 as rising inflation hits living standards, the Treasury\u2019s economics watchdog has warned as Rishi Sunak sought to defend his budget. Charlie Bean, a former Bank of England deputy governor and board member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said that growth in household incomes, after taking account of inflation, would effectively stall over the next two years.\nAnswering questions from MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have real household disposable income getting above pre-pandemic levels until the back end of 2023, and it\u2019s growing at a pretty mediocre rate from then on.\u201d The OBR issued forecasts alongside last week\u2019s budget showing that inflation would weigh down household incomes over the next two years, before rising by just 1.3% a year on average by the middle of the decade. Sunak later told the MPs on the committee that he was taking action to protect low-paid workers amid the living standards squeeze. However, he admitted it would take time to have an impact on real-terms wages. \u201cIs it going to happen overnight? Of course these things don\u2019t happen overnight. But we\u2019re putting in place all the things that are required for there to be better wage increases for people over time,\u201d he said. The chancellor said raising the national living wage, cutting the universal credit taper rate, and investing in training and education schemes and other public services would help those on low incomes. He also said his \u201cgoal, my mission\u201d was to bring down tax from the highest levels since the 1950s. \u201cFor those on the lowest incomes for whom these things make the most difference, actually next year \u2013 because of the increase in the national living wage, [and] if they\u2019re on universal credit, they\u2019ll benefit from the taper rate \u2013 they\u2019ll have significantly more cash in their pockets.\u201d Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that Britain was set for the worst wage squeeze in modern history, with the average worker on course to be \u00a313,000 a year worse off by the middle 2020s than they would have been if wages had risen at pre-2008 financial crisis rates. Despite the unprecedented squeeze, Sunak insisted that breaking two Conservative manifesto pledges \u2013 raising national insurance and pausing the pensions triple lock \u2013 was justified. \u201cI genuinely believe it was the right and fair thing to do,\u201d he told MPs, saying that high levels of government borrowing and debt incurred during the pandemic needed tackling to provide \u201cfiscal space\u201d to protect against future shocks. Pointing out that pensions were at the highest level relative to earnings from work in the past 30 years, he said applying the triple lock would have meant finding \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d in savings elsewhere. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was fair,\u201d he said.\nThe state pension will rise by 3.1% from next April, rather than by more than 8% if they had risen in-line with average earnings before that element of the triple lock was suspended. Sunak also defended cutting a surcharge on banking industry profits, a step that will cost the exchequer as much as \u00a34bn over five years. He argued banks would still pay more tax because corporation tax was rising from 19% to 25% by 2023. The banking industry corporation tax surcharge is reducing from 8% to 3%. This means the combined tax rate for banks will rise from 27% to 28%, although it could have risen as high as 33% if the surcharge was maintained.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/squeeze-on-uk-incomes-to-last-until-late-2023-says-obr", "last_update": "2021-11-01T20:04:34Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Peter Watson-Wood obituary", "article": "My father-in-law, Peter Watson-Wood, who has died aged 92, was known for many things \u2013 notably as a photographer, film-maker, producer and all-round entrepreneur. Born to Molly (nee Payton) and Dougie Watson-Wood, a journalist, in Sutton, Surrey, at the age of eight Peter contracted meningitis. Not expected to live through the night, he was kept awake and alive by Molly reading to him \u2013 instilling an undying love of stories. He escaped death again in the kitchen Morrison shelter when a small bomb penetrated the roof during the Battle of Britain and landed on his bed. It threatened to blow up the house but not before Dougie heaved it out of the upstairs window. In 1946, after leaving Sutton high school for boys, Peter was drafted into the RAF and was chosen for the bomb disposal force \u2013 digging his way across Britain in search of live bombs. His working life began as a counter clerk at the labour exchange in Ealing, however he soon got a job at an advertising agency, John Mitchell & Partners, as an account manager. In 1952 Peter had front-row seats to King George VI\u2019s funeral as the procession passed the agency window. Through a friendship with the actor and entertainer Tony Newley, Peter\u2019s circle included stars of the silver screen, such as Peter Sellers and Diana Dors. Visiting Penzance in 1956, Peter met the \u2018\u201csmudger\u201d (tourist photographer) Mike Courtney, and joined him in business. They erected the now famous Land\u2019s End signpost - charging tourists to have their pictures taken \u2013 and expanded to John O\u2019Groats and Aberdeen Beach. Peter moved to Cornwall permanently in 1959, and by the late 1960s was working as a local news cameraman. When the Torrey Canyon disaster struck in 1967, he managed to secure exclusive footage of the prime minister, Harold Wilson, viewing the stricken tanker; ITN picked up his story for the 6 O\u2019Clock News and henceforth commissioned him to make television documentaries. For three decades he filmed far and wide. From meditating with the Beatles in India in 1967, he travelled to New Guinea for a series called The World About Us (1973) and defied the land speed record at Black Rock Desert for a BBC film on the Thrust 2, For Britain and the Hell of It (1987). Through his work he also befriended many of the St Ives painters, such as Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton and Barbara Hepworth. In the 90s, Peter turned to producing feature films, among them Mad Dogs and Englishmen (1995), starring Elizabeth Hurley, Tales of the Riverbank (2008), featuring the voices of Jim Broadbent and Steve Coogan, and, finally, The Wicker Tree (2011), a sequel to the 1973 cult Scottish horror film The Wicker Man. Refusing retirement, Peter created paintings and wrote poetry and two autobiographies. A marriage to Wilma Smith in 1958 ended in divorce. Peter is survived by his second wife, Annie (nee Howard), whom he married in 1987, his sons, Gary, from his first marriage, and Christopher, from his second, two stepchildren, Michael and Katie, and eight grandchildren.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/01/peter-watson-wood-obituary", "last_update": "2021-11-01T20:02:06Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Victory over Tonga this weekend will give the players at least \u00a323,000 in match fees while, in contrast, the Pacific Islanders earn just \u00a3500 a week. Last September the England players agreed a 25% pay cut for one season due to the financial impact of the pandemic on the union but a new more performance-related agreement has been reached. The minimum the players will make is less than the pre-pandemic match fee of around \u00a323,000 but victory in matches against Tonga, Australia and South Africa would activate a bonus clause, meaning the squad collecting a similar amount. In addition, the players may earn even more if the RFU\u2019s commercial performance exceeds forecasts.\nEngland players are the best paid in the world \u2013 even factoring in last season\u2019s cut \u2013 which is further highlighted by comparisons with this weekend\u2019s opponents. The RFU is, however, making a six-figure donation to the Tonga union as a goodwill gesture, as was the case when Samoa came to Twickenham in 2017. \u201cPlayer fees for future games have been re-negotiated to include an increased bonus component based on performance,\u201d read an RFU statement. \u201cUnderpinning this is a revenue share agreement with the RFU. If the players perform well on the pitch, they will earn the same as the previous deal and if the RFU commercial performance exceeds projected forecasts then the players will share in this upside. The RFU greatly appreciates the strong cooperation and support from players, the RPA and the players\u2019 agents throughout the pandemic.\u201d The RFU has also announced closer longer-term links with the Tongan union, which include measures such as providing support staff for the Pacific Islanders this autumn and an ambition for England pathway coaches to spend time working in Tonga. On the eve of England\u2019s World Cup pool stage victory over Tonga in 2019, the then attack coach Scott Wisemantel urged the RFU to consider touring the Pacific Islands. The Tonga chief executive, Peter Harding, appeared to accept that was unlikely to happen, however, when welcoming the closer alliance with the RFU. He said: \u201cWe understand and accept World Rugby rules, commercial realities make it a challenge to host England. However, innovative partnerships like the one we have developed with the RFU will assist to stabilise the [Tonga union] and assist us to make the game more inclusive to women and children; to deliver a strong talent pathway while working towards representation at World Rugby.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/england-players-to-bank-70000-each-for-winning-all-three-autumn-tests", "last_update": "2021-11-01T21:10:51Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Scott Morrison used his opening address to emphasise that Australia will probably over-achieve on its 2030 emissions reduction target as he attempted to blunt international criticism about his government\u2019s lack of ambition.

Morrison has declared he will not \u201ccop sledging\u201d about Australia\u2019s integrity after accusations from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that Morrison lied to him over an abandoned $90bn submarine contract. Morrison said he was as transparent as possible with the French president, but did not disclose information about the Aukus deal as it was too confidential.

{"title": "Brian Colston obituary", "article": "My friend Brian Colston, who has died aged 99, was one of a generation of pioneering GPs who helped to transform primary health care in Britain. Over more than 40 years he developed a range of innovative services of national significance in Birmingham\u2019s inner city. Working out of small, cramped premises on the Lee Bank estate, Brian led the development of preventive health care in the city. His innovative work included dedicated asthma and diabetes clinics; contraceptive advice and family planning services; attached social worker schemes; and a day hostel for the city centre homeless and people with addictions. The practice also established one of the first patient association groups in the country. Born in Bristol to Margaret (nee Moore), a teacher, and Edward Colston, an undertaker, Brian attended Bristol grammar school. He spent the second world war in the Royal Signals serving in east Asia. Then the Forces Education Scheme enabled him to study medicine at the University of Bristol. There he met Enid Furnival, whom he married in 1951. After he qualified as a doctor in 1956 they moved to Birmingham, where Brian spent the whole of his professional life. After many years in the practice, Brian secured funding for a new purpose-built health centre on Lee Bank, which opened in 1985, embracing the comprehensive range of services that he saw as the core of his vision of good primary health care. He was also actively involved with Birmingham health authority and the Medical Practitioners\u2019 Union and played a key role in setting up a GP-led maternity ward to assist safer maternity care. He was also involved in the establishment of the Birmingham pregnancy advisory service, which, in 1968, became the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, at a time when \u2013 despite the passing of the 1967 Abortion Act \u2013 safe, legal abortions were still difficult for many women to access. As a mark of his many achievements, in 1989 he was appointed OBE. After retiring in 1991 he moved to Devon to enjoy his passion for sailing, as well as gardening and photography, before returning to Birmingham with Enid to spend his last years. He was a thoughtful, kind and generous man who dedicated his life to the health and wellbeing of the people of inner-city Birmingham. Brian is survived by Enid, their three children, Lucy, Simon and Nicola, and six grandchildren. His eldest son, Tim, died in 2014.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/01/brian-colston-obituary", "last_update": "2021-11-01T19:50:55Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Does Salisbury train crash point to wider problems on the network?", "article": "Rail accident inspectors have said it is too early to release indications of what caused the collision between two trains at Salisbury on Sunday evening. But by now CCTV and data logs from signals and trains are likely to have given them a strong idea of what led the Great Western and South Western Railway services to crash into each other. That might prove to be a fault with the signal; or that a train passed a red light; that the brakes failed; or even that the brakes worked but the wheels slid, in the season when leaves on the line can make the rails treacherous. Whatever the cause turns out to be, the next phase of investigation will work out the deeper underlying reasons \u2013 and then address those factors, whether they be human, technical or systemic. This, the UK rail industry believes, is what it does extremely well \u2013 to the point where it could justly proclaim itself the safest railway in Europe during the last decade. Nonetheless, the blemishes on the record have been appearing with concerning regularity in recent years. Until 2020, the 2007 derailment in Grayrigg was the last time a passenger died in a UK train crash \u2013 a huge turnaround after a succession of terrible accidents in the days of Railtrack around the millennium. Last year, though, came the tragedy at Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, when a landslip caused a Scotrail service to come off the tracks, causing three people onboard to lose their lives. But this weekend\u2019s accident in Salisbury marked the first significant collision between two moving trains in passenger service since the terrible events of Ladbroke Grove, London in 1999. Throw in a succession of derailments, and trains hitting the buffers in London and Liverpool in recent months, and it might feel pertinent to ask if this is more than just a run of bad luck. In the context of what went before, Network Rail, safety remains extraordinarily good \u2013 certainly compared with other forms of transport. Modelling from the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) showed that a passenger would take on more than 20 times the risk of fatality travelling the same distance in a car than on a train. And while incidents have mounted \u2013 until the 2020 lockdown, there was an alarming resurgence in the number of Spads, or signals passed at danger, the acronym that became familiar after the Ladbroke Grove inquests \u2013 the industry argues that ever fewer have fatal consequences. That hasn\u2019t proved entirely true: deaths of rail workers rose from zero in 2016 to five in 2021. And accident inspectors criticised Network Rail for long-term safety failings that led to the deaths of two track workers in south Wales in 2019. But a safety taskforce since then has led to a shift in policy that will completely eliminate \u201clookout working\u201d, when people conduct repairs on a track where trains are still running. Meanwhile, extreme weather has made upkeep of the track an ever more difficult task \u2013 as disruption on both main lines from London to Scotland this weekend underlined. The railway has increased its spending on resilience, a task whose critical importance was underlined by Stonehaven, but climate change is likely to elevate the budget. Reports of objects on the line are also monitored by the RSSB \u2013 and incidents of trees and wires falling on the tracks in high winds and storms have become more frequent. Managing all these is where the rail industry believes the trends remain generally positive. According to the RSSB, collisions between trains have been recorded at two to three a year over the last five years. Although one driver has been seriously injured, to escape fatalities in the worst such collision this century is a record few would have expected 20 years ago. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2021 to make clear that the Salisbury accident was the first significant collision between moving trains in passenger service since the Ladbroke Grove crash.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/does-salisbury-train-crash-point-to-wider-problems-on-the-network", "last_update": "2021-11-02T12:04:02Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Wolf Blitzer, a news anchor with CNN, wrote on Twitter that he was reporting from Edinburgh in Scotland, \u201cwhere 20,000 world leaders and delegates have gathered for the Cop26\u201d.\nHis tweet was roundly mocked, given that the Cop26 conference was actually being held in Glasgow, more than an hour\u2019s drive from the CNN base in the centre of Edinburgh. Byline Times\u2019s chief Westminster correspondent, Adam Bienkov, replied with a map of Scotland, while Specsavers got in on the act, telling Blitzer that he \u201cshould\u2019ve gone to Glasgow\u201d. A parody Boris Johnson account quipped: \u201cYou seem to have all the necessary attributes to become my next Foreign Secretary.\u201d Rumours have swirled around the conference that a mix-up at the White House left several American media teams based miles away from Glasgow. The Guardian has contacted the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association for a response. But it wasn\u2019t the only example of American journalists getting confused about the geography of Scotland in the opening days of the global climate summit.

Edinburgh airport\u2019s social media team saw the funny side, replying: \u201cJeff, you have no idea what you\u2019ve done \u2026 Welcome to Edinburgh, and Scotland!\u201d The Reuters reporter did correct himself just minutes later though, writing: \u201cCorrection: arrived in Edinburgh. The president is motorcading now to Glasgow.\u201d Meanwhile, Channel 4 News\u2019s Krishnan Guru-Murthy rubbed salt in the wounds by airing his displeasure at his American colleagues\u2019 pronunciation of Glasgow.

But what they do for the people of tomorrow \u2013 that is statesmanship. \u201cI, for one, hope that this conference will be one of those rare occasions where everyone will have the chance to rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit \u2013 written in history books yet to be printed \u2013 will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations. That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action.\u201d\nIn her message, recorded after she announced she would be unable to attend the conference due to medical advice to rest, she added: \u201cOf course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live for ever. But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children\u2019s children, and those who will follow in their footsteps.\u201d The world has \u201cthe chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend\u201d, she said. \u201cNone of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope. Working side by side, we have the ability to solve the most insurmountable problems and to triumph over the greatest of adversities.\u201d\nThe \u201cimpact of the environment on human progress\u201d, was a subject close to Philip\u2019s heart, she said, and it was a \u201csource of great pride\u201d to her that the role he played in encouraging people to protect \u201cour fragile planet\u201d lived on through the work of Prince Charles and Prince William.

{"title": "Scott Morrison unveils $500m in international climate finance on first day of Cop26", "article": "The Morrison government has unveiled an additional $500m for international climate finance on the first day of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. But Australia\u2019s prime minister says the funding will be directed to projects in the Indo-Pacific rather than distributed through the green climate fund.\nAfter visiting a Glasgow shipyard early on Monday to return fire in an escalating diplomatic row with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Scott Morrison joined the Cop26 and met Pacific leaders on the opening day of the summit. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, characterised Australia\u2019s new commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 as \u201ca start\u201d. But he said he wanted a concrete plan for Australia \u201cto halve emissions by 2030\u201d. The Fijian prime minister presented Morrison with a copy of his country\u2019s Climate Change Act \u201cas a guide\u201d.\nBefore the Cop26 climate summit, Pacific leaders warned Morrison they face existential peril because of global heating, which contributes to rising sea levels, exposing island nations to the risk of inundation. In the lead-up to Glasgow, Pacific countries lobbied Morrison to boost Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction target. Morrison acknowledged on Monday there was \u201cno greater threat to our Pacific family than climate change\u201d. But he said Australia would pursue international financing to combat the climate crisis on its own terms. \u201cWe are not putting this [funding] through other worldwide institutions, other groups like this,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Glasgow. \u201cWe are doing this direct. We want to make sure that the climate finance investments that Australians are making are invested in our back yard, among our Pacific Island family and among our south-east Asian partners and friends. \u201cWe want to cut out all the red tape and get rid of all the bureaucracy and make sure that this funding is going to work directly within the region, making a big difference for their resilience and their mitigation to ensure they can deal, not just with trying to reduce their own emissions, but more significantly, being able to deal with the consequences of climate change which they are already experiencing in their many Pacific Island nations.\u201d The green climate fund was set up through the UN\u2019s climate convention to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. But Morrison pulled Australia out of the fund in 2018 during an interview with the radio broadcaster Alan Jones. Subsequently, Australia has funded projects in the Pacific region, and the prime minister pledged a further $500m on Monday. Morrison said the money would be directed to Pacific and south-east Asian countries to enhance climate resilience for future infrastructure investments, including roads, schools and bridges. On the sidelines of the conference, Australia also signed an agreement with Fiji to develop a carbon market.\nFiji has become the first country to join the Morrison government\u2019s proposed Indo-Pacific carbon offsets scheme. Under the Morrison government\u2019s roadmap to achieve net zero emissions, nearly half the abatement to be undertaken between now and 2050 will be delivered by \u201cglobal technology trends\u201d, \u201cfurther technology breakthroughs\u201d and through international and domestic offsets. Australia\u2019s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said Australia\u2019s commitment to achieve net zero involved purchasing abatement through offsets. \u201cWe are putting in place the building blocks to enable that to occur,\u201d Taylor said.

Joe Biden\u2019s $1.75tn Build Back Better plan \u201cis spread over a decade and paid for through raising revenues, not taxing working families \u2026 but in part thanks to this [OECD] tax deal by asking companies to pay more, by corporations that are very profitable and can afford to contribute revenues\u201d. She said the US \u201cneeded to invest in people\u201d, particularly in education, infrastructure and broadband, telling an event in Dublin that America\u2019s roads and bridges are falling down, and that the lack of broadband access had also hit many families hard during the pandemic. Some were forced to \u201cdrive to a parking lot outside McDonald\u2019s for their kids to be able to do their homework and have access to the internet,\u201d she said. She said: \u201cI am proud of the new international tax deal, because it not only provides benefits for everyday families, it will also stabilize the century-old international tax system.\u201d Yellen used the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin to heap praise on Ireland \u2013 an implicit thanks for eventually buckling under pressure from the US to raise its 12.5% corporation tax rate and join the 15% OECD rate. She added: \u201cImportantly, the deal ends the chaotic array of digital services taxes that have discriminated against Irish and US companies.\u201d Ireland\u2019s economy relies heavily on US companies. Sources recently claimed in interviews with the Guardian that Microsoft, Apple and Pfizer are responsible for 30% of the country\u2019s entire corporation tax take \u2013 the equivalent of about \u20ac4bn. Although those three companies are heavily invested in the country, and in Pfizer\u2019s case a substantial manufacturing base, they now face paying additional taxes at home as part of the new global tax regime. Tax avoidance schemes such as the so-called double Irish Dutch sandwich that allowed companies like Google to funnel their huge revenues from Europe through Ireland and on to offshore zero-tax havens in the Caribbean, are now outlawed. Yellen on Monday said Ireland will remain one of the best places in the world for multinational companies to invest in, even after Dublin gave up its prized 12.5% rate. She said while some viewed Ireland as a tax haven, \u201cperception often lags behind reality\u201d and that Ireland was \u201calready winning this new race to the top, with its robust business environment\u201d. Yellen said: \u201cHere is my honest assessment of what it will not do: it won\u2019t change this country\u2019s status as one of the best places to do business in the world.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/us-firms-multinationals-tax-rate-janet-yellen", "last_update": "2021-11-01T19:55:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018We are digging our own graves\u2019: world leaders\u2019 powerful words at Cop26", "article": "Alarm, anger and a few significant promises featured during speeches made by dozens of world leaders as crucial UN climate talks came to life in a cold and wet Glasgow on Monday. The tone was set by Boris Johnson, who opened the Cop26 talks with a stark warning that \u201cthe anger and impatience of the world will be uncontainable\u201d if the talks fail to get the world on track to avoid disastrous global heating of more than 1.5C.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, noted governments\u2019 lack of progress in cutting planet-heating emissions. There were some significant announcements, too, such as Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, promising that his country would get to net zero emissions by 2070 and Johnson unveiling new climate aid for vulnerable developing countries. But overall, the tenor was of impatience and occasional frustration.\nMia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados I ask to you: what must we say to our people, living on the frontline in the Caribbean, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Pacific, when both ambition and, regrettably, some of the needed faces at Glasgow, are not present? What excuse should we give for the failure? \u201cWhen will leaders lead? Our people are watching, and our people are taking note.

Let the change be a real one, let the paradigm shift happen. May those who exploit without thinking of tomorrow stop. May we realise that in this battle to save our planet, we are in the same boat \u2013 big, small, rich or poor. The time to act is yesterday.\u201d Lazarus Chakwera, president of Malawi The money pledged to the least developed nations by developed nations is not a donation, but a cleaning fee. Neither Africa in general, nor Malawi in particular, will take no for an answer. Not any more.\u201d Boris Johnson, UK prime minister The worse it gets, the higher the price when we are eventually forced by catastrophe to act, because humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change. It\u2019s one minute to midnight on that Doomsday Clock and we need to act now.\u201d Joe Biden, US president There\u2019s no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves. This is a challenge of our collective lifetimes. The existential threat, threat to human existence as we know it, and every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases. So let this be the moment that we answer history\u2019s call here in Glasgow.\u201d Narendra Modi, Indian prime minister By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero emissions \u2026 Today, the entire world acknowledges that India is the only big economy in the world that has delivered in both letter and spirit on its Paris commitments.\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general Recent climate action announcements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around. This is an illusion. \u201cOur addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink. We face a stark choice: either we stop it, or it stops us. It\u2019s time to say, \u2018Enough \u2026 Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.\u2019\u201d David Attenborough, naturalist and TV presenter If, working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely, working together, we are powerful enough to save it. In my lifetime, I have witnessed a terrible decline. In yours, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery. That desperate hope, ladies and gentlemen, delegates, excellencies, is why the world is looking to you \u2013 and why you are here.\u201d Emmanuel Macron, French president It is often those who can\u2019t access the models of development that caused this climate change that are living through its first consequences. Small islands, vulnerable territories, indigenous people are the first victims of the consequences of climate disturbances.\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission I know that all of us here at Cop26 want to be on the right side of history. And this is why I call on all of us to do whatever it takes, now, to limit global warming to 1.5C. And we can do it. Because climate change is man-made, science tells us. So we can do something about it. It\u2019s our opportunity to write history. Even more, it\u2019s our duty to act now.\u201d George Weah, president of Liberia Although we bear the brunt of the impact of climate change, we benefit the least from existing solutions and financial arrangements currently in place for tackling climate change.

She was then reported missing and there was no sign of her in her flat. Her naked body was discovered three weeks later in a water-filled dyke at St Mary in the Marsh in Kent on 15 December 1987. There were reports of \u201cprowler activity\u201d in the lead-up to both their deaths, with local women reporting a voyeur looking through their windows, said the prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC. Fuller, an electrician, was arrested on suspicion of murder on 3 December 2020 following new analysis of decades-old DNA evidence. Officers searched his home, finding images of dead women at the two hospital mortuaries being abused by Fuller, the court heard. Four hard drives attached to the back of a cupboard \u201cwere found to contain a library of unimaginable sexual depravity\u201d, said Atkinson. \u201cThere were both photographs and videos which showed the defendant sexually abusing female corpses in the mortuaries of the two hospitals at which he worked, first the Kent and Sussex hospital, where he worked full-time from 1989, and then the Tunbridge Wells hospital, to which he moved in 2010.\u201d In a police interview, Fuller admitted to using Facebook to search for photos of the people he abused in the mortuary, the court heard. \u201cHe admitted to searching for them on the internet, including on Facebook,\u201d said Atkinson. \u201cHe claimed that this would be after the offending, rather than research before offending.\u201d Fuller would later go back and name the files containing images of his offending against dead people using the ledgers from the mortuary and identification tags on the bodies, the court heard. The prosecutor said these images provided evidence that Fuller committed the acts out of \u201csexual gratification\u201d and not mental illness. \u201cIt shows the defendant derived sexual gratification from sexual activity with those who have died,\u201d said Atkinson. He added: \u201cIt therefore provides a reason for the killings, however deviant and repellent, that does not depend on an explanation of mental illness that deprived the defendant of his self-control.\u201d Atkinson added that there was no evidence of the defendant suffering from mental health problems until 2010, when Fuller complained of feeling depressed over pain in his legs.

{"title": "Jes Staley\u2019s exit from Barclays amid Epstein scrutiny raises eyebrows", "article": "Bank chief executives can survive an official censure, as Jes Staley proved in 2018 \u2013 when he kept his job despite being fined \u00a3642,000 for trying to unmask a whistleblower at Barclays. A second adverse finding tends to be terminal, however. This time Staley required complete vindication from regulators examining his, and the board\u2019s, description of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein. His resignation signals that he did not get what he needed: he had to go. What, precisely, do regulators judge that he got wrong this time? Impossible to say until the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority publish their report, which could be at least a month away; the only point of clarity currently is that there are \u201cno findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes\u201d, says Barclays. Fine, but the aim of the inquiry was to determine whether \u201ca close professional relationship\u201d, which was the gist of Staley\u2019s account of his dealings with the sex offender financier, was strictly accurate. Regulators are seemingly unhappy with his characterisation. Staley will contest the findings, as he\u2019s entitled to do. Viewed from outside, however, the most extraordinary aspect of the tale is not the narrow regulatory focus on who said what, and whether the presentation was crystal clear. One keeps coming back to the question of why Staley maintained any form of relationship with Epstein after the financier had been sentenced for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. There was a Florida visit the following year and then, most remarkably, Staley and his wife popped in by yacht to see Epstein on his Caribbean island in April 2015. Staley was not alone in maintaining links with the convicted paedophile, of course, but even veteran Wall Street bankers touting for deals should be careful about the company they keep. Staley\u2019s judgment was terrible. Regulatory run-ins aside, his performance as chief executive of Barclays has been better than the pedestrian share price would suggest. The biggest call was doubling up on investment banking, which was a risky bet on arrival in December 2015 but Barclays\u2019 financial returns have gone back to respectable levels. Staley\u2019s vision of a \u201ctransatlantic\u201d bank that combines UK mortgages and Wall Street trading has prevailed. Edward Bramson, the activist who agitated for a retreat from investment banking, was defeated by numbers. In its clinical way, the stock market marked the end of the Staley era with a fall of only 1% in Barclays share price. The boss was seen as likely to leave soon anyway, and the new chief executive is CS Venkatakrishnan, a Staley recruit from JP Morgan who will not upset the broad strategy. But even publication of the regulators\u2019 report, assuming Staley does not manage to overturn the findings of a 20-month inquiry, will not quite be the end of the story. There are also questions here for Nigel Higgins, the Barclays chair, and the rest of the board. The directors backed Staley all the way, and there was an air of defiance on Monday as they said they were \u201cdisappointed at this outcome\u201d and heaped praise on their man. Is that a wise stance? Staley could easily have been fired after the whistleblower affair. It\u2019s hard to see any upside for the bank in extending a quarrel with its two main regulators. UK-EU failings have led to Ryanair delisting Michael O\u2019Leary loves a throwaway line, but his plan to delist Ryanair from the London Stock Exchange sounds advanced. He blames Brexit, by which he means EU rules that require EU airlines to be majority owned by nationals from within the bloc plus a few other European countries that do not include the UK. One can call it another blow to the standing of the London market, but it is primarily a political failure on the part of the UK and EU to agree a deal on airline ownership. If it\u2019s OK for Swiss investors to own a slice of Irish-based Ryanair, there is no logic in denying UK investors. This is a Brexit loose-end that should have been settled in about five minutes of negotiation.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/nov/01/jes-staley-exit-barclays-epstein-scrutiny-bankers", "last_update": "2021-11-01T19:57:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Better late than never isn\u2019t quite the message of Cop26. The time for dawdling has been and gone. Countries need to act now. But then maybe Boris Johnson and the other world leaders were experiencing the same problems getting into the Glasgow venue as all the other punters. Johnson is something of a late convert to the reality of the climate crisis. We know that and he knows that. He\u2019s even admitted it was only when he got to Downing Street and academics walked him through the science that the penny really dropped. So you might have thought the prime minister would have chosen to play it fairly straight in welcoming everyone to Glasgow. Just thank them all for coming and make them aware of the responsibility they carry for saving the planet. Only Boris just cannot do serious. He needs the attention. He needs the laughs. So he started what should have been a plea to world leaders to put aside their self-interest and work constructively together with a reference to James Bond. If he\u2019d stopped at that, he might have got away with it. But Bertie Booster is compulsively needy. So the rest of his short speech was peppered with bad gags. Cows farting. Boris possibly still being prime minister in 2060 when he\u2019s 94. Further references to not everyone being able to look like James Bond.\nAll of which was met with silence by the world leaders assembled in the marquee. And the quieter it got, the more desperate Johnson became. You could see the flashes of panic in his eyes. Which isn\u2019t to say there wasn\u2019t some good material in between the attempted laughs. There was an acknowledgment that the world was now in the last chance saloon and that children wouldn\u2019t forgive the attenders in Glasgow if they blew it. That more \u2018blah, blah, blah\u2019 \u2013 Greta Thunberg TM \u2013 wouldn\u2019t cut it. That action was needed now to save humanity. \u201cWe can do it,\u201d said Bertie Booster. And we can. Only you could tell from the response \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 that everyone was wondering if Johnson was the man to lead us to the carbon-neutral promised land. Boris had yet again misjudged his audience. They had come for gravitas and he was just too lightweight, too flippant, too obviously amoral for not just the most serious but also the only game in town. If you\u2019re after a good time vibe with nothing much at stake, then Boris is your man. When the stakes are this high, then not so much. Prince Charles even appeared to be checking his phone during Boris\u2019s speech. Because at heart Bertie Booster is just another self-interested chancer. He can\u2019t even talk the talk, let alone walk the walk. His budget last week \u2013 and it was his more than Brand Rishi\u2019s \u2013 didn\u2019t once mention the climate crisis. Indeed he even cut air passenger duty. Not to mention reopening coalmines. After several exhortations from climate activists from the Pacific and the Andes, there were brief but worthy speeches from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and Prince Charles spelling out the realities of the situation. The Prince of Wales even went so far as to say the world should be on a warlike footing. Then it was left to the 95-year-old David Attenborough to inject some much-needed emotion and passion into the proceedings. Against a powerful backdrop of film, stats and music, Attenborough laid his heart on the line. When he says the world is in a doomsday scenario, then you believe him. He is a man who has devoted his life to saving the natural world. Not an apparatchik who has been to countless previous climate change conferences where he has learned to hedge his bets and make the vaguest of promises he is fairly certain he has no chance of keeping. There was an electricity in the hall when Attenborough said we could turn tragedy into triumph. Or maybe it was just a sense of collective guilt. Certainly Attenborough seemed to galvanise the politicians that followed. Mia Amor Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, didn\u2019t mince her words. The climate crisis wasn\u2019t an academic subject for her: it was a reality. If nothing was done then her island would disappear. \u201cWe want to exist in 100 years\u2019 time,\u201d she said. And she dared to suggest that Cop26 might already be a failure due to the no shows of presidents Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, but spelled out the financial realities. The developed countries had stumped up \u00a39tn in quantitative easing to cope with Covid. So coming up with \u00a3500bn a year for developing countries shouldn\u2019t be an impossibility. Though right now the wealthiest countries hadn\u2019t even kept their promise of \u00a3100bn a year. The opening session ended with Italy\u2019s Mario Draghi expressing his disappointment that the recent G20 in Rome had ended with such a feeble agreement on climate change. But by now, most world leaders had had enough of being reminded of their failures and were starting to get fidgety. It was time for their lunch and some side meetings. It would be nice if Cop26 was a success, but no one was counting on it. And some didn\u2019t even seem that bothered.

{"title": "Conte poised to take over as Tottenham manager after Nuno sacked", "article": "Antonio Conte has agreed to take over as Tottenham\u2019s manager on a contract to June 2023 and is ready to sign the deal subject to final details. He will replace Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who was sacked on Monday after four months and 17 matches in charge. Negotiations between Conte and Tottenham broke down in the summer but he did not take another job and the club\u2019s managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, made the former Juventus, Chelsea and Internazionale manager his No 1 target.\nBy Monday afternoon paperwork was being prepared by Spurs to confirm the appointment and Conte travelled to London with his representatives. Conte is generally averse to taking a job midway through a season but let it be known he would make an exception for Manchester United if Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r were sacked. Spurs convinced him to take the same view of their offer. Conte has asked for guarantees regarding the next transfer windows to rebuild a squad that has lost five times in the Premier League this season. Tottenham\u2019s talks with Conte collapsed in June after the club thought they were close to a deal. At that point Paratici, who worked with the manager for three successful seasons at Juventus from 2011, had not been hired and his presence has been crucial. Initial contact was made on Saturday night and Conte has been assured he will get more say over transfers and the chance to mould the team. Conte, who won league titles with Juve, Chelsea and Internazionale, left Inter in May over their plan to sell players. His spell at Juventus is the only time he has managed a team for more than two years and his Spurs contract is due to run for less than that. Nuno has gone after a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United on Saturday, during and after which he was barracked by supporters. Spurs turned to Nuno having failed to land a number of preferred candidates including Conte, Paulo Fonseca and Gennaro Gattuso.\nThe former Wolves manager began with three Premier League wins, the first against Manchester City, and was named August\u2019s manager of the month. But comprehensive defeats by Chelsea, Arsenal and United, coupled with an uninspiring style of play, prompted his dismissal. Spurs have gone two hours and 16 minutes without a shot on target in the Premier League. The Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, also a target for fans\u2019 anger on Saturday, and Paratici held talks after the United game before concluding a change was imperative. Tottenham are eighth in the Premier League and third in their Europa Conference League group, although they have reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. Paratici said: \u201cI know how much Nuno and his coaching staff wanted to succeed and I regret that we have had to take this decision. Nuno is a true gentleman and will always be welcome here. We should like to thank him and his coaching staff and wish them well for the future.\u201d\nThe team have scored nine goals in 10 Premier League games and Harry Kane, who had hoped to leave for City in the summer, has looked well below his best. Nuno succeeded Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after Ryan Mason had been placed in interim charge. Spurs confirmed Nuno\u2019s coaches \u2013 Ian Cathro, Rui Barbosa and Antonio Dias \u2013 have also left.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/01/nuno-sacked-by-tottenham-after-only-17-matches-as-manager", "last_update": "2021-11-02T07:29:49Z", "source": "Guardian"},

About 2,000 delegates and journalists were kept in large crowds queueing outside the conference centre, with Guardian reporters noting there seemed to have been a lack of planning, as no attempt was made to encourage people to queue rather than simply press forward. Boris Johnson channels spirit of James Bond Johnson drew an analogy between a ticking bomb that Bond must defuse in a film and the situation humanity finds itself in with the climate crisis. It\u2019s one minute to midnight on the doomsday clock and we need to act now. If we don\u2019t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to get serious about it tomorrow. Climate optimism an illusion, warns UN chief There was less optimism from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who dismissed the suggestion that the climate situation was improving, and exhorted the more than 120 national leaders present to \u201cchoose to safeguard our future and save humanity\u201d instead of continuing with the addiction to fossil fuels. David Attenborough says be \u2018motivated by hope not fear\u2019 David Attenborough called in his speech at the conference for a new industrial revolution powered by millions of sustainable innovations.

In yours, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery. Biden apologises for Trump quitting Paris agreement Biden attempted to reassert America\u2019s credibility at the UN climate talks by apologising for the behaviour of his predecessor. \u201cWe will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been the case, which is why my administration is working overtime to show our climate commitment is action not words.\u201d Xi Jinping no-show and no significant climate pledges China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, called for developed countries to \u201cprovide support to help developing countries do better\u201d in dealing with the climate crisis, in a written statement that failed to make any new significant pledges. Xi, along with Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Vladimir Putin of Russia, decided not to appear in person at the summit. India to target net zero emissions by 2070 The most positive news came late in the day, with Narendra Modi\u2019s pledge that his country will meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070. He also committed to India getting half of its energy from renewable resources by 2030. Modi demanded developed countries make $1tn available as climate finance. Bolsonaro\u2019s \u2018green powerhouse\u2019 speech criticised While not attending the conference in person, Bolsonaro claimed in a speech on Monday that when it came to fighting climate change, Brazil had always been part of the solution, not the problem. But Amazon forest defenders are urging delegates at Cop26 not to trust the \u201cgreenwashing\u201d promises of Bolsonaro\u2019s government. Johnson to fly back to London \u2013 avoiding the train Finally, it emerged later in the day that Boris Johnson was still channelling James Bond as it was confirmed he would be flying back from the Cop26 climate conference on a private plane rather than getting the train.

{"title": "Levy faces test of true Spurs ambition after doomed dance with Nuno | Barney Ronay", "article": "Farewell then, Nuno. It was, let\u2019s face it, almost entirely doomed from the start, to the extent there is pretty much zero point in analysing the gains, the losses and the legacy of Nuno-era Spurs. What memories will Tottenham\u2019s 35th permanent managerial appointment leave in north London? A way of standing. An expression of sympathetic bafflement. The sense, above all, of a head coach who seemed at all times to be encrusted with an ancient sadness, a courtly keeper of the grail in someone else\u2019s castle, whose final words, dispatched by the hand of Daniel Levy, will be \u201cHe chose \u2026 poorly\u201d.\nBut what did Spurs expect from a manager who plateaued out at Wolverhampton, who lost 17 league games last season, whose football is about control and caution and who they didn\u2019t really want in the first place? Instead, as the club turns its sights towards next things and the electrifying prospect of Antonio Conte, there are only two points worth taking from the Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo interlude. Both of these are familiar territory. Both will speak to whatever it is Conte can expect to achieve in this job. First, what is a Tottenham manager for? This is a club defined too often by the appearance of progress, by light, noise and drama that exist in their own space, unrelated to any obvious substance. Consider, for example, the past seven months. Spurs have fired Jos\u00e9 Mourinho less than a week before a cup final, tried and failed to kickstart a super league, successfully demotivated Harry Kane, hired a fancy director of football, appointed the last man on the long list, sacked the last man on the long list and enacted a dramatic pursuit of the most high-profile unemployed manager in world football.\nIn that time Spurs have moved from seventh in the Premier League to eighth. What has this cost? What has been the price tag on that mild nudge down the league table? Presumably anything up to \u00a350m in payoffs, wasted wages and the declining value of your chief playing asset. It is, if nothing else, a very dramatic way of not doing very much. But then this has been the role of the Spurs manager, which involves, in its simple form, a kind of El Tel impresario quality, injecting some kind of life, vibes, energy, into this carefully metered environment. Nuno was never likely to win much. But he was never going come close to this model, he is a naturally conservative coach with the look on the touchline of a kindly hill farmer concerned by the travails of his favourite sickly heifer at the hands of the local vet. This is the second point. Is Levy prepared to reach for anything beyond this? To play that game for real? Because Conte is something else entirely. Not just a serious pedigree upgrade but a more profound shift of culture. This is an appointment that may just amount to a calling of the Levy bluff, a flushing out of that ruthless, strictly-business executive culture. Here is a manager who also doesn\u2019t want a long-term thing. But he will make you win if you\u2019re really serious. Muck this one up, fail once again to take the leap forward, and it will be entirely on Levy. Conte knows how to do this thing.\nThere have been some oddly negative noises off in the past few days, a suggestion English football may have reason to be wary of a manager this ruthlessly driven. It is to be taken with a pinch of salt. He may lack the brand-friendly PR chops of a Solskj\u00e6r. But Conte is a restless, angry, precision-engineered tactician. This is a manager who began slowly in his first season at Chelsea, went home for an insomniac holiday during the autumn break, came back with a plan and ran way with the league title playing Victor Moses at wing-back and David Luiz in a back three. It wasn\u2019t all about control. Chelsea scored 85 goals. Conte got another title season out of Eden Hazard. He has five league titles at three clubs. Everything is urgency, fixes, fast-forward planning. He may have the right stuff for Kane, who needs someone bigger than him, some hard coaching and a clarification of what kind of player he wants to be. You want success? The man who can provide it is already at the door, scowling in through the fanlight, rattling at the locks. But he demands seriousness in return, a total commitment, an absence of flannel.\nThis is the subtext to every move at Tottenham. This is a club run by a chairman who walks a strange kind of tightrope, balancing the demands of the crowd, the opera of fandom, with both a professional and a proposal eye on profit and loss. Levy sees the financial absurdities of his profession, errs towards probity and caution, but also seems to have bodged the chance to invest in something more. How much does this club really want success? And what would it look like? Is it simply existing close to the elite, preserving its income, doing the executive dance? Or the cold hard lust for trophies, for the kind of moments supporters crave?\nThe biggest mistake Spurs made was the failure to back Mauricio Pochettino when times were good. They posted record profits the year they reached the Champions League final. But that squad was allowed to age, Kane to run himself into the ground. The asset was sweated to death when it could have been nourished, made into a team to sustain that level. If Conte does arrive he will be the fifth occupant of that manager\u2019s office in two and half years since the move to the multi-use mega\u2011ground. His presence is also a kind of endgame, a calling-out of what the wider ambition really is here. Conte doesn\u2019t care what your excuses are. He has employers waiting elsewhere if you\u2019re going to send him out to battle with a baguette in his hand. It will, at the very least, be fascinating to watch.

{"title": "BBC rejects complaints that it published transphobic article", "article": "The BBC has rejected complaints that it published a transphobic article and has instead given a commitment to covering different viewpoints in the name of impartiality. The corporation has faced protests outside some of its regional newsrooms, petitions from trans campaign groups and disquiet among many LGBTQ+ staff members over a piece published online last week entitled \u201cWe\u2019re being pressured into sex by some trans women\u201d. On Monday the BBC said it stood by the article about the experience of some lesbians, adding it had been subject to a rigorous editing process, and that it met its editorial guidelines. In response to people who said the piece was \u201ctransphobic and poorly evidenced\u201d, the BBC said: \u201cWe have a strong commitment to impartiality, which means we constantly consider and evaluate which stories to cover and how. Impartiality is fundamental, and includes covering stories on any point of the spectrum of debate. And stories should be seen not just individually, but in the broader context of our wider coverage.\u201d Tim Davie, the corporation\u2019s director general, has repeatedly emphasised the need for impartiality and including a wider range of viewpoints in the BBC\u2019s output. However, there remains confusion within the BBC over topics that are considered beyond debate in the corporation\u2019s news output and which topics are considered matters of political debate, where multiple arguments must always be presented in the name of impartiality. Many external critics of last week\u2019s article focused on its use of a self-selecting survey of 80 people produced by a small campaign group that has claimed trans activism within the LGBTQ+ movement is erasing lesbians. The BBC argued that the lack of data on whether lesbians are being pressured to have sex with trans women justified the caveated inclusion of the group\u2019s survey, which was just one part of a longer piece. The BBC said readers are free to click a link to the survey findings and \u201cmake up their own minds\u201d about the validity of the responses. One BBC source saidthe broadcaster has received 4,819 complaints about the article but a further 5,520 people wrote in to note their approval of the piece. The Guardian understands the article had been the subject of debate for some time before it was published and was subject to extensive back-and-forth editing. Bosses were acutely aware of the likely reaction to it on social media \u2013 and among the BBC\u2019s own staff, who are often deeply split on the issue of trans rights. Because it was reported by a Nottingham-based journalist in one of the BBC\u2019s regional newsrooms, it was ultimately the responsibility of the BBC England division. Although the distinction would not be apparent to the typical reader, this means it was subject to a different editorial commissioning process to material produced out of the BBC\u2019s national news headquarters. It was also published soon after the release of a 10-part podcast made by BBC Northern Ireland\u2019s Stephen Nolan which looked at whether the BBC had itself been \u201ccaptured\u201d by the LGBTQ+ rights organisation Stonewall. That series was alternately celebrated and decried by BBC staff, depending on their attitude towards trans rights.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/01/bbc-rejects-complaints-that-it-published-transphobic-article", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:51:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The deal will include the creation of about 1,000 jobs at two campuses \u2013 one in northern England and one in Qatar \u2013 where climate technology businesses will be created, launched and developed. It is hoped that a further 10,000 roles will be created at the businesses launched at the campuses and in the wider clean-tech economy. The goal is for five \u201cunicorn\u201d companies \u2013 private firms valued at more than $1bn (\u00a3732m) \u2013 to be created at the centres by 2030, rising to 20 by 2040, which would in time provide returns to investors. The design of the campuses and the exact UK location has yet to be decided, and there will need to be access to local skills and manufacturing supply chain. Derby-based Rolls-Royce has several sites and suppliers based in the north of England. The Qatar Foundation, the state\u2019s non-profit organisation created in 1995 to focus on education and research, will provide the funding to develop the campuses and support their operations for two decades. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce will bring the knowhow in engineering and high-end manufacturing, and will use the centre to develop emerging climate technologies. Startup businesses will be provided with academic help and funding for research and development on campus, combined with early-stage venture capital investment, so they can test, prove and later scale-up their technologies.

{"title": "Republican contender in Virginia avoids Trump\u2019s campaign event", "article": "Donald Trump was to host a Virginia campaign event on Monday for Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor in a race headed down to the wire. But Youngkin was not planning to participate, as he attempted to balance appeals to the former president\u2019s supporters with a semblance of independence.\nTrump hoped a phone-in \u201ctele rally\u201d would hoist Youngkin past his Democratic opponent, the former governor Terry McAuliffe. The contest is seen by many as a referendum on the Biden presidency and a bellwether for midterm elections next year. On the day before polling day, the realclearpolitics.com polling average had Youngkin ahead by less than two points. Fivethirtyeight.com put the Republican up by one. McAuliffe had scheduled rallies in Roanoke, Virginia Beach and Richmond and in northern Virginia. Youngkin was to rally in Roanoke, Richmond, Virginia Beach and Loudon county. In Richmond, Youngkin addressed \u201can energetic crowd of what his campaign said was around 800 people\u201d at a small airport, the Associated Press reported. \u201cThis is a moment for Virginians to push back on this left, liberal progressive agenda and take our commonwealth back,\u201d he said. McAuliffe, who has called himself a \u201cpro-business pro-progressive\u201d, is a close ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton and has campaigned with President Joe Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris, former president Barack Obama and other high-profile Democrats. Nonetheless he has struggled to generate enthusiasm in a state Biden won by 10 points. Youngkin, a businessman, has not appeared with Trump. On Saturday, he told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be engaged in the tele-town hall. The teams are talking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Youngkin has however comfortably dealt in Trump-esque attack lines, most prominently and potentially fruitfully focusing on how race is taught in schools. In return McAuliffe has sought to tie Youngkin firmly to Trump, not a tough task in the debate over education. Youngkin has repeatedly raised the subject of critical race theory, an academic discipline turned into a bogeyman by Republicans nationwide. CRT examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. It is not taught in Virginia public schools. Regardless, Youngkin has treated it as a genuine threat, stoking anger on the right, and has promised to ban it. Speaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, McAuliffe said Youngkin had gone too far. Citing a meeting with a voter in Hampton, he said the former school board member told him \u201cour school boards were fine. Soon as Glenn Youngkin got nominated, all of a sudden, these people started showing up, creating such a ruckus, calling such obscene things\u201d. \u201cThis was an African American woman,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat on air what they\u2019ve said about her. This was last night, up here in northern Virginia \u2026 we just lost a school board member \u2026 She said, \u2018I was getting death threats. But when they said they were going to rape my children, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s what Glenn Youngkin has done here in Virginia. He\u2019s created hatred and division just like Donald Trump, and that\u2019s why Donald Trump, his final campaign is going to be for Glenn Youngkin here in Virginia. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Trump. We don\u2019t want Youngkin. We don\u2019t want the hatred and division.\u201d In a statement on Monday, Trump freely demonstrated his willingness to exploit hatred and division.\nTaking barely veiled shots at the Lincoln Project \u2013 anti-Trump Republicans who have campaigned against him in Virginia, sometimes controversially, and who Trump referred to only as \u201cperverts\u201d \u2013 the former president said his enemies were \u201ctrying to create an impression that Glenn Youngkin and I are at odds and don\u2019t like each other. \u201cImportantly, this is not true. We get along very well together and strongly believe in many of the same policies, especially when it comes to the important subject of education.\u201d Trump reiterated the need for Republicans to vote. He also sought to thread the needle between his insistence on mass voter fraud against him and the need for high Republican turnout \u2013 a trick he failed to pull off in Georgia in January, when Democrats won two Senate runoffs. If enough of his supporters voted, Trump said, they would overcome the fact that he was \u201cnot a believer in the integrity of Virginia\u2019s elections\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin", "last_update": "2021-11-01T20:15:30Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Public told to avoid potentially deadly plant washed up on Cumbria beaches", "article": "Plants that look and smell like parsnips but are highly poisonous and potentially deadly have been washed up on beaches in Cumbria after the recent stormy weather. Coastguards have warned people to avoid the plants called hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata), which is also known as dead man\u2019s fingers. The coastguard rescue team based in Millom said they had received reports of the plant being washed up on local beaches. \u201cEven a small portion can prove fatal to humans by attacking the nervous system,\u201d they said on their Facebook page. \u201cIt is also fatal to animals. The plant has a highly poisonous root that looks and smells like parsnip. \u201cIt is highly likely that this is happening due to the aftermath of recent stormy weather. We advise people, especially with children and animals, to stay vigilant, avoid this plant and take extra care when visiting the beach.\u201d Hemlock water dropwort, with leaves and stems which look like parsley, is one of Britain\u2019s most poisonous indigenous plants. Eating it can cause nausea, vomiting, fever, seizures and hallucination. Deaths have occurred but are far more common in animals than humans, said Geoff Dann, a foraging teacher and writer who is about to publish a new book on edible plants. \u201cIt is known to kill livestock. Usually what happens is that it gets disturbed by the edge of a river by earthworks, or something, and the roots are exposed and are eaten by livestock.\n\u201cThere are also cases of people digging it up and thinking it is a plant you can eat, like water parsnip or wild celery \u2026 but that is pretty rare.\u201d It is highly poisonous \u201cbut you\u2019d have to eat a lot of it to die\u201d, he said. \u201cThey are great big fat tubers, but who walks along a beach and picks up a random wild plant washed up on a beach and eats it? It seems a weird thing to do.\u201d Deaths are rare but the unpleasantness and dangers of the plant was highlighted by a report in the Emergency Medical Journal (EMJ) about eight young adults on holiday in Argyll. They collected what they thought were water parsnips from a stream and made a curry. Ten hours later one of the group had a seizure and was taken to hospital. Others also became unwell and nauseous and a further person had be admitted to hospital after eating leftovers. The EMJ report concluded: \u201cIt is possible that with increasing interest in \u2018natural\u2019 foods, accidental poisoning of this nature may become more frequent. These cases illustrate the potential dangers of this, but highlight the fact that even in small communities expertise is available and if accessed appropriately can be invaluable.\u201d Researchers in Italy have also written that hemlock water dropwort was used in pre-Roman Sardinia for the ritual killing of older people considered a burden. The plant, it has been said, leaves corpses with what could be described as a sardonic grin. Dann said the plant was not Britain\u2019s most toxic. That accolade, he believes, should go to monkshood, or wolf\u2019s bane. \u201cThere was a case a few years ago of a guy clearing it and he had a cut on his hand.

{"title": "The Guardian view on the family courts: secrecy isn\u2019t working | Editorial", "article": "On average around 4,300 cases a week are heard in the family courts in England and Wales \u2013 adding up to a total of 224,902 last year. It is estimated that 62% of cases involve allegations of domestic abuse. Almost a quarter are disputes between separating or separated couples, usually over their children. For the past three years, the number of applications for children to be taken into council care has been around 13,000; the number in care now stands at a record 80,000, up from 65,000 a decade ago. Yet despite such startling figures, and the strong public interest in understanding the societal issues that underlie them, remarkably little is known by most people about what goes on in family courts. What is known is more likely to be anecdotal, via word of mouth or personal experience, than by a formal public channel such as the press or other media. That\u2019s because since 1960 there has been a presumption of secrecy in all cases involving children. Journalists and legal bloggers have the right to attend court, but not to report on what goes on there. In recent years there have been several attempts to open up the courts to increased scrutiny, while continuing to respect confidentiality so that children are never publicly identified. But the transparency review published last week by the president of the high court\u2019s family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, should ensure that real change at last takes place. Having convened a panel and taken evidence, Sir Andrew has come down emphatically on the side of journalists and open justice campaigners. His report says that the pace of change so far has been \u201cglacial\u201d, and calls for a \u201cmajor shift in culture and process\u201d so that openness becomes \u201cthe new norm\u201d. Specifically, journalists will be allowed to report on what goes on in family courts as of right, subject to anonymisation, and family members will be allowed to speak to reporters. Judges will be instructed to publish 10% of their judgments in anonymised form. More details of cases will be included on court lists, and there will be an annual report. Sir Andrew also wants to build a relationship of trust between the judiciary and the media, starting with a pilot reporting scheme in two areas. Sensitive questions remain. These include which documents reporters will have access to, particularly when these include descriptions of abuse. There are also resource considerations, both on the courts\u2019 and on the press\u2019s side. With the court service already under enormous pressure due to legal aid and other cuts, and rising poverty and the withdrawal of support services leading to higher caseloads, it is not clear how the anonymising of thousands of judgments will be accomplished. It remains to be seen what use news organisations will make of the increased access, at a time when coverage of the criminal courts has been reduced. But these are caveats. The overarching purpose, as Sir Andrew sets out, is not merely to reveal what goes in the family courts but to learn from it. More data, and the accountability that follows from increased scrutiny, should be expected to lead to improved practice. Family judges hold immense power, and society as a whole would benefit from an increased understanding of what they do, why they do it, and how this alters the course of hundreds of thousands of lives every year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-family-courts-secrecy-isnt-working", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:13:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Discredit history: 10 years of Barclays scandals", "article": "Scandals at Barclays have cost the UK bank two chief executives in less than a decade. We take a look at some of the controversies that have plagued the bank since the 2008 financial crisis. 2012: Financial crisis fundraising The Serious Fraud Office launches an investigation in 2012, and eventually accuses Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatari investors in exchange for emergency funding at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. It resulted in the only criminal trial brought against UK banking executives during the financial crisis, and involved four senior bankers, including the chief executive, John Varley. Varley was acquitted by an appeals court in June 2019, while the three remaining executives were found not guilty in a criminal trial in February 2020. 2012: Libor rigging scandal Barclays is fined for manipulating the benchmark Libor interest rate in 2012, after revelations stretching back to 2005. The scandal, which engulfed a number of its global banking peers, results in the resignation of its chief executive, Bob Diamond, after just 18 months in the post. 2013: Salz review An independent review of Barclays\u2019 business practices urges the bank to strengthen its board, cooperate more closely with City watchdogs, and link pay more closely to the bank\u2019s performance after discovering a \u201cwinning at all costs\u201d culture at the lender. 2017: Whistleblowing scandal The chief executive, Jes Staley, is fined almost \u00a3650,000 and ordered to repay \u00a3500,000 of his bonus for twice attempting to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Staley used the bank\u2019s internal security unit to try to discover who had written letters to the board regarding a new hire at Barclays, who was also a former friend and colleague of Staley\u2019s at JP Morgan. Staley later apologised to the bank\u2019s board. 2017: KKR dispute Staley caused a rift between the bank and its private equity client KKR after backing his brother-in-law in a complicated legal dispute with the buyout house. While Staley argued that he was involved in a personal capacity, rather than as chief executive of Barclays, it strained the bank\u2019s relationship with one of its longtime clients. 2020: Staveley lawsuit Businesswoman Amanda Staveley takes Barclays to court after learning that it had offered her Abu Dhabi client a worse deal than that it offered to Qatari investors when it was seeking emergency funding in 2008. Staveley lost the court battle in February 2021, despite the judge finding that the bank was \u201cguilty of serious deceit\u201d in the way it raised money to avoid a UK government bailout at the height of the financial crisis. 2020: Epstein investigation Barclays announces that City regulators have opened an investigation into Staley over his characterisation of his relationship with the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to Barclays, and \u201cthe subsequent description of that relationship in the company\u2019s response to the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority]\u201d.

{"title": "Sensational Jos Buttler century sets up England win over Sri Lanka", "article": "So that answers that one, then. In a tournament where everything had gone England\u2019s way, this time it all went against them: asked to bat first after losing the toss, labouring to work out how to pace their innings, bowling as dew drenched the outfield on a heavy, humid night, watching Tymal Mills limp off midway through his second over to shred their death bowling plans as Sri Lanka accelerated towards their target. But they refused to throw in the towel \u2013 after all, they needed it to soak dew off the ball \u2013 and thanks to the genius of Jos Buttler an often unpleasant evening became one to savour. Sri Lanka were beaten by 26 runs and with a 100% record after four games a place in the semi-finals is all but secured.\nButtler led the team off, his colleagues walking 10 paces behind and applauding him all the way. Forty-eight hours after his 32-ball 71 powered England to victory over Australia in Dubai, their diamond demonstrated several other facets of his brilliance with a 67-ball century, transforming an innings that for a while, as so many have in this tournament, got lost in the doldrums. But with the wind in his sails there are few batters to match Buttler and he accelerated to his first international Twenty20 century \u2013 becoming the second English player, after Heather Knight, to hit hundreds in all three formats \u2013 by lifting the final ball of the innings over square-leg for six. Over the course of 20 overs he was England\u2019s opener, their anchor and their finisher. How they needed him. The thing about auras of invincibility is that, handsome as they are when they settle upon you, they are not very hardwearing. Just a couple of scratches and off it comes. It had taken three wonderfully dominant victories for England to construct the one they sported coming into this fixture, but within 20 minutes it was looking distinctly ragged.\nWhat has set this England team apart as they have clambered from white-ball ignominy to supremacy over the past six years is an unwavering consistency of intent. They go hard and, no matter the circumstances, they keep going hard. No let-up, no respite. Here, though, for an extended period they went worryingly limp. On an unfamiliar ground, on a wicket that was skating-rink flat and sometimes similarly skiddy, they could not find their footing for a long time. It did not help their cause that Sri Lanka, who had played three times in Sharjah at this World Cup, have a gem of their own in Wanindu Hasaranga, who claimed the wickets of Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow and Eoin Morgan in four excellent overs. He has taken 34 wickets in 2021, the most by any bowler in any single year in this format. But once Buttler started his acceleration Sri Lanka had no answer. His first 50 took 45 balls and his second 22, as he made the short boundaries look positively microscopic. Morgan took 19 balls to reach eight and then another 17 to reach 40 and between them they dragged England to a total of 163 for four. Sri Lanka, so soundly beaten in England in June and July, are a rapidly improving side, and this was a compelling contest until the final minutes. Once again England took three wickets in the powerplay, but Sri Lanka remained on some kind of track to reach their target until a dramatic late implosion. Mills\u2019s injury helped, the fast bowler pulling up halfway through the 14th over to force Morgan into an on-the-hoof rethink of England\u2019s tactical plans. He settled on a devilishly cunning one: robbed of the man who often bowls the 20th over, England ended the match in 19. Hasaranga was primarily responsible for keeping Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes alive that long, the 24-year-old scoring 34 off 21 and putting on 53 for the sixth wicket with his captain, Dasun Shanaka. But once he went the innings crumbled in a few chaotic minutes of wild hitting and superlative fielding. It started with Hasaranga scooping Liam Livingstone to long-off, where Jason Roy sprinted to his left and aware that he was heading inexorably towards the rope tossed the ball to the substitute fielder, Sam Billings, to complete the catch.\nFour balls later Shanaka was run out by Buttler, running around from behind the stumps, flinging off his gloves as he went, before hitting the stumps from 15 yards. Three catches in the deep later 129 for five had become 137 all out. Sri Lanka had shown that England are fallible, but they could not make them fall.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/england-sri-lanka-t20-world-cup-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-01T23:10:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Prince Andrew\u2019s criticisms of Virginia Giuffre may backfire, lawyers say", "article": "Prince Andrew\u2019s attacks on Virginia Giuffre\u2019s character in an attempt to get her sexual assault lawsuit against him thrown out may fail and risk doing further damage to his reputation, British lawyers have said. Having initially attempted to prevent service of the suit, which alleges that he sexually abused Giuffre when she was 17, the prince\u2019s lawyers went on the offensive over the weekend in an attempt to get her \u201cbaseless\u201d claim dismissed. Their filings accuse Giuffre of seeking a \u201cpayday\u201d at Andrew\u2019s expense and contain references from friends and in newspaper articles to her being a \u201cmoney hungry sex kitten\u201d and recruiting girls for the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, awaiting trial. At the same time they argue that a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein, formerly a friend of Andrew, absolves the prince from responsibility, a notion rejected by Giuffre\u2019s lawyer. Mark Stephens, a partner at Howard Kennedy and UK media law expert, said it would take a brave judge to dismiss the case and suggested Prince Andrew had potentially opened himself up to further embarrassment. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously got fed up with the criticism that he\u2019s taken so he has instructed lawyers to engage,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cThe problem of course, is that he\u2019s now embarked on a route towards a case. He\u2019s saying it should be struck out because she\u2019s unreliable but also that he\u2019s covered by the plea deal from Epstein in any event, which seemed to be sort of contradictory. \u201cThe problem you\u2019ve got is he clearly as a human being wants to explain himself, he wants to make clear that he\u2019s not responsible but his only way of doing that is in the court hearing. And if he does that, he has to get into what he actually did with her, how did the photograph [with Giuffre] come to be taken etc [allies of Andrew have claimed the photo was faked and he says he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting her] and she will undoubtedly give graphic and detailed evidence about what she says were their liaisons\u201d. Andrew, 61, has \u201cabsolutely and categorically\u201d denied having sex with Giuffre but the allegations have already done huge damage to his reputation. The Queen\u2019s second son stepped back from royal duties in 2019 in the aftermath of a disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC\u2019s Newsnight in which he was perceived as unsympathetic towards Epstein\u2019s victims. His lawyers\u2019 latest strategy risks exacerbating that perception, according to a senior partner at a leading London law firm, who described the allegations in the filings as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d. The solicitor, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cThis looks like putting up a smokescreen to tarnish her [Giuffre\u2019s] reputation but it has no legal relevance whatsoever. Whether or not she was complicit in assisting Epstein with his child abuse is neither here nor there when you consider the allegations against Prince Andrew, which are that he raped and molested her. However he tarnishes her character, it makes absolutely no difference to that issue.\u201d He said an English judge would ignore it and while there was more chance of US jurors being swayed by it, there was no guarantee. \u201cA jury might think, \u2018This is an American citizen, and who\u2019s this prince trying to blacken the character of one of our own?\u2019, so it\u2019s a high-risk strategy even with a jury, I would have thought,\u201d he said. In her lawsuit, Giuffre alleged the prince \u201cstonewalled\u201d, rejecting a request to explore alternative dispute resolution. The attempts to challenge service and jurisdiction further raised uncertainty about his level of engagement with the case but Richard Spafford, partner at Reed Smith, said it was \u201cfairly standard\u201d to try to stop the lawsuit in its tracks and only when those tactics failed, address the actual merits of the case. \u201cI can only assume that it\u2019s been decided within his advisory team that, notwithstanding the fact that his application will attract publicity, that it\u2019s nonetheless the appropriate step to take,\u201d said Spafford. \u201cOn the basis of that there must be a view that these arguments raise the possibility that the case will be dismissed by the judge, or, alternatively, that the plaintiff may be more likely to conclude that it\u2019s appropriate to settle it.\u201d Thomas Garner, partner at Fladgate, said the attacks on Giuffre showed the gloves were off even if it might do \u201cirreparable\u201d damage to the prince\u2019s reputation. \u201cIf there was any doubt as to how he would handle the claim, this application makes it clear that if [the judge] doesn\u2019t dismiss the claim then Prince Andrew intends to go on the attack,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/01/prince-andrews-criticisms-of-virginia-giuffre-may-backfire-lawyers-warn", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:47:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Guardian view on spooky science: AI needs regulating before it\u2019s too late | Editorial", "article": "\u201cProgress in AI is something that will take a while to happen, but [that] doesn\u2019t make it science fiction.\u201d So Stuart Russell, the University of California computing professor, told the Guardian at the weekend. The scientist said researchers had been \u201cspooked\u201d by their own success in the field. Prof Russell, the co-author of the top artificial intelligence (AI) textbook, is giving this year\u2019s BBC\u2019s Reith lectures \u2013 which have just begun \u2013 and his doubts appear increasingly relevant. With little debate about its downsides, AI is becoming embedded in society. Machines now recommend online videos to watch, perform surgery and send people to jail. The science of AI is a human enterprise that requires social limitations. The risks, however, are not being properly weighed. There are two emerging approaches to AI. The first is to view it in engineering terms, where algorithms are trained on specific tasks. The second presents deeper philosophical questions about the nature of human knowledge. Prof Russell engages with both these perspectives. The former is very much pushed by Silicon Valley, where AI is deployed to get products quickly to market and problems dealt with later. This has led to AI \u201csucceeding\u201d even when the goals aren\u2019t socially acceptable and they are pursued with little accountability. The pitfalls of this approach are highlighted by the role YouTube\u2019s algorithm plays in radicalising people, given that there is no public understanding of how it works. Prof Russell argues, reasonably, for a system of checks where machines can pause and \u201cask\u201d for human guidance, and for regulations to deal with systemic biases. The academic also backs global adoption of EU legislation that would ban impersonation of humans by machines. Computers are getting closer to passing, in a superficial way, the Turing test \u2013 where machines attempt to trick people into believing they are communicating with other humans. Yet human knowledge is collective: to truly fool humans a computer would have to be able to grasp mutual understandings. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, probably the best non-human writer ever, cannot comprehend what it spews. When Oxford scientists put it \u2013 and similar AIs \u2013 to the test this year, they found the machines produced false answers to questions that \u201cmimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive\u201d. It so troubled one of OpenAI\u2019s own researchers that no one knew how such language is being made that he left to set up an AI safety lab. Some argue that AI can already produce new insights that humans have missed. But human intelligence is much more than an algorithm. Inspiration strikes when a brilliant thought arises that can\u2019t be explained as a logical consequence of preceding steps. Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity cannot be derived from observations of that age \u2013 it was experimentally proven only decades later. Human beings can also learn a new task by being shown how to do it only a few times. Machines, so far, cannot. Currently, AI can be prompted \u2013 but not prompt itself \u2013 into action. Ajeya Cotra, a tech analyst with the US-based Open Philanthropy Project, reckoned a computer that could match the human brain might arrive by 2052 (and come with a $1tn price tag). We need to find better ways to build it. Humans are stumbling into an era when the more powerful the AI system, the harder it is to explain its actions. How can we tell if a machine is acting on our behalf and not acting contrary to our interests?

Officials have been battling fierce resistance among a minority of workers in some critical public safety jobs, including police officers and firefighters, with a pending legal challenge to the mandate from the largest police union. As of Sunday, one in four of uniformed New York firefighters had not had a first dose of the vaccine, as required. About one in six police personnel and one in six sanitation workers were still unvaccinated. About 2,300 firefighters were out sick, up from a norm of around 1,000 a day, in what Nigro said appeared to be a protest against the vaccine mandate. The fire department medical office normally saw about 200 people a day, Nigro said. Over the past week, it had been 700 a day, most of them unvaccinated. As officials prepared for staffing shortfalls, calling in vaccinated employees for overtime shifts, Nigro called on firefighters to stop misusing sick leave. \u201cThese are understaffed units,\u201d he said. \u201cThat understaffing could end immediately if members stopped going sick when they weren\u2019t sick. Once the members come to their senses and stop using medical leave improperly, they can help out not just the citizens of the city but their brothers and sisters staffing the units.\u201d De Blasio said the city was watching to see if the firefighters union was coordinating the sick-outs and would take it to court if there was evidence of an illegal strike. He said firefighters found to be faking illness would be \u201cawol effectively\u201d and would face internal discipline. The head of the union that represents New York City firefighters, which has fought the vaccine mandate, warned that public safety could be at risk. The fire department has said it is prepared to take up to 20% of companies out of service and have 20% fewer ambulances on the road.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because of a mandate that was put not only on our members, but also all New York City employees, given nine days to make a life-changing decision on their career or whether or not they\u2019re going to take a vaccine,\u201d said the Uniformed Firefighters Association president, Andrew Ansbro. On Friday, six firefighters were suspended for four weeks without pay after they drove a fire engine to the Brooklyn office of a New York state senator, Zellnor Myrie, to protest the vaccine mandate. According to Myrie\u2019s spokesman, Matt Baer, the firefighters asked to discuss the mandate. They asked where the senator lived and said the city would have blood on its hands due to the mandate. Over the weekend, numerous FDNY members also protested outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor\u2019s residence.

{"title": "Tigrayan forces\u2019 capture of two towns raises fears for Ethiopian capital", "article": "The weekend seizure of two key towns on the main road to Addis Ababa has alarmed Ethiopian leaders who fear that the rapid advances by Tigrayan rebel forces may soon threaten the capital itself. The sudden push into the towns of Dessie and Kombolcha was accompanied by short bursts of intense fighting that had reportedly subsided by Monday evening. While Dessie was confirmed to have fallen to the rebels on Sunday, the fate of Kombolcha was less clear, with accounts of continuing sporadic gunfire. Nevertheless, the rebel offensive was the most decisive yet in the year-long conflict with Ethiopian government forces, and led the country\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to call for loyalists to double efforts to defend the seat of power. \u201cUse any type of weapons to block the destructive [rebel push], to overturn it and bury it,\u201d he said. \u201cDying for Ethiopia is a duty for all of us.\u201d Government officials claimed, without offering evidence, that up to 100 youths had been executed during the Tigrayan takeover of Kombolcha \u2013 adding weight to rebel boasts of having seized control of the northern town. Kombolcha residents contacted by Agence France Presse described chaos as rebels approached. \u201cThe night was filled with many gunshots,\u201d one man told the news agency. \u201cI heard an airstrike past midnight outside Kombolcha borders.\u201d A second man, Hamdiu, a shopkeeper in Kombolcha, said he heard what sounded like an airstrike in the late evening. \u201cHuge gunshots were heard until morning\u201d, he said. Federal government forces have frequently used airstrikes in the Tigray region as the war has ground on, but denied having done so in Kombolcha.\nAs fears mounted of a continued push to Addis Ababa, 380km farther south, a spokesman for the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF), Getachew Reda, denied the organisation had designs on the capital and claimed the offensive aimed only to break the government siege on the Tigray region, which had been imposed by Ahmed in 2019. The seeds of the fighting, which has sparked mass internal displacement and reports of a near-famine in some regions, were laid as Ahmed attempted to consolidate his authority, after taking power a year earlier, partly by merging opposition and regional political parties into his own. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly three decades, refused to join and subsequently held regional elections that the Ahmed-led government declared illegal. Since fighting erupted in 2021, it has drawn in troops from nearby Eritrea and Ethiopia\u2019s Amhara region and threatened to spill even further throughout the country and across its borders to Sudan and Somalia. The war has led to frequent claims of rapes, massacre, enslavement and widespread humanitarian abuses. Chronicling the suffering has been all but impossible, with most aid agencies, including the UN, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the Norwegian Refugee Council, banned from the country, and journalists forbidden from covering the fighting. Agencies have estimated that about 4.5 million people are in need of aid, and about 1 million are in areas that are inaccessible. In June, the UN estimated that 400,000 people were already at risk of famine-like conditions. International reaction to the Tigrayan advance has been restrained. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington was alarmed by the \u201creports of the TPLF takeover of Dessie and Kombolcha. \u201cContinued fighting prolongs the dire humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia,\u201d he said on Twitter. Regional authorities in Amhara had earlier estimated that almost 250,000 people had taken refuge in both towns, having fled fighting elsewhere in the country. Officials in Amhara on Monday ordered government institutions to stop work and join the war effort. Before Ahmed took power, Tigrayans had held sway over much of the Ethiopian military and had brought much of that power to bear on the battlefields. Government forces, however, have control of the skies and widespread reports have emerged of Ahmed\u2019s war effort being supported by drones supplied by the United Arab Emirates and flown from bases in nearby Eritrea.

{"title": "Glasgow is the real test of Boris Johnson\u2019s floundering \u2018global Britain\u2019 | Mujtaba Rahman", "article": "When the UK landed the Cop26 presidency two years ago, Boris Johnson sensed a huge opportunity to showcase the UK on the world stage. The conference fit his post-Brexit vision of a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, free of the EU and still a player on the world stage. He believed \u201cGlasgow\u201d would be remembered as a historic gathering, like the previous landmark climate summits in Kyoto and Paris. As recently as the end of September, Johnson told the UN general assembly in New York that the Glasgow summit should be a \u201cturning point\u201d. But then a week ago he began to scale down expectations, admitting success was \u201ctouch and go\u201d. Johnson\u2019s characteristic optimism blinded him to the uphill struggle he still faces. Previous landmark Cops succeeded through strong leadership, top-level political engagement and the hard graft of diplomacy over fine detail. Glasgow can still be a success, but not on the basis of the sort of empty sloganeering that brought us global Britain. Johnson is by nature a proponent of big promises. Initially, it was said, he had toyed with the idea of going further than Paris by beefing up its 1.5C wording. This would be against the wishes of his Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, the former business secretary, who was said to have expressed frustration at Johnson\u2019s overpromising. Johnson is also accused of not engaging fully with Cop26 until relatively late in the day \u2013 in contrast to Laurent Fabius, the former French prime minister who chaired the Paris conference, and Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister who travelled the world before hosting a successful London summit during the financial crisis. Sharma himself was not Johnson\u2019s choice for the role; he had previously approached David Cameron and William Hague. Johnson\u2019s holiday in Spain last month also came at a critical moment in the run-up to Glasgow and raised eyebrows in Whitehall. Senior UK officials insist progress had already been made. Only 30% of the world economy had committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, when the UK took over the rotating Cop presidency, a figure that has risen to 80%. However, the countries signed up to the 1.5C limit account for about 65% of global GDP, leaving a big gap to bridge. Crucially, the UN\u2019s assessment of the nationally determined contributions offered by individual nations shows that they still leave global temperatures on track to rise by 2.7C. Johnson\u2019s critics argue he has been too focused on the 2050 target when he should have put more energy into securing the halving of emissions required by 2030; they are on course to fall by only 7.5%, according to the UN. Some insiders see this as an example of his looking at the big picture rather than mastering the detail. He has also been stymied by poor relations with other world leaders, something that doesn\u2019t bode well for the negotiations in the coming weeks. Brexit has left a legacy of trust issues. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has warned that the dispute with the UK over fishing rights is a test of Johnson\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d on the world stage. In London, this was seen as deliberately timed to embarrass Johnson as he prepared to host Cop26. \u201cHe is trying to rain on our parade,\u201d one Tory MP claimed. And despite the need to win the trust of the poorest countries, the UK\u2019s Cop presidency has been undermined by the government\u2019s controversial decision to trim \u00a34bn a year from overseas aid in the middle of a pandemic. \u201cIt has fuelled the trust problem,\u201d one Whitehall source told me. Another insider admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad advert for global Britain.\u201d Rishi Sunak did not use any of the \u00a350bn at his disposal in last week\u2019s budget to reverse the cut before 2024-25. However, all is not lost for Johnson. His government\u2019s ambitious strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 has passed the credibility test and given him the clout needed to progress-chase at Cop26. In his opening speech this morning, he indulged his flair for the dramatic, warning of a James Bond-like Doomsday Clock set at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d, and that \u201caspirations\u201d must now be matched by \u201caction\u201d. He will point to movement by the rich nations towards their promise to provide $100bn a year to help poor countries cope with climate breakdown, although it will arrive three years late, in 2023. He also expressed hope the summit will agree a landmark deal to halt global deforestation by 2030 and reduce methane emissions by a third by 2030. Not the blockbuster announcements of Paris or Kyoto, but real progress on important details left unfinished by previous summits. This progress depends on many factors coming together. Without more movement by China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, overall momentum will stall. \u201cIndia is unlikely to jump unless China does,\u201d said one UK official. The outcome in Glasgow might depend on the last-minute efforts of John Kerry, the US climate envoy, to extract concessions from China. When Johnson spoke to President Xi Jinping on Friday, he rebuffed the prime minister\u2019s call for China to bring forward its emissions peak from 2030 to 2025. Johnson hopes to be able to argue this summit kept the 1.5C target alive, even while admitting much more needs to be done over the next few years to achieve it. This Cop is one where the big announcements of previous conferences need to be backed up by the concrete details and deals needed to achieve them. This is not really Johnson\u2019s style. But, were he to pull it off, it would be a big achievement for climate politics and a signal that Britain is a responsible global player. One idea being toyed with by the UK government is for world leaders to review progress against targets more frequently, perhaps every year or two years, to ensure more action is taken in the current \u201cdecisive decade\u201d. Cop26 might prove a stepping stone, but the word \u201cGlasgow\u201d is unlikely to be remembered as the triumph for global Britain Johnson hoped for in the heady days of 2019.

{"title": "Boris Johnson will travel home from Cop26 by private plane", "article": "Boris Johnson is flying back from the Cop26 climate conference on a private plane rather than the train after spending two days warning world leaders to reduce their emissions. The prime minister left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after urging other countries to do everything possible to pledge lower emissions and warning that they would be judged by their children if they fail to act. Johnson flew into Cop26 in Glasgow from Rome after attending the G20 of world leaders. But instead of getting the train, which takes about four and a half hours, he has decided to take a short internal flight from Glasgow to London. Earlier, he told a roundtable of leaders of developing nations: \u201cWhen it comes to tackling climate change, words without action, without deeds are absolutely pointless.\u201d The prime minister is one of hundreds of world leaders and businesspeople who have chartered planes to attend the conference aimed at limiting global temperature rises to less than 1.5C. Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, was one of those who flew in to Scotland for the conference. Johnson\u2019s spokesperson defended the move, saying the plane ran partly on \u201csustainable aviation fuel\u201d and emitted about half the emissions of other aircraft. The plane will still cause far more emissions than a trip by train. \u201cIt\u2019s important the PM is able to move around the country. We have obviously faced significant time constraints,\u201d Johnson\u2019s official spokesperson said. The plane \u2013 an Airbus A321 \u2013 appears to have been leased from a company called Titan Airways, while the prime minister\u2019s usual Voyager is being serviced. His spokesperson said: \u201cThe plane is one of the most carbon-efficient planes of its size in the world. It produces 50% less CO2 emissions than, for example, the larger Voyager plane.\u201d Prince Charles also flew from Rome to Glasgow on a private plane separately from the prime minister. It also used sustainable aviation fuel \u2013 a mixture of conventional fuel and biofuel.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/boris-johnson-will-travel-home-from-cop26-by-private-plane", "last_update": "2021-11-02T10:15:55Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Interviewed by the BBC at the climate change gathering in Glasgow, Welby said the stakes at Cop were so high that for the leaders attending, \u201cin two generations\u2019 time they will be remembered for this fortnight, and probably this fortnight alone\u201d. He said: \u201cThey could have been brilliant in everything else they\u2019ve done, and they will be cursed if they don\u2019t get this right. They could have been rubbish at everything else they\u2019ve done.

It will be: people will speak of them in far stronger terms than we speak today of the politicians of the 30s, of the politicians who ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany, because this will kill people all around the world for generations, and we will have no means of averting it.\u201d Asked if he was arguing that a failure to tackle the climate crisis would be worse than not stopping genocide, Welby said: \u201cIt will allow a genocide on an infinitely greater scale. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s grades of genocide, but there\u2019s width of genocide, and this will be genocide indirectly, by negligence, recklessness, that will in the end come back to us or to our children and grandchildren.\u201d But in a subsequent tweet, Welby wrote: \u201cI unequivocally apologise for the words I used when trying to emphasise the gravity of the situation facing us at Cop26. It\u2019s never right to make comparisons with the atrocities brought by the Nazis, and I\u2019m sorry for the offence caused to Jews by these words.\u201d In the interview, Welby was asked what sort of commitments he was seeking from the leaders at Cop26, with the archbishop saying that one key thing was providing sufficient money for developing nations. \u201cAll moral thinking starts with the idea that if you\u2019re going to do the right thing, it needs action: money,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to reach the amounts of money committed \u2013 the $100bn a year \u2013 which is a fraction of what was paid out during the great banking crisis, in 2008-9 \u2013 are they going to reach the amount of money that actually says we\u2019re serious about this?\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/01/justin-welby-apologises-for-likening-climate-threat-to-nazis", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:50:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The new owners are expected to take over on 8 November. The 75-year-old chair and chief executive, Stephen Marks, who co-founded the chain in 1972 and owns nearly 42% of the company, is to receive about \u00a312m for his stake in the business. Apinder Singh Ghura, who in February bought a 25% stake in French Connection from Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, teamed up to buy out the brand with a Manchester-based business partner, Amarjit Singh Grewal, and KJR Brothers, which is led by Rafiq Patel, a textile businessman. Ghura spent years in the clothing industry before shifting to other investments including property and care homes. The French Connection deal comes after the three acquired the Bench fashion brand in March via a group called Wraith Holdings International, one of whose directors is the former Sports Direct executive Peter Wood. Wood also co-owns a group called Apparel Brands with Grewal, which holds distribution rights for revival brands including Bench as well as the 1980s casuals label Farah, and Dunlop, the tennis shoe brand that was once owned by Sports Direct. The takeover deal requires final court approval before shares are expected to cease trading on 5 November.\nGhura said: \u201cWe are delighted with the strong support for the recommended acquisition shown in this morning\u2019s shareholder vote. We look forward to working with French Connection\u2019s management to execute and implement our strategic plans to facilitate the future growth and profitability for the business. \u201cWe must also pay tribute to French Connection founder, Stephen Marks, for his support during the acquisition process.\u201d The consortium face a battle to revive French Connection after years of problems for the brand, which was once highly sought after because of its controversial FCUK branding that launched in the 1990s and ran until the mid-00s. The group has not made a pre-tax profit since 2012 and has suffered from high street pandemic lockdowns. Last month the Financial Reporting Council, an accountancy watchdog, said it was investigating the audit of French Connection\u2019s accounts for the year to January 2020 by the accountancy firm Mazars. French Connection owns the Great Plains and You Must Create (YMC) brands, and operates 67 stores and concessions in the UK.

{"title": "Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea forwards must match threat of wing-backs | Jacob Steinberg", "article": "Thomas Tuchel wants us to think differently. The statistic shows that half Chelsea\u2019s 26 goals in the Premier League and Champions League have come from defenders this season, but Tuchel has an alternative way of viewing the numbers after seeing Reece James rumble up the right flank to score two cracking goals during Saturday\u2019s 3-0 victory at Newcastle. According to the German, the trend is a consequence of the positional freedom he has given to his wing-backs. Tuchel has even come to see Marcos Alonso, Ben Chilwell and James as midfielders rather than defenders and, in any case, it is hardly as if the European champions expected a large portion of their goals to come from the back after spending \u00a397.5m on Romelu Lukaku in the summer.\n\u201cIf you want to reach the highest level in any competition you need consistent goalscoring threat from your strikers,\u201d Tuchel said, speaking as he prepared for Chelsea\u2019s visit to Malm\u00f6 in the Champions League on Tuesday night. \u201cWe hope we can have our strikers at the end of the season on top of the list.\u201d It is a regular refrain from Tuchel, who knew something had to change after Jorginho finished last season as Chelsea\u2019s top scorer in the Premier League, with seven goals. He thought an elite forward was required if Chelsea were going to challenge for the title, and signing Lukaku, who had enjoyed two prolific campaigns for Internazionale, was supposed to be the final piece in the jigsaw. However it has not quite clicked yet for the Belgian, who had four goals from 11 appearances before twisting an ankle during last month\u2019s 4-0 win over Malm\u00f6 at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian will not return until after the international break and, to complicate matters, the hamstrung Timo Werner and the unwell Mason Mount will also be absent against the Swedish champions.\nAt least Christian Pulisic has travelled after a persistent ankle problem. The American winger is a threat in the box and his return is a boost for Tuchel, who started with Kai Havertz, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech in attack against Newcastle. Yet it is not just about the forwards. Chelsea have goals from all over the pitch. James has four, Chilwell has three and Trevoh Chalobah has two. Alonso, Andreas Christensen, Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Thiago Silva have one each. This is a versatile team, notable for R\u00fcdiger\u2019s runs from centre-back, and Tuchel is delighted when he sees Chilwell and James threatening on the flanks. \u201cThe statistic would look a bit different if you maybe interpret the wing-backs more as midfielders,\u201d said the manager, who is without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 because of muscle tightness. \u201cIf you play in a back three it is not really a full-back position and there are more midfield positions.\n\u201cI would not call them defenders. Although they have to defend in some moments they are more free to attack as they have a shorter distance to goal than they would do as a full-back. It is necessary that they are included and that we bring them to the box at the end of our attacks to increase the goal threat. I am happy when we create chances and when we have five or six players in the box to be dangerous.\u201d All the same Chelsea, second in Group H with six points from three games, need more from their forwards. Havertz and Ziyech have to become more consistent and Tuchel wants Hudson-Odoi to push on after three consecutive starts. \u201cIt\u2019s all about performance and this is what Callum shows at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important he shows consistency, stays hungry and keeps progressing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/01/thomas-tuchel-chelseas-forwards-champions-league-malmo", "last_update": "2021-11-01T19:07:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Don't mourn, organise! Politics and poverty have reached the US sitcom - and could change everything | Zoe Williams", "article": "Years and years went by when no one in a novel had a job, and almost no one in a mainstream American sitcom or dramedy had money worries. Roseanne wasn\u2019t earning enough but ever since that show was canned in 1997, people have had cute scrapes where they lost their job or their credit card \u2013 but grinding, day-to-day poverty, unable to make ends meet or imagine a future in which you would ever be able to? That wasn\u2019t what sitcoms were about. Instead, we\u2019d take an office (The Office), or a police precinct (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), or a family (Modern Family), or a dojo (Cobra Kai \u2013 and yes, before you ask, I do watch a lot of telly), and some people would be richer than others, and some would make bad choices, and others would get into hilarious pickles, but one convention was always observed: nobody was struggling, or if they were, it was because they were on drugs. Then came Superstore, created by Justin Spitzer, one of the writers on the American Office. It\u2019s an ensemble piece, about workers on the minimum wage vying to see who can avoid emptying the rat traps and cleaning the unaccountably ubiquitous aisle-vomit in a hangar-scale US supermarket, as hilarious chaos ensues. I didn\u2019t think I could take it at first \u2013 too many primary colours, too heartwarming, too many unlikely romantic pairings. But obviously I could take it, because TV is the only way my kids will ever remain proximal to me for any length of time, because it is a context in which I won\u2019t always be talking. So I sat noncommittally through 10 episodes, to be completely caught off-guard by the season finale. What\u2019s the big answer to the gnawing questions all these personal interactions have thrown up? Join a union. The staff spontaneously unionise, and then the union is busted at the start of season two. It\u2019s all pretty slapstick and reality has remained immutable, yet you can\u2019t help but notice: this show just made a direct pitch for unionisation. And even while it failed, the message was emphatically not: \u201cThat was all a bit silly, wasn\u2019t it, ladies and gentlemen?\u201d The show has now cycled through a number of pressing and impossible questions: how do you survive if you\u2019re an undocumented migrant, it\u2019s illegal to employ you, but you still need to eat? What happens if you drop out of college, owing $200,000, and every day you\u2019re alive, you rack up more debt than you earn? If you injure yourself and can\u2019t afford medical attention, and then you have a long-term suppurating wound the length of one leg, how does that smell? If you live in one of the few societies on earth with no maternity leave entitlement, and yet have the brass neck to have a baby, do you seriously have to turn up to work two days later? If you were ever wondering what it would look like if Ken Loach directed Friends, it\u2019s this. But I never was wondering that, because why would you? Meanwhile, in the mini-series Maid \u2013 an adaptation of a book subtitled Hard Work, Low Pay and a Mother\u2019s Will to Survive \u2013 the lead character\u2019s wages and outgoings flash up on screen throughout the episode to create the constant dread of a mortal enemy, but the big bad is just poverty. It\u2019s not as though any of this is news \u2013 nobody needed Netflix to alert them to wage stagnation. It\u2019s more that, once TV starts to confront reality, it\u2019s hard to see subsequent shows returning to the prelapsarian state of culture where the hardest financial decision a character had to make was whether to buy shoes or go to Hawaii.

{"title": "Narendra Modi pledges India will reach net zero emissions by 2070", "article": "India will meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070, the country\u2019s prime minister has told the Cop26 global climate summit. Speaking at the world leaders\u2019 summit at the UN conference in Glasgow, Narendra Modi made five key pledges for how India would decarbonise over the next few decades. India, a developing country of more than 1.3 billion people, is the world\u2019s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide after the US and China. India was one of the last remaining major economies that had held out on a net zero commitment, despite months of pressure from the US, and Modi\u2019s announcement marked one of the most significant moments of the summit\u2019s opening day. Modi also made significant shorter-term commitments, promising to have 50% of India\u2019s power generated by renewable energy by 2030, increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 and reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030. By 2030, he also committed to a 45% reduction in the carbon intensity of the economy. While the 2070 net zero target falls behind the 2050 commitment made by the US and Europe and the 2060 commitment made by China and Saudi Arabia, it is in line with what many climate experts have modelled as the most feasible scenario for India to achieve net zero. A recent report released by the Delhi-based thinktank the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) put forward 2070 to 2080 as India\u2019s most realistic roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality. \u201cIndia has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world,\u201d said Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of CEEW. \u201cThis is real climate action.\u201d Unlike countries in the west, and even China, India is decades away from its peak in terms of economic growth and energy consumption, and India\u2019s energy demand is expected to grow faster than any other country over the next few years. Its population is also expected to overtake that of China to make it the largest in the world. Currently, 70% of all power in India is generated by coal, and while it is one of the cheapest producers of solar energy in the world, there is still not the technology available to integrate it into the energy grid on a large scale. Advancements in hydrogen technology and storage will also be needed to help India\u2019s industrial sector wean itself off coal, which is unlikely to happen until around 2040, according to experts. India is already bearing the harsh consequences of climate breakdown. Millions across the country are exposed to severe heat, water shortages, extreme weather events such as flooding and coastal erosion, which have all been increasing in recent years. In the build-up to the conference, Indian officials had appeared to rebuff calls to commit to net zero, emphasising instead the need for climate funding and climate justice for developing countries, who historically have emitted far less greenhouses gas than countries such as the US but are now bearing the economic costs that come with net zero commitments.\nThe commitments drew praise from the eminent climate ecologist Nicholas Stern, who said: \u201cThis was a very significant moment for the summit. [The action] might mean that India\u2019s annual emissions of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030. This demonstrates real leadership from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond [and] deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.\u201d In his speech, Modi called out previous commitments of climate finance as \u201chollow\u201d and demanded developed countries make $1tn available as climate finance to developing countries \u201cas soon as possible today\u201d. Modi told his fellow world leaders: \u201cI am sure that the decisions taken in Glasgow will safeguard the future of generations to come and give them a safe and prosperous life.\u201d He apologised for running over his allotted speech time but said he believed it was his \u201cduty to raise my voice for developing countries\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/narendra-modi-pledges-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070", "last_update": "2021-11-01T19:29:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Republican senator Josh Hawley worries feminism has driven men to \u2018pornography and video games\u2019", "article": "The effort to combat toxic masculinity in the US has led men to consume more pornography and play more video games, the Missouri senator Josh Hawley claimed in a speech to a group of Republicans. Speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Florida, Hawley addressed the issue of \u201cmanhood\u201d, which he said was under attack, and called for men to return to traditional masculine roles. The Donald Trump supporter who notoriously raised a fist in support of a mob outside the US Capitol on 6 January appeared to echo talking points made by the likes of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that opposes feminism and believes men are under attack from liberal elites. \u201cCan we be surprised that after years of being told that they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games?\u201d Hawley said. \u201cWhile the left may celebrate this decline of men, I for one cannot join them. No one should.\u201d Hawley, 41, did not cite sources for his belief that men were watching pornography more frequently. Nonetheless, on Monday his speech was republished by the Federalist, a rightwing outlet. In the address, Hawley said he wanted to discuss \u201cthe left\u2019s attempt to give us a world beyond men\u201d. \u201cThe left want to define traditional masculinity as toxic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to define the traditional masculine virtues \u2013 things like courage, and independence, and assertiveness \u2013 as a danger to society.\u201d Hawley is the son of a banker who attended private school before studying at Stanford and Yale. He clerked for the supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, and later became a law professor. Given his background, he has repeatedly raised eyebrows for railing against elites. Hawley\u2019s apparent claim to speak for all men, in the name of a return to a vaguely defined masculinity of old, swiftly became a new subject of ridicule on Twitter.\nHawley, who was a staunch defender of Brett Kavanaugh when he was accused of sexual assault during his supreme court nomination hearings in 2018, claimed: \u201cBoys are increasingly treated like an illness in search of a cure.\u201d \u201cHollywood delivers the toxic masculinity theme ad nauseum in television and film,\u201d he said, going on to link traditional masculinity as \u201cvital to self-government\u201d. \u201cObservers from the ancient Romans to our forefathers identified the manly virtues as indispensable for political liberty,\u201d Hawley said. As well as pornography, Hawley tied the supposed decline in masculinity to issues including unemployment, people marrying at a later age and the preservation of liberty. Hawley said: \u201cFor centuries, lovers of liberty have praised these qualities as the highest standard of manhood. That\u2019s not to say that women don\u2019t possess them. But it is to say that these virtues are the bright side of the aggression and competitiveness and independence that psychologists, no less than philosophers, have long observed in men. \u201cAssertiveness and independence are strengths when used to protect and empower others.\u201d Hawley offered few solutions to the problems he claimed to present. On Monday, he used Twitter to promote his new podcast, co-hosted with his wife. \u201cIn the second episode of This is Living, Josh and Erin Hawley share the story of how they met, what drew them to each other, and how two people so different decided to get married,\u201d a blurb for the podcast reads. The Hawleys met while studying law at Yale. Erin Hawley also clerked for Roberts and became a law professor.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/josh-hawley-feminism-men-pornography-video-games", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:55:50Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Pamela Rose obituary", "article": "Pamela Rose, who has died aged 103, landed her first significant role as an actor on the London stage in 1941, under her maiden name, Pamela Gibson, but it would be another 60 years before she made her West End debut. Instead she took her language skills to the secret wartime codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, where she ran Naval Hut 4\u2019s indexing section. Later, she had little truck with the media glare Bletchley attracted: \u201cIt was something of a disappointment to a young woman and definitely a cushy berth\u201d, but conceded that \u201ca common enemy draws people together like nothing else\u201d. As part of the forces entertainment programme Ensa, Pamela had begun the second world war in a reserved occupation, acting in Bournemouth and then at the Prince of Wales theatre in Birmingham. She was frustrated by Ensa\u2019s below par productions, so it was welcome news that she had been offered her first West End role in Watch on the Rhine. In the meantime came an approach through a family friend: \u201cI know you are doing splendid work entertaining the troops but there is a place where they want girls exactly like you. Here\u2019s the address \u2026\u201d Part of the social network through which Bletchley Park recruited its cohort of civilian women and with good German, Pamela impressed her interviewer, Frank Birch, a thespian-academic working in naval intelligence. Torn between the West End and the prospect of unspecified secret war work she sought Birch\u2019s advice. His answer was unequivocal: \u201cThe stage can wait, the war can\u2019t.\u201d Pamela thought at first that \u201cI was going to be dropped from an aeroplane into Germany. Goodness knows my German wasn\u2019t really good enough for that but one has exalted ideas when one is young.\u201d Her arrival at Bletchley Park was an anticlimax for the 24-year-old, but her utility was not in question. A linguist in the indexing section of Naval Hut 4, she was the recipient of decoded German messages from which all significant information had to be recorded and indexed. It was assiduous work that required a good memory. \u201cRequests for the latest movements of a German battleship had to be accessed and cross-referenced with all other relevant information.\u201d\nPamela was quickly promoted to index leader of this unprecedented data system (pre-microchip and housed on cards) and given the task of managing a clutch of former debutantes who included the wild Jean Campbell-Harris, later Lady Trumpington. She attended section head meetings and was privy to a level of knowledge about the code-breaking nexus that most women were not. Among her female peers, many of whom were just out of school, she made an impression. One Bletchley recruit, Rozanne Colchester, remembered a woman on \u201cthe verge of being a rebel. She was more than stylish, she had her own style. And she was terribly brainy, creative and very quick at picking up languages.\u201d Pamela was born in London into a family in which musical performance was the governing force. Her father, Thornley Gibson, was an opera singer and her mother, Dolly (nee Coit), was also passionate about music. Growing up Pamela recalled PWE \u2013 \u201cpleasant Wednesday evenings\u201d \u2013 when her parents orchestrated musical gatherings on gold chairs and she and her brother were occasionally expected to perform. She was sent off to boarding school aged six, at Broadstairs preparatory school, then Westonbirt school for girls, in Gloucestershire, and elocution lessons reinforced her ambition to become an actor. A self-reliant child, she told herself: \u201cWhatever happens I have always got me. I remember thinking that was quite a comfort.\u201d A reluctant debutante, Pamela left the 1936 season early to cycle to France, where the Moulin Rouge singer Yvette Guilbert taught her French and cabaret performance. Staying in Munich a year later to hone her German, with characteristic candour she later said: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I don\u2019t think I was aware of the ghastly things that were going on. I was like so many young people, preoccupied with myself. I wanted to get back to London and act.\u201d She enrolled on a Webber Douglas course and did just that, and even at Bletchley Park channelled her acting into theatrical revues. \u201cI directed Candida, by George Bernard Shaw. I didn\u2019t want anything too experimental; we had to bear in mind the ability of the actors.\u201d She might have returned to the stage after the war but meeting Wing Commander Jim Rose at the Park changed that. They married in 1946. After the war, Jim became a journalist and founded the International Press Institute in the 1950s. Pamela recalled that he told her: \u201c\u2018If you go back on the stage you\u2019ll be going out to work just as I am coming in\u2019 so I gave up acting. I wanted to spend my life with Jim and I thought you can\u2019t have everything. I doubt I would\u2019ve thought like that now but one is conditioned by the way others think and I was a product of my time.\u201d She ran a mentoring scheme for African-Caribbean children in a London comprehensive school, was vice-chair of the NSPCC and served as chair of the Stroke Association. Jim died in 1999, and she finally appeared on the West End stage later that year, in Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan. \u201cIt was terrifying but great fun and it helped subdue the grief.\u201d I met her while writing The Bletchley Girls (2015) and that year she appeared as a castaway on Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs, aged 97. She attributed her long life to \u201cluck, optimism and a great belief in the human spirit\u201d. Pamela is survived by her daughter, Harriet, and son, Alan, five grandchildren, Chloe, Charlotte, Matthew, Clare and Hannah, and six great-grandchildren. \u2022 Pamela Rose, wartime indexer and actor, born 29 November 1917; died 17 October 2021", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/pamela-rose-obituary", "last_update": "2021-11-02T18:38:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Right before its collapse, the token\u2019s value had spiked to $2,856. The token\u2019s website and social accounts have disappeared, along with a white paper describing Squid. The token was made available for purchase on 20 October with the idea that the cryptocurrency would be a pay-to-play token to play an online game, inspired by Squid Game, the hit series in which heavily indebted people play deadly versions of children\u2019s games to win cash. The game was set to launch in November and its promoters said winners would be rewarded with more Squid tokens. But even as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price spiked in value last week, many noted that the token could be fraudulent. Investors were having trouble selling their tokens and the cryptocurrency\u2019s white paper was laden with grammatical errors, according to multiple reports. The creators of the cryptocurrency could have made off with as much as $2.1m after the token\u2019s crash, according to Gizmodo. CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency price-tracking website, warned potential buyers before the crash of the cryptocurrency\u2019s possibly fraudulent nature, telling investors to \u201cplease do your own due diligence and exercise caution while trading\u201d and warning them that investors were having trouble selling their tokens.

{"title": "Cop26: Biden urges action on climate change and vows US will \u2018lead by example\u2019", "article": "Joe Biden has warned that the climate crisis poses \u201cthe existential threat to human existence as we know it\u201d and urged other world leaders to embark upon a transformational shift to clean energy, as questions linger over the US president\u2019s ability to deliver this vision at home.\nBiden, addressing a sparse chamber at crucial UN climate talks that have begun in a frigid and drizzly Glasgow, said that the conference must act as a \u201ckickoff of a decade of ambition and innovation to preserve our shared future\u201d. The president added: \u201cWe meet with the eyes of history upon us. Will we do what is necessary? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?\u201d Biden\u2019s administration is attempting to reassert America\u2019s credibility at the gathering of nearly 200 countries in Scotland, known as Cop26, after Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US from the Paris climate agreement and his dismissal of climate science. Scientists have warned the world is badly off track to avoid disastrous climate change, with leaders of poorer, vulnerable countries using the talks to warn their populations face looming cataclysm. \u201cWe will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example,\u201d Biden said in his speech, in a tacit acknowledgement of Trump. \u201cI know it hasn\u2019t been the case, which is why my administration is working overtime to show our climate commitment is action not words.\u201d \u201cRight now, we are falling short, there\u2019s no time to hang back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves,\u201d the president continued. \u201cThis is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases.\u201d Biden said that wealthy, major polluters such as the US have an \u201coverwhelming responsibility\u201d to aid smaller countries that are struggling to cope with growing floods, fires and heatwaves spurred by global heating. Before arriving in Glasgow, Biden also took aim at some other leading emitters for not doing enough to prevent global heating surpassing 1.5C. He said these countries are \u201cnot only Russia but China (which) basically didn\u2019t show up in terms of commitments to deal with climate change. I found it disappointing myself\u201d. At a side event, Biden also effectively apologized for his predecessor. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t apologize, but I do apologize for the fact that the United States \u2013 the last administration \u2013 pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball,\u201d Biden said. But climate activists, many of whom gathered outside the Glasgow venue that hosted more than 120 world leaders on Monday, argue that Biden is failing to live up to his own words. The president touted vast proposed climate legislation that would be the \u201cmost significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made, ever,\u201d but the bill remains stalled in Congress, after being winnowed away by a senator who has extensive ties to fossil fuels. \u201cBiden is at Glasgow empty handed, with nothing but words on paper,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise Movement. \u201cIt is humiliating and fails to meet the moment that we\u2019re in.\u201d Biden has also been attacked over his administration\u2019s reluctance to drastically scale back oil and gas drilling in the US. The president\u2019s narrative of \u201cclimate leadership\u201d contradicts the daily suffering by communities on the frontline of gas and oil production in the US, activists say. In the first six months of the Biden administration, about 2,500 new oil and gas permits were authorized \u2013 a figure Trump\u2019s administration took a year to reach. Speakers outside Cop26 on Monday \u2013 only 23 civil society observers were allowed in to hear the leaders\u2019 speeches \u2013 included Black and Indigenous leaders whose communities are on the frontline of fossil fuel extraction impacts, including air pollution and contaminated drinking water and land across the US. Tom Goldtooth, Native American leader from the Indigenous Environmental Network, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here as the original people of the US to denounce the polluters conference \u2013 it\u2019s not a climate conference \u2013 it\u2019s been taken over by corporate interests. If we Indigenous people don\u2019t come we\u2019ll be on the menu. We\u2019re here to defend our people, we want to live.\u201d Biden\u2019s speech came shortly after an official opening of Cop26 that acknowledged the growing anguish over the escalating, and largely unchecked, climate crisis. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said \u201cthe people who will judge us are children not yet born\u201d, adding \u201cif we fail they will not forgive us\u201d.

{"title": "Restaurant offers budget version of Salt Bae\u2019s gold-covered steak ", "article": "If you have more money than sense, spending \u00a3850 on a gold-covered steak at a Knightsbridge restaurant is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. If you have more sense than money, then head to Durham or Sunderland. The breathtakingly expensive gold tomahawk steaks sold in the celebrity-packed restaurants of Nusret G\u00f6k\u00e7e, known as Salt Bae, have attracted many headlines and a fair degree of mockery. For John Stirk, a butcher and steakhouse owner, it prompted exasperation. \u201cI love it when people post pictures of the food they\u2019ve had and give us a good review. What annoys me about the restaurant in London is that there\u2019s a lot more pictures of people posting receipts for how much they\u2019ve paid for the food rather than the quality.\u201d An example that went viral was a \u00a337,023.10 receipt from the recently opened London branch of Bae\u2019s Nusr-Et steakhouse chain. Top of the food bill was the \u00a3850 golden tomahawk. Stirk\u2019s team have created their own version of the steak, which has been added to the menu at his restaurants in Belmont, near Durham, and Sunderland. It feeds two and it costs \u00a3100. \u201cThis time last year people couldn\u2019t afford to feed their kids and now social media is full of receipts for how much they\u2019ve spent at a restaurant,\u201d said Stirk. \u201cIt just feels wrong. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me. \u201cFor me it was about showing that the gold-covered steak could be done cheaper and could be done better. It doesn\u2019t have to cost the earth.\u201d Stirk said he was not saying \u00a3100 was cheap. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you go out and have for your tea.\u201d But if it was a special occasion, people might consider it, said Stirk, who has been surprised at how popular the golden steaks have been at his steakhouses. \u201cThe reaction has been out of this world. We sold about 30 over the weekend. The sentiment behind it wasn\u2019t about putting a gold, flashy steak on our menu, it was about quality of food.\u201d\nStirk, a former contestant on the BBC show Young Butcher of the Year, is not alone in taking on Salt Bae. Gareth Mason, the head chef at Absolute bar and bistro in Westhoughton, Bolton, covered his signature whist pies in 24-carat gold to mock the \u201cludicrous\u201d Salt Bae steak. Also covered in gold were carrots, chips and sausage and bacon butties. \u201cIt\u2019s more Morecambe Bay than Salt Bae,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the traditional Lancashire dishes covered in gold for a fraction of the price you\u2019d pay at his restaurant.\u201d As well as Stirk Bae and Morecambe Bae there has been Plant Bae, courtesy of the vegan food company THIS, which set up a food truck outside the Knightsbridge Nusr-Et restaurant handing out free vegan rolls. Andy Shovel, co-founder of THIS, said: \u201cWe felt sorry for all these people turning up for a nice meal and then being whacked with a massive bill.

{"title": "Did you solve it? The playful genius of Hungarian puzzles", "article": "Earlier today I set you the following \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d logic puzzles, a genre thought to have emerged decades ago in Hungary. (For more details about the Hungarian link here\u2019s the story.) The idea is that the solution is mapped out on a three-dimensional grid. 1. Date night Andy, Bill, Chris, and Daniel are out tonight with their dates, Emily, Fran, Gina, and Huong. We have the following information. 1. Andy will go to the opera 2. Bill will spend the evening with Emily, 3. Chris would not want to go out with Gina, 4. Fran will see a movie 5. Gina will attend a workshop. We also know that one couple will see an art exhibit. Who will go out with whom, and what will they do? Solution Here\u2019s what I hoped you would do, which is to draw a 3D grid like the one below with the four alternatives on each axis. It\u2019s as if you are looking at cube directly at a corner, showing three faces.\nOnce you have the grid, you go through the statements, inputting the information where you can. Statement 1 says that Andy goes to the opera. So you put a tick for Andy/opera, which appears on the right face of the cube. We need to assume that each date takes place in one location, so we can mark crosses in the cells Andy/movie, Andy/workshop and Andy/art, since we know he didn\u2019t go to any of those places. Bill, Chris and Daniel don\u2019t go to the opera, so the corresponding cells also gain an X. Statement 2 says that Bill goes with Emily, so the top face will get a tick in the cell for Bill/Emily. If you continue in this way, you will fill up the grid with ticks and crosses. Each face will have four ticks only, and none of these ticks will share the same row or column. Finally, you will reach the conclusion that Andy and Huong attend the opera, Bill and Emily hang out at the art exhibit, Chris and Fran enjoy a movie, and Daniel and Gina go wild at the workshop. 2. Condo conundrum When Mr and Mrs Verona opened the door to their condominium at 11am this morning, they saw a terrible sight: their beautiful home had been burgled. They called the police, who came over immediately. The upcoming investigation revealed the following. 1. There are six condominiums in the building, numbered 1 to 6, the Veronas owned #4. 2. The Veronas left their home at 6pm last night. 3. The night guard of the building, Mr. Safe, works from 6pm till 10am. 4. There were six visitors in the building during last night: Mr A. Bream, Miss F. Green, Mr R. Hill, Dr T. Smith, Miss T. Taylor, and Mr Z. White. They all visited one of the six condominiums, each a different one, some time between 6pm and midnight. Mr. Safe could not recall, however, who visited which place; but he was sure that none of them stayed longer than an hour. Furthermore, they all stayed during different hours; the first one between 6pm and 7pm, the second between 7pm and 8pm, and so on. 5. Mr Bream was at a huge party at the country club. He arrived there at 8pm and stayed till midnight. 6. Miss Green was also at the country club; she arrived at 9pm and left with Mr Bream. 7. Mr Hill could not provide any credible alibi for the night before. 8. Miss Taylor was at her home watering her front yard between 7.45pm and 9pm. Several of her neighbors saw her. 9. Mr White was at the party at the country club. He arrived at 7pm and left at 10pm but, surprisingly, he came back again at 11pm and stayed till after midnight. 10. No one could enter the condominium without going through the lobby where Mr. Safe was stationed. 11.

{"title": "Kane, midfield and recruitment: key challenges facing Tottenham | Ed Aarons", "article": "Re-establish the team\u2019s identity It been nearly two years since Mauricio Pochettino was dismissed after an awful start to the 2019-20 season yet Tottenham have never really moved on from the manager who had led them to the Champions League final a few months earlier. Five of the side that started against Liverpool in Madrid remain at the club \u2013 Hugo Lloris, Harry Winks, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Harry Kane \u2013 but neither Jos\u00e9 Mourinho nor Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was able to establish their imprint on a squad created by Pochettino and weakened by poor recruitment. The expected appointment of Antonio Conte is a statement of intent given the Italian\u2019s vast experience of finding a winning formula, albeit often only in the short term. He demands that players stick to his plan; anyone who does not quickly finds themselves out in the cold.\nIntroduce a new formation Conte usually favours a three-man defence with wing-backs \u2013 a system that has brought him league titles at Juventus, Chelsea and Internazionale. Nuno, during his brief spell in charge of Spurs, opted against a similar approach that served him so well at Wolves, but adapting to the likely change of formation will be crucial to Tottenham\u2019s recovery. Whether Conte would be able to mould a solid backline from Cristian Romero, Eric Dier, Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Joe Rodon remains to be seen, although there are two potentially exciting wing-backs in Sergio Reguil\u00f3n and Emerson Royal, even if both will be under pressure to improve their defensive performances. Strengthen midfield and finally replace Eriksen Tottenham\u2019s main issue under Nuno was a lack of creativity in midfield: no club averages fewer shots per game in the Premier League and neither Alli nor Son has created a scoring chance. Finding an effective partner for Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg in midfield and a creative outlet to finally replace Christian Eriksen, who joined Inter in January 2020, will be two of the most important challenges for Spurs. The Denmark international racked up 62 assists and 51 goals at the club and has not been replaced effectively, with Giovani Lo Celso, Tanguy Ndombele and Alli so far failing to step into his shoes. It will be intriguing to see whether Lo Celso, who has shown glimpses of his ability since arriving from Real Betis a few months before Pochettino\u2019s sacking, can thrive under the new manager and whether there is any role for the other two.\nGet recruitment right Conte and Tottenham\u2019s managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, enjoyed spectacular success in three seasons together at Juventus between 2011 and 2014 that yielded three Serie A titles and a record 102 points in the manager\u2019s final campaign. Their relationship has been a key factor in attracting the 52-year-old former Italy manager for talks with Spurs and Conte would expect his compatriot to be on his side if it comes to discussing transfer budgets with a notoriously prudent chairman. Tottenham\u2019s net spend over the past five seasons is \u00a394.6m \u2013 one of the lowest in the Premier League \u2013 but the new manager will surely demand more investment, with several targets earmarked for January and Daniel Levy likely to come under pressure to match his manager\u2019s ambition. Restore Harry Kane\u2019s desire The hangover from a summer of doubt over the England captain\u2019s future seeped into the start of the season and appears still to be affecting Kane. His return of one goal from nine Premier League appearances is partly down to the negative approach under Nuno and a lack of opportunities created by teammates but Tottenham\u2019s star player has looked demotivated at times. In the short term, Kane will relish the opportunity of working with a manager who has made winning trophies a habit. But with less than three years remaining on the 28-year-old\u2019s contract and with Kane having made no secret of his desire to leave for Manchester City, time is against Spurs to persuade Kane that the grass isn\u2019t always greener.\nWin a trophy The drought that stretches back to 2008 and six permanent managers since Juande Ramos led Spurs to victory over Chelsea in the League Cup is always mentioned when a new face arrives. Coming through a tricky Carabao Cup quarter-final against West Ham in December could be Tottenham\u2019s best chance of a trophy this season after defeat by Manchester City in the 2020-21 final and the club will expect to go further than the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2018. The new manager\u2019s approach to the Europa Conference League may not be so warm. The new tournament could be viewed as one distraction too many. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2021 to remove a reference to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho being manager of Tottenham for the 2020-21 Carabao Cup final.

{"title": "Lobbyist at firm with close ties to Tories will help select Ofcom chair", "article": "A lobbyist at a company with close connections to the Conservative party will help select the next chair of the media regulator, it has been announced, after ministers cleared the former Daily Mail editor to apply for the job for a second time. Michael Prescott, a former political editor of the Sunday Times, has been unveiled as the senior external interviewer who will work with the veteran civil servant Sue Gray to decide which candidates should be approved. Prescott is currently a senior executive at Hanover Communications, a company founded by John Major\u2019s former director of communications which is regularly used as a recruiting ground for Conservative special advisers. His appointment was confirmed as ministers relaunched the recruitment process for a new individual to oversee Ofcom \u2013 but only after tweaking the job description to favour a more confrontational candidate. Paul Dacre has been Downing Street\u2019s preferred choice to oversee Ofcom since last summer but unexpectedly flunked his interview on the first attempt in May. The original panel believed he did not fulfil the required criteria for the \u00a3142,500 a year, three-day-a-week role running the board of the media regulator. Rather than accept a different candidate who did pass the vetting process, ministers instead decided to rerun the entire recruitment process to give Dacre a second shot. Five months later, after struggling to find people to help run the interview process, ministers have finally readvertised the role. The new job description for Ofcom chair has been amended to describe a more confrontational candidate. Originally the successful applicant for the role was required to prove their commitment to working \u201ccollegiately\u201d with fellow board members and show they could build a \u201cpositive relationship\u201d with the Ofcom chief executive, Melanie Dawes. This time around, the successful applicant only has to commit to working \u201ceffectively\u201d with fellow board members and show they could have a \u201cproductive relationship\u201d with the chief executive. The requirement for the Ofcom chair to \u201csupport the chief executive\u201d has also been replaced with the lesser requirement to \u201cchallenge\u201d the chief executive and only give them \u201cappropriate support\u201d. The new job advert has removed a requirement for the successful candidate to \u201cbe the most senior representative and ambassador of Ofcom\u201d. In addition, the need for first-hand \u201cfamiliarity\u201d with the world of regulation has also been replaced with a requirement for a lesser \u201cunderstanding\u201d of regulation. Ministers will have the final say on who gets to oversee Ofcom, with the final candidate required to attend a hearing of the House of Commons culture select committee before the appointment is confirmed. That committee is led by Julian Knight, who has previously said Dacre should not be allowed to reapply for the job after failing on the first attempt. Any member of the public can apply for the position of Ofcom chair if they think they meet the criteria, although the last time it was advertised only nine people put their names forward after it was made clear the government wanted Dacre. Prescott was approach for comment and a government spokesperson responded on his behalf. They said: \u201cThe recruitment process for the Ofcom chair is fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest. Mr Prescott\u2019s role on the panel has been approved by the independent Commissioner for Public Appointments.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/nov/01/lobbyist-at-firm-with-close-ties-to-tories-will-help-select-ofcom-chair", "last_update": "2021-11-01T20:52:38Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Talking Horses: Europe\u2019s best head to Breeders\u2019 Cup amid Bob Baffert saga | Greg Wood", "article": "The big names over the jumps are emerging week by week and Cheltenham\u2019s November meeting is on the horizon but the international Flat season has one final flourish to come. The pulling power of Del Mar on the Pacific coast in California \u2013 \u201cwhere the surf meets the turf\u201d \u2013 has attracted a huge European team for the 2021 Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting later this week. More detail about running plans will arrive when the draw for stall positions takes place later on Monday, but the quarantine barn at Del Mar is currently home to 40 horses from stables in Europe. They include Dermot Weld\u2019s Tarnawa, who will attempt to become only the third dual winner of the Turf, and Audarya from James Fanshawe\u2019s Newmarket yard, who defends her title in the Filly & Mare Turf.\nThe Group One winners Love, Glass Slippers, Teona and Mother Earth are also engaged on the main card on Saturday \u2013 which means that half a dozen fillies and mares are the team leaders this weekend \u2013 while the juvenile events on turf on Friday\u2019s card are also packed with European challengers. Hello You (Juvenile Fillies Turf) and Go Bears Go (Juvenile Turf Sprint) are due to line up in the increasingly familiar purple colours of football agent Kia Joorabchian, while Dubawi Legend, the runner-up to Europe\u2019s champion two-year-old Native Trail in the Dewhurst last time, is among several live contenders for the Juvenile Turf. The Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s claim to be the \u201cworld championships\u201d of racing may still grate with some on the other side of the Atlantic but it is, by a country mile, as close as we are ever likely to get. As the most valuable meeting in what is still the world\u2019s biggest racing industry, its significance is also understood by international Flat racing\u2019s biggest players. The longstanding, entirely justified complaints about race-day medication should also now be a thing of the past, as this will be the first Breeders\u2019 Cup at which all 14 races are Lasix-free.\nWhile one potential source of controversy has been addressed, another remains in the unmistakable form of the trainer Bob Baffert. The controversy over Medina Spirit\u2019s failed drug test after winning the Kentucky Derby in May has slipped down the news agenda somewhat over the last few months, but the situation is still unresolved and Medina Spirit himself is a contender for Saturday\u2019s $7m Classic. The British Horseracing Authority has often been criticised for the glacial speed of its disciplinary procedures, but the Medina Spirit case is becoming a \u201chold my beer\u201d moment for racing in the US. As yet, nearly six months on from the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit has not been disqualified for testing positive for betamethasone, a banned steroid. Baffert\u2019s struggle to avoid a DQ for Medina Spirit has disappeared into the rabbit hole of America\u2019s legal system. It is anyone\u2019s guess when a decision might finally emerge. The trainer claims that the positive test was down to inadvertent use of an ointment for a skin complaint, having initially suggested it may have been contaminated by a stable hand urinating in the horse\u2019s box.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Breeders\u2019 Cup approved Baffert to run horses at this year\u2019s meeting two weeks ago, while imposing strict conditions on his runners, including tighter out-of-competition testing in the run-up to the meeting and heightened security at this barn. In addition to Medina Spirit, Baffert\u2019s runners are expected to include Gamine, the defending champion in the Filly & Mare Sprint and another horse with a chequered medication record. She was disqualified from third place in the Kentucky Oaks in September 2020 after testing positive for betamethasone, which is permitted for use in racing stables as an anti-inflammatory, but with a recommended withdrawal period of 14 days before a race to ensure that it has left the horse\u2019s system. At a meeting which is always thick with plotlines, this is the one that the Breeders\u2019 Cup could have done without. But it does at least guarantee the eyes of the racing world will be firmly focused on Del Mar throughout the meeting as one of the sport\u2019s biggest events unfolds on the Californian coastline. Breeders\u2019 Cup draw adds complications Several of the leading European contenders for the Breeders\u2019 Cup at Del Mar in California this weekend were handed tricky outside draws when the final fields for the $31m meeting were drawn on Monday. Tarnawa, the defending champion in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf, will start from stall 13 in a 14-strong field, while Teona, the Prix Vermeille winner, is on her immediate inside in 12. Tarnawa\u2019s hold-up running style should give her a fair chance to show her best form, however, even around Del Mar\u2019s tight turf track, and she remains a clear favourite at a top price of 7-4, with Teona on offer at 7-1. Audarya, the defending champion in Saturday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly & Mare Turf, will also start from a wide stall as she attempts to become the first horse to win the race in consecutive years. James Fanshawe\u2019s mare is in 12 and edged out to 5-1 (from 9-2) with Coral as a result. Kevin Ryan\u2019s Glass Slippers, the defending champion in Saturday\u2019s Turf Sprint, drew stall one, alongside stable companion Emaraaty Ana (2) and likely favourite Golden Pal (3). Glass Slippers is 13-2 (from 9-1) with Coral, while Emaraaty Ana is 5-1 (from 11-2). The main contenders from British stables in Friday\u2019s Juvenile Turf ended up on opposite sides of the track, as Dubawi Legend, the runner-up behind Native Trail in the Dewhurst Stakes last month, drew widest of all in 14 while Modern Games and Albahr, from Charlie Appleby\u2019s Newmarket yard, will start from stalls one and two respectively. Dubawi Legend, the most obvious loser among the big European team after the draw, was pushed out to 9-2 (from 3-1) with Paddy Power, while Modern Games is now the new favourite at a top price of 4-1.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/talking-horses-breeders-cup-bob-baffert-saga-racing", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:41:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},

They permanently complain about the manifest iniquities of business rates, but completely fail to grasp the obvious alternative despite it being regularly set out and available for more than a hundred years (Retailers warn budget will cause \u2018unnecessary loss\u2019 of jobs and shops, 27 October). Very simply \u2013 one taxes land, not property. When one reads of property prices rising it is not that bricks and mortar have increased in value but the land. Why? Because they stopped making it aeons ago and its supply is limited. Also, the value of a site is largely dependent on the planning permission it holds, ie the decision of the public authority. The value of my house in Leeds is double what it would be if one applied general inflation rather than land value inflation. Why should I have this potential windfall? If a business increases its profitability it is penalised by an increase in its business rate, whereas taxing land encourages its profitable use as its valuation is on its \u201cmaximum permitted use\u201d. Furthermore, taxing property encourages huge enterprises and many public utilities to hold land banks for future use because they pay nothing in rates. Taxing land values discourages such unprofitable holdings and encourages their use. Spreading the tax base reduces the rate of tax charged. The practicalities of valuing land are relatively straightforward, even with transitional arrangements during a changeover. The switch lacks only the political will to introduce it. It became Liberal party policy in 1893 and Lloyd George put it into his radical 1909 budget, only to see it defeated in the Lords. It is high time the Confederation of British Industry, Chambers of Commerce and other organisations for business stopped mere complaining and put all their weight behind this much overdue change. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 In the rush (including from the opposition) to redress the apparent iniquity represented by business rates, I haven\u2019t seen any suggestions for making up the consequent shortfall in income for already cash-strapped local authorities.

{"title": "\u2018I wish I\u2019d voted to stay in\u2019: Brixham fishers on the cost of Brexit", "article": "Ian Perkes knows better than most the post-Brexit vision that was sold to the fishing industry by the Vote Leave team and the now prime minister, Boris Johnson. Looking out over Brixham harbour from his office, the fish merchant recalls meeting Johnson in August 2019, less than six months before the UK ended its membership of the European Union. \u201cHe\u2019s telling me we\u2019re going to have to take on extra staff because we\u2019re going to be so busy,\u201d Perkes says. \u201cWith all this free trade, they\u2019re going to want our fish.\u201d Asked how he now views the prime minister, he pauses. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he replies bitterly. \u201cHe never mentioned the extra costs.\u201d To Perkes and others in the Brixham fishing industry, the current dispute with France over the number of licences issued to French fishermen to operate in UK waters is the latest in a long line of issues to hit business after Brexit. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t any Brexit, there wouldn\u2019t be any issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were getting on fine before that.\u201d But Perkes surprises with a key admission \u2013 he voted to leave the EU. \u201cI\u2019ve been trolled since I first revealed this \u2013 but I wish I had voted to stay in. I never realised we were going to incur all these costs. We were told it was going to be free trade.\u201d Brexit created mountains of paperwork for Perkes and his industry peers. He says sales are down and costs are up, and it\u2019s all down to the departure from the EU. And the latest fight \u2013 with the French threatening to blockade their ports, is adding to their woes. \u201cIt does impact Brixham,\u201d he said. \u201cThey start blockading the port, we\u2019re not going to be able to send fish.\u201d But despite his regrets, he believes the way forward is for the UK to \u201ctoughen up\u201d its stance towards France. \u201cThey want to bring their wines and cheeses and delicacies into the UK? Let\u2019s make it tougher for them,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put tariffs on it. Let\u2019s stop Citroen and Renault bringing cars in. Let\u2019s make it difficult, as difficult as they\u2019re making it for us. Because it can work both ways.\u201d\nMorris Reid, a skipper on the Margaret Anne, a scallop boat, said a blockade at the French ports could potentially see them lose up to \u00a320,000 every few days. But he believes if Brexit had not happened, the industry would still be facing one dispute or another. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. The French, if you look at the charter and how the quota is broken down \u2026 have got about 90% of the quota \u2026 it just seems they want more and more and more,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all for the votes. There\u2019s an election in France after Christmas. Macron is just trying to get the votes. It\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into it. If they blockade the ports, we\u2019ll put more stuff through Holland.\u201d \u201cBoris Johnson needs to grow a backbone and just say enough\u2019s enough. We should start blocking the harbours, see how they like it. It\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s a very tight timeline. If scallops are held up 24 hours, they will spoil.\u201d\nLowic Farnham, 31, the skipper of the fishing boat Sanderling, has relocated from Jersey to Brixham because of the wider implications of Brexit. \u201cSince Brexit, we\u2019ve been shafted,\u201d he said. Previously, Jersey fishers could head straight into French ports, but since Brexit they are required to return to Jersey, narrowing the window in which they can fish. He now finds himself living on his small boat, and his wife and children are back in Jersey. He doesn\u2019t expect to see them again until Christmas. \u201cI can see over here how they feel [about EU membership], but in Jersey it should never have affected us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to vote. We\u2019ve been sucked up into it. I wish things had stayed as they were. I need to support my family. If I don\u2019t fish, I don\u2019t get any money. Brexit put so many more restrictions. Too many variables.\u201d\nOthers are more optimistic. Mending nets on the harbourside on a sunny Monday morning, Wesley Lowland says it is true that costs have risen, but so has the price of fish. \u201cShellfish [trade] is suffering, but I\u2019m not worried.

{"title": "Jes Staley: account of relationship with Epstein comes under scrutiny", "article": "When it was revealed last year that Jes Staley had sailed his luxury yacht to a meeting with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on his private Caribbean island, the Barclays boss told colleagues he was \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d. But on Monday Staley resigned as chief executive of Barclays after the board said it had been made aware of the preliminary conclusions of an investigation by City regulators into how he had characterised his relationship with Epstein to Barclays. Staley intends to contest the report\u2019s findings. Staley\u2019s relationship with Epstein \u2013 who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking underage girls \u2013 had dragged Barclays into a reputational crisis that one of its largest investors said led to a \u201cdestabilising situation, which has become a circus\u201d. The activist investor Sherborne Investors, run by Edward Bramson, last year formally called on the board to remove Staley, 64, as CEO \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Staley survived the attempted ousting, even though it followed hot on the heels of a scandal in which Staley had ordered his staff to launch a transatlantic investigation to try to unmask a whistleblower. Now his character and the transparency surrounding Epstein are under examination by regulators, who are comparing the version of events Staley shared with Barclays\u2019 board (and the bank in turn shared with investigators) with a trove of emails that Staley\u2019s former employer, the US bank JP Morgan, has handed to the authorities. \u201cObviously I thought I knew him well, and I didn\u2019t. For sure, with hindsight, with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey,\u201d Staley said last year, adding that he had been \u201cvery transparent\u201d with investigators, who he said were focusing on his \u201ctransparency and openness with the bank\u201d. Staley had known Epstein since at least 2000, when he was the boss of JP Morgan\u2019s private bank and Epstein was one of his most valued ultra-wealthy clients. He has said his relationship with Epstein started to \u201ctaper off\u201d when he left JP Morgan in 2013. However, in April 2015, Staley and his wife, Deby, sailed to Epstein\u2019s private island, Little St James, in the US Virgin Islands, on their 91ft wenge wood yacht Bequia. Staley describes Bequia, which is named after the Caribbean island on which the couple spent their honeymoon, as \u201cnot a big yacht, but it is a big boat\u201d. While the yacht was designed primarily for relaxed cruising, Staley sailed it across the Atlantic to complete one of his \u201cbucket list\u201d life goals, and won the Loro Piana Superyacht regatta in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, in 2013. Staley was born in Boston, and remains an avid Red Sox fan, but moved cities frequently during his childhood because of his father\u2019s job at PQ Corporation, a chemicals company. Barclays has agreed to pay for relocation costs if he moves back to the US, where he owns an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan and a house in Southampton, the Long Island playground of the Wall Street elite. Friends have described Staley as not your typical brash, boastful investment banker, but a sensitive, reflective and respectful soul who concentrates on building strong teams around him rather than bullying subordinates. Staley, who was christened James but has been known since childhood as Jes, joined a forerunner of JP Morgan straight after graduating from Bowdoin College, Maine, with a degree in economics in 1979.

{"title": "Higher education\u2019s casual approach to employment | Letters", "article": "In your article \u2018My students never knew\u2019: the lecturer who lived in a tent (30 October) several workers in higher education share their stories of extreme precarity, including a young woman who had so little money she had to live in a tent while doing her PhD. Instead of expressing empathy and a commitment to address the brutal reality of insecure work, the Universities and Colleges Employers\u2019 Association (UCEA) responded by downplaying the amount of casualisation in this sector, and attacking the University and College Union (UCU) with the claim that we have \u201crepeatedly reject[ed] opportunities to work with employers in this important area\u201d. This disappointing response reveals the dismissive attitude that the employers\u2019 representatives bring to collective bargaining. Since the UCU was created, we have campaigned and reported on the shameful stain of precarity in higher education: currently, 68% of research-only academics are on fixed-term contracts, as are 44% of teaching-only staff, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. We have always striven to work with employers in this area, via collective bargaining. When they feel ready to join us to discuss serious proposals, they will have our full attention.

Age: The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, to do experiments with gases in his lab. Now more commonly associated with celebration than science though, right? Correct. No children\u2019s party is complete without them. A bunch of them tied to a door are a reassuring indication that this is the house where the party is taking place. Also, people sometimes use them to take drugs, no? Apparently so. Nitrous oxide \u2013 AKA laughing gas or nos \u2013 is transferred from those silver canisters you see all over the place into balloons and then inhaled by people wanting to feel giddy, giggly or euphoric. Adults do use balloons more innocently as well, though. They are all over Instagram. It is indeed the latest celebrity trend: an extravagant display of balloons, often in an arch, the bigger and bolder the better, to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, anything really. Examples please. Made in Chelsea\u2019s Millie Mackintosh, Love Island\u2019s Amy Hart, Harry Kane \u2026 The former footballer? Stop it! Harry, the current Tottenham and England striker, and his wife, Katie, hosted their gender reveal party under a tasteful pastel balloon arch. Don\u2019t tell me, Harry then tried to kick one through the arch but missed from half a yard? Enough, leave him alone. So anyway, what\u2019s the deal, balloons are in, everyone loves balloons? Actually, not everyone. Who doesn\u2019t? Seabirds and other wildlife. Also, Danielle Vosburgh, co-founder of Balloons Blow, a group that educates people about the destructive effects released balloons have on animals, people and the environment. Discarded and badly disposed-of balloons don\u2019t just pollute, they can kill animals that ingest them. A 2019 study found that balloon debris is the material most likely to kill marine birds, including albatrosses. I\u2019m feeling that balloon bubble bursting. \u201cBalloons are a wasteful single-use product that quickly become rubbish,\u201d said Vosburgh. Balloonacy, you might say. I blame that Nena. Nena? Ninety-nine red balloons, floating in the summer sky \u2026 But hang on, isn\u2019t latex biodegradable? That\u2019s what the balloon industry wants you to think. Truth is, it can take a couple of years. And, if you\u2019re a choking gannet, you don\u2019t have a couple of years \u2026 OK, OK, I\u2019m out, no more balloons. Boo to balloons. Pop!

He writes: \u201cThis is a country that cherishes its history and its traditions.\u201d I would say it\u2019s a country that cherishes its English history. I went to school in Northern Ireland; our A-level history syllabus (in the 1950s) had two strands: \u201cBritish\u201d and \u201cModern European\u201d. The former contained nothing about Scottish history, save for the Anglo-Scottish wars, and nothing about Irish history, save for a single reference to William of Orange and the Battle of the Boyne. The latter started with the French revolution and Napoleon, covered the Italian Risorgimento, and discussed the formation of Germany in 1871. The syllabus ended in 1914. The only references to Africa, India and east Asia were in the context of the British empire. This reflected a cultural dissonance, in which Africa was populated by peoples who were uncultured and uncivilised, unlike us, but whose artefacts, such as the Benin bronzes, we plundered and whose monuments we dismissed as \u201cmust have been constructed by other invaders\u201d.

{"title": "F1 to hold six sprint races in 2022 but Friday qualifying could set pole", "article": "Formula One will hold six sprint race meetings next season, the sporting director, Ross Brawn, has confirmed. The concept is being tested this year with three sprint races and Brawn said that while the format has been heralded as a success, F1 is almost certain to revert to awarding pole position for the grand prix from qualifying times rather than being decided by the sprint race on a Saturday.\nF1 has held two sprint race weekends this season, at Silverstone and Monza, with a third scheduled for Brazil in two weeks. The format features qualifying for the sprint on a Friday with the results of that race deciding the grid for the GP, with three, two and one drivers\u2019 championship points awarded to the top three. While discussions with the teams and the FIA continue, Brawn is confident one of the biggest criticisms of the format will be addressed, that of setting the fastest lap in qualifying being rewarded with pole position. \u201cIt\u2019s been a consistent comment amongst fans and drivers that the person who does the fastest single lap with low fuel in qualifying is the pole position holder,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we hadn\u2019t really considered that when we set out this new format. I would like to see a reversion to that being pole position. There is broad opinion that Friday should be pole position for the sprint weekends, so I would hope we can get that through for next year. I am optimistic on that.\u201d The venues for the sprint meeting are still under discussion but they will not feature in the opening or final rounds of the 23-race season. With the sprint qualifying races this season pedestrian at best, dialogue continues as to how the format could be further tweaked for 2022, but Brawn emphasised that given F1 will be using new cars next year any changes would be \u201cconservative and evolutionary\u201d. He confirmed that awarding more points further down the grid, potentially one-third of race points for the top 10, was one proposal in order to offer more incentive for drivers to challenge in the sprint.\n\u201cIt goes far enough down for people in lower positions to want to fight for it, but is not a number that will over-influence the championship,\u201d he said. Brawn believes reverse grids for the sprint are off the table for 2022 while the sport discusses the exact form it should take. Having it as an entirely standalone race remains an option, as does having its grid set by Friday\u2019s qualifying. The details will be addressed in a meeting with the teams after Brazil but Brawn said the format could be adopted across the full season in future if it proves to be a success.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/formula-one-six-sprint-races-2022-season-format-changes", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:28:24Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Muniain emerges from wild night to show why Basque rivalry is like no other | Sid Lowe", "article": "When the final whistle went at the end of the Basque derby, Iker Muniain embraced the referee and then made his way through the noise and the rain straight to Alex Remiro. By the time he got there, I\u00f1aki Williams was already hugging the goalkeeper and soon more Athletic players came to comfort him. The clock had shown 90.47 when Remiro made the mistake that cost his team victory and there was little consolation, just a lost expression, but that didn\u2019t stop them trying. \u201cI tried to raise his spirits, give him affection, tell him it it\u2019s OK, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Muniain said, standing pitchside still catching his breath. Muniain and Alex Remiro are not teammates, not any more. Remiro is the Real Sociedad goalkeeper, Muniain the Athletic captain whose shot had just raced past him and into the net to make it 1-1 at the end of a wet, wild night. And if anyone knew it did matter, this Sunday especially, it was them. Which is why they were there together when it was over, Muniain laying a hand upon Remiro\u2019s shoulder and looking for the right words. A goalkeeper who admits bad moments always follow you home, Remiro\u2019s look meanwhile revealed this one will follow him further than that. The first league goal Real had conceded at home this season could hardly have come at a worse time.\nThe board was just going up on a Basque derby that was the way it\u2019s supposed to be at last, the first played before fans for 630 days, when it happened. Real Sociedad were 1-0 up, Alexander Isak having scored from the spot early in the second half, and Athletic were down to 10 men. Better still for the home supporters, it was I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez, the man who had walked out on them and crossed the divide, who had given away the penalty \u2013 the sixth he has conceded at Athletic, three of them against his former club \u2013 and who had been sent off. When the card was shown, Remiro had leapt into the air celebrating. Now the fans were doing the same. Backs turned to the pitch, arms locked together, they bounced. How they had missed this. \u201cThis is the game I look forward to winning more than any other and that\u2019s true of everyone who feels Real Sociedad,\u201d the coach Imanol Alguacil had said the day before as the rain poured at Zubieta, and this time especially. There have been three meetings over the last e18 months, sure, but it wasn\u2019t the same, not even when one was the most historic Copa del Rey final there has been. That much was shown by Athletic and Real insisting on postponing the final. Few, if any clubs would have held on so long to get their people in, aware that that\u2019s the whole point. Now here they were again, miles better late than never. Sunday started with the bertso derbi, the Basque street poetry sing-off won by Athletic or la Real depending on which paper you read, and ended with 21 players on the pitch of which 18 had been through the youth systems at one of these two clubs. Fans drank together and sat together. Tickets were sold out, the Reale Arena packing in 37,066 \u2013 its highest attendance ever. And they belted out the club\u2019s anthem, holding aloft a tifo in blue and white and the colours of the Ikurri\u00f1a, the Basque flag. Then they played, the noise never falling. It had been frantic, fast, and if there was not a huge amount of football, it had been quite fun too, the tension and ferocity making up for what it lacked in finesses. Athletic had more shots, 11 to eight, and more corners, eight to two. Remiro had made three sharp saves. And Aritz Elustondo had produced two superb interceptions to deny Williams, the first after just sixty-two seconds. But the threat hadn\u2019t been overwhelming at all \u2013 in fact it had only occasionally been apparent \u2013 and now it appeared to have passed. Martin Zubimendi was in control, the defence had been reinforced and Real Sociedad, the Copa del Rey winners, were on the verge of defeating their rivals again and climbing three points clear, confirmation perhaps of their candidacy for the title. Only once had they reached week 11 on more points and now they were about to add three more, racking up an eighth clean sheet in 12 league games.\nBad Moon Rising was belting round the ground, scarves twirling. Tell me how it feels, the opening line runs. But then Athletic got a free kick on the top left corner of the area, Julen Lobete fouling Muniain as he cut inside. Muniain placed the ball. \u201cIt was wet. I wanted to hit hard and on target, thinking that someone might deflect it,\u201d he said, \u201cRemiro tried to clear it but those kinds of balls are difficult.\u201d His shot bent towards the near post and the Real Sociedad goalkeeper dived forwards, fists out like Superman. Rather than punching clear, though, he misjudged the flight \u2013 his and the ball\u2019s \u2013 and it went off his knuckles and into the top of the net. It was the 91st minute and 1-1. In the top corner of the ground, 543 Athletic fans went wild. All around it, maybe a hundred more did the same, figures in red and white leaping from within the sea of blue and white. Muniain sprinted towards the bench, which was sprinting towards him, and leapt into the arms of Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral. His players had resisted again \u2013 they have only been beaten once this season \u2013 and Athletic\u2019s manager wore a massive smile. They had deserved this, he said afterwards. \u201cThe draw stings but I\u2019m proud,\u201d his opposite number Imanol Alguacil insisted. No one was more stung than Remiro. In midweek, Australian keeper Matty Ryan had produced an astonishing performance at Celta in only his second league appearance of the season. Remiro had immediately returned to the side but now this had happened and against them, a derby decided by two men who crossed sides. On Sunday evening, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez, an ex-Real Sociedad player had been sent off and given away the penalty that seemed to have gifted his former club the victory, fans laughing as he left. And Remiro, an ex-Athletic player, had gifted his former club the equaliser. Not that the cases are quite the same. Born in Navarre, raised at Lezama, Remiro never actually played a first team game with Athletic. One Friday afternoon after training in 2018, he was called into a room with the then Athletic president Josu Urrutia and the former sporting director Jos\u00e9 Mari Amorrutu and told that if he didn\u2019t sign a new contract he wouldn\u2019t play. Kepa was leaving, an opportunity opening up, but Remiro had been sent out on loan twice and wasn\u2019t convinced the chance was real. The pressure helped him make up his mind: rather than bowing to it, he decided to depart, even if it meant a season not playing. With Iago Herrer\u00edn getting injured, Unai Sim\u00f3n, the fourth-choice keeper who would soon become first for club and country, was hurriedly recalled from his loan at Elche where he had only been for 20 days and Athletic followed through on the threat: Remiro was left out.\nA year later, he joined Real Sociedad. When he won the Copa del Rey with them, defeating Athletic in the final, he posted a video that emulated Williams\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m so tired\u201d celebration from the Super Cup three months earlier. It didn\u2019t seem a particularly big deal, but it was soon turned into one. Remiro insisted that he just thought it a funny line, that he was not mocking Williams and apologised to Athletic\u2019s players when they faced each other in the league immediately after. \u201cSome said it was out of order, others that they didn\u2019t care, and others not to worry about it, but I felt ashamed,\u201d he later admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t like seeing the video out there but I learnt from it: not to be a dickhead next time there\u2019s a moment of euphoria.\u201d\nThe next time they met was anything but euphoric. Remiro looked devastated, eyes gone. Teammates came to him \u2013 Diego Rico literally lifted his chin up \u2013 but it was like he was lost. \u201cHe\u2019s gutted because of the way the goal happened. His error is the most visible but it was a series of errors,\u201d Zubimendi said. \u201cHe kept us alive until the end: he made great saves,\u201d Alguacil insisted, \u201cfootball is that: getting it right and getting it wrong. Today he got it right lots of times and got it wrong just once. He\u2019s a professional and no doubt that tomorrow he will be up for the next game again.\u201d Even former Real Sociedad goalkeeper Sander Westerveld, there the last time they started a season this well, leading the league early, not losing until February \u2013 against Athletic, inevitably \u2013 and chasing all the way to the line, offered support. None of which is especially unusual but they weren\u2019t the first to Remiro, the symbol of a rivalry that\u2019s still different to the rest. Instead, it was I\u00f1aki Williams and Iker Muniain, the Athletic captain who had stood and applauded la Real as they lifted the trophy at the end of the cup final they had waited for their whole lives, and whose shot flew past Remiro on the night when the fans finally returned to make the derby the kind of day it\u2019s supposed to be.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/01/athletic-bilbao-real-sociedad-iker-muniain-basque-derby", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:33:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "A stitch in time: simple, low-skill clothes mending and alteration techniques", "article": "My memory of my mother\u2019s sewing basket stretches as far back as I can recall. Even now, if I went looking for it I\u2019m sure the fabric scraps, loose buttons, thimbles, pink pin cushion and spools of coloured thread would be exactly as I remember them. It seemed like something every grown-up house would have: the relevant tools to sew on lost buttons or stitch together ballet costumes. But as an adult, I\u2019ve never owned a sewing kit. I outsource all my clothing repairs to my dry cleaner or tailor. Speaking to Nicole Mallalieu, a fashion lecturer at the Australian College of the Arts, about easy home repairs made me realise I\u2019ve been missing out on one of life\u2019s simple pleasures. The satisfaction and meditation of mending something for yourself.\nHow to sew on a button Before you sew on a button, Mallalieu says to \u201ctake the time to examine the other buttons on the garment\u201d so you can see what stitching pattern to use, and where to place it. She says to start by threading a needle with thread, doubling the thread over and knotting it at the bottom. Then, hold the button in place and starting from behind the fabric, poke the needle through the fabric and one hole of the button and pull it until the knot hits the back of the fabric. Then feed the needle back through the other hole, and push it through to the other side of the fabric. \u201cYou keep doing that until the button feels quite secure,\u201d she says. If the button has four holes you can stitch in straight lines, or make a cross \u2013 just follow the same pattern as the garment\u2019s other buttons. To finish, poke the needle through one hole to the back of the fabric and make a knot by wrapping the thread around the needle two or three times before pulling it through, and cutting the tail off. This is called a French knot. If you want more guidance, Mallalieu suggests looking at online tutorials like this one. How to darn a sock \u201cThe act of darning brings you into a meditative state,\u201d says Mallalieu, \u201cyou\u2019re fixing the sock instead of fixing life, but kind of fixing life as well.\u201d To darn a sock, she says you need a darning mushroom which is a piece of wood shaped like, well, a mushroom.\nYou place it inside the sock, so the hole is spread over the curve of the mushroom. She suggests getting yarn to match or compliment the colour of your sock. Starting from one corner, she says to \u201cstitch with the yarn and a needle to cover the hole in the sock with what looks like bars in a jail\u201d. Once you have captured all of the fabric with vertical lines, work the needle back through the stitches horizontally, \u201cone under, one over, one under, one over as if you\u2019re weaving fabric\u201d. She tells me there are lots of videos online that provide clear instructions for how to do this. How to sew a patch over a hole If you don\u2019t have a lot of skills, Mallaelieu thinks patching can be a very fun way to cover holes or stains or embellish clothes. She says to embrace the visible mending trend so \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re not very good at stitching\u201d. She suggests using a \u201ccolourful yarn or thread\u201d and doing a \u201crunning stitch by going in and out with a needle\u201d around the edge or across the fabric which \u201cyou might need to pin in place\u201d. Repairing fallen hems\nThe easiest way to repair a fallen hem is to use hemming tape, that you put inside the hem and press with an iron, but this is a stopgap that will only hold until the next wash. Alternatively, you can stitch by hand using a needle with a single thread, knotted at the end. Mallalieu says to press the hem first and then stitch between the two edges of the fabric, \u201cyour aim is to have it not show on the outside\u201d. She suggests watching an online tutorial that demonstrates different techniques like herringbone or whip stitches. If you\u2019re handy with a sewing machine and the hem was machine stitched, she says, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to get back onto a sewing machine, press the hem into shape and copy what\u2019s been sewn.\u201d According to Mallalieu adjusting the length of a hem is a two-person job, because you need \u201csomebody else to measure it up from the floor and pin it on you\u201d to be sure it\u2019s even. She advises pressing the hem and then putting the garment back on to be sure it\u2019s sitting where you want it, before cutting and sewing it into place. How to safely turn your jeans into shorts To cut your jeans into even shorts, Mallalieu says you need to lie them down flat and match the inseam from the crotch to the ankle, then fold them in half so the legs are one on top of the other.\nUsing a big pair of scissors, cut through both legs at the same time. Keep in mind that denim will fray a centimetre or two after it\u2019s been cut, so you need to leave a bit of extra length. How to change the length of a sleeve\nMallalieu says sleeve alterations really depend on the item\u2019s fabric and the finish you want. If you just want to cut the sleeve off and leave a raw edge, you need to be aware of the fabric\u2019s weave. \u201cThe tighter the weave, the less likely it is to fall apart, finer fabrics with looser weaves are more likely to fray.\u201d To prevent fraying she recommends \u201crunning a small zig zag stitch around the edge\u201d. Alternatively, she says you can cut the sleeves off a T-shirt, or anything that\u2019s cotton jersey without worrying because \u201cit won\u2019t fray, it\u2019ll just roll up\u201d. She says if \u201cyou\u2019re turning a shirt into a short sleeve shirt, cut it to the length you want plus three centimetres, so you can fold it over one centimetre, and then two centimetres,\u201d and hem it by running a sewing machine around the edge, or if you\u2019re doing it by hand, use a herringbone stitch. Mallalieu offers some final advice, applicable to any home-mending job: \u201cKnow that it\u2019s not that hard and give it a crack.

It certainly was for Shane Jenek, the Brisbane-born performer best known as his drag alias, Courtney Act. About 60 pages into Jenek\u2019s new memoir, Caught in the Act, he experiences his first kiss with someone of the same gender. It arrives with appropriate fanfare: \u201can entire lifetime of denied sexuality was unleashed in a single moment,\u201d he writes. \u201cSomething innate and intrinsic that had lain just below the surface for the past 18 years was being acknowledged for the first time.\u201d It was huge for Jenek \u2013 it just took him a couple of decades to realise that. \u201cAt the time, it was just exciting \u2013 and then when I was writing it, 21 years later, I was so overwhelmed with emotion, because I realised that I could never understand, at [the time of] that kiss, what it all meant, and what the 18 years leading up to that meant,\u201d he says.\nNow 39, Jenek has settled into a rare kind of mainstream ubiquity for a drag performer; in Australia, he\u2019s something of a household name, thanks to time on the first season of Australian Idol, an Australian Story episode about his life, and a stint hosting One Plus One. Despite his fame, writing Caught in the Act made Jenek realise there was a lot of his past he had never dealt with. \u201cTo reflect back on it \u2026 I just sat there sobbing, for that teenage boy who retrospectively struggled so much. I didn\u2019t even know it was a struggle at the time, because it was just life happening.\u201d Caught in the Act is filled with poignant moments like these, pieces of a complex puzzle that Jenek \u2013 who uses he/him pronouns out of drag, as he was during our interview, and she/her pronouns in drag \u2013 has only been able to properly assemble recently.\nBeginning with Jenek\u2019s upbringing in Brisbane, the book sketches his most significant milestones: his first time in drag; competing on Idol; time spent working in clubs along Oxford Street, Sydney\u2019s \u201cgay Golden Mile\u201d; an eventual move to the US, and an appearance on the sixth season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. In its final pages, he details his winning stint on the UK\u2019s Celebrity Big Brother.\nDespite Jenek being a first-time memoirist, Caught in the Act is eminently readable, balancing emotional and political epiphanies with saucy, sordid party scenes and an appealing, rough-and-tumble sense of style. At its best, Caught in the Act serves as a kind of personal history of Oxford Street at the turn of the millennium, with Jenek recalling, in minute detail, the many codes and subcultures of the Sydney queer scene: the correct and incorrect ways to dress and wear makeup; the petty beefs that were fostered and abandoned; the many club nights that opened and closed but have rarely been historicised in the mainstream. The ability to look back at this period, the beginnings of Jenek\u2019s drag career, brought on more realisations.\nThese were related to his \u201cprism of understanding at the time\u201d, and how it filtered his memories. \u201cI can see that that exact same situation might have been a hellhole for someone else, and so that was really interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cI can totally see how that experience was very narrow and limited to white, gay men. And even my deviations from that \u2013 being feminine, or maybe having attractions that were not strictly homosexual \u2013 were sort of just ironed out.\u201d But on stage, it was a different story. \u201cOne thing that I did love about the drag scene was that it was \u2013 well, it wasn\u2019t diverse in that there were no cis women,\u201d he corrects himself, \u201cbut as far as ages and races and genders, other than cis women, it was really diverse.\u201d While the punters were mostly white and male, backstage Jenek \u201cjust loved sitting in a dressing room with a 60-year-old queen and an 18-year-old queen\u201d listening to \u201cso much oral history \u2013 stories about Sydney in the 80s, during the Aids crisis, hearing stories about Sydney drag icons. I remember feeling so moved by that as a young person.\u201d\nJenek realised \u201cthat there was no access to that if it wasn\u2019t for the oral history that was happening in dressing rooms and sewing bees\u201d. Chronicling those stories felt like an act of respect to the people who shaped the scene, \u201ca very small thank you to those people and that time\u201d. In the book, Jenek alludes to the fact that gay bars like those he frequented in the 2000s \u2013 as a performer and patron \u2013 are dwindling in number. (There were about 1,400 gay bars worldwide in 2019, as compared with more than 2,500 in the US alone in 1976.) Jenek suggests it\u2019s a loss for queer subcultures but, perhaps, a marker of gradual societal acceptance of LGBT+ people. Oxford Street was a draw for Jenek \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t feel that I could be queer in the world that I existed in \u2013 you certainly couldn\u2019t wander down the street holding someone\u2019s hand\u201d. Now, \u201cobviously the culture has changed\u201d. Jenek points to the rise of dating apps, which have siphoned off bar patronage, making businesses less viable. This is \u201cboth a blessing and a curse\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that people don\u2019t feel the need for these exclusive queer spaces as much, but there is a real magic in them.\u201d Caught in the Act often grapples with this tension \u2013 between the mainstreaming and protection of queer culture, the popularity of TV shows like Drag Race and the economic impacts, both good and bad, they have on local scenes. Ultimately, Jenek sees the urgent need for more diversity \u2013 for easy access to different stories. He acknowledges that his childhood and adolescent years may not have been so suffused with shame had he been able to see queerness reflected in mainstream spaces.\n\u201cWhen people get to hear [a] diversity of stories \u2013 whether that\u2019s gender, sexuality, race, age, disability \u2013 all of those different stories that for so long haven\u2019t been told, when those stories get told in the mainstream, they change the world for the better,\u201d he says. Particularly for young people, mainstream culture is \u201cinescapable\u201d. \u201cAs queer people, we might find a point where we deviate away from the mainstream, but ultimately we\u2019re, for the most part, born and exist inside the mainstream until \u2026 we\u2019re able to break out of it. \u201cTo be able to change what the mainstream [is] to something \u2026 more inclusive to more people means that less people will have to find a way out of it. More people will be able to find value in themselves and in the world that they just already exist in \u2013 I think that\u2019s a wonderful future.\u201d To Jenek, this isn\u2019t about assimilation but acceptance. \u201cI don\u2019t think the goal is for everyone to be straight, and the goal is not for everyone to be mainstream \u2013 the goal is for everyone to be themselves.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/02/courtney-acts-coming-of-age-to-reflect-back-on-it-i-just-sat-there-sobbing", "last_update": "2021-11-01T04:32:33Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Unpacking: the meditative puzzle game that\u2019s all about organising", "article": "Most people know well the tedium and joy of moving into some small space and making it their own. Meticulously putting things away might not immediately seem like award-winning video game material \u2013 but Tim Dawson is hoping it will prove popular. \u201cThe whole thing is already sort of game-like,\u201d says Dawson, one of the co-founders of Witch Beam, the Australian developers behind new indie game Unpacking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the delight and surprise of pulling stuff out of boxes and not knowing what will come next \u2026 and you\u2019ve got this clear end goal where everything is finally organised.\u201d Now available for PC, Switch and Xbox One, Unpacking won game of the year at this year\u2019s Australian Game Developers\u2019 Awards \u2013 the same title won in 2019 by the riotously successful Untitled Goose Game. In line with recent trends towards \u201cwholesome\u201d gaming, Unpacking is a self-described zen puzzler \u2013 a kind of Marie Kondo-esque balm for the chaotic world we live in.\nThe game\u2019s narrative is laid-back: a quiet and charming tale of a life over time, told mostly through the items brought between moves as the unseen main character grows up. Soft toys, books, a battered and chipped mug; familiar items reappear out of cardboard boxes as the years progress and the locations change from a childhood room, to a small uni flat, to a crowded suburban sharehouse and beyond. Dawson and his fellow Witch Beam co-founders, Sanatana \u201cNat\u201d Mishra and composer Jeff van Dyck, split from established studios to go indie, with their first project the hyperkinetic (and critically well-received) arcade shooter Android Assault Cactus in 2015. While looking for a new project to work on, Dawson moved in with his partner, Wren Brier \u2013 an artist who had previously worked on games like Jetpack Joyride and Fruit Ninja \u2013 and an idea clicked.\n\u201cI helped him with packing up his stuff, and we realised: every item is like a little adventure,\u201d says Brier, who is the creative lead on the game. \u201cThis one came from Tokyo Disney; this one\u2019s from when you went skiing \u2026 and unpacking it all, it\u2019s both discovery and self-expression at the same time.\u201d \u201cYou can tell a lot about a person from the items they own,\u201d adds Dawson. \u201cThat was really exciting to me from a narrative storytelling point of view, to tell a story without cutscenes or lectures.\u201d\nThe game is, at heart, pretty simple: you click on items and place them wherever you want in a room, until you\u2019re completely unpacked. But since it\u2019s a puzzle game, there\u2019s limits to where you can acceptably leave things \u2013 with wrong choices marked with an angry, pulsating outline. Kitchen knives, for instance, can\u2019t simply be packed away on the floor, or books left strewn across a bed. \u201cYou should be able to put things where you want, within reason,\u201d says Dawson, \u201cbut every now and then, we\u2019re a bit more specific about something,\u201d \u2013 like a secret diary, or a meaningful photograph \u2013 \u201cand those points usually serve as the sort of emotional beats of the game.\u201d\nSet to the extremely chilled-out backdrop of guitars and synths, a very personal form of order gradually emerges from the chaotic piles of boxes and knick-knacks. Much of the game\u2019s charm lies in its capacity for self-expression, something the team discovered in prototyping. \u201cI remember one friend, she took out this juicer, and she was like \u2018I never use these\u2019, and she shoved it as far back as she could behind a bunch of other items,\u201d laughs Brier. \u201cIt turns out that people love to watch other people play Unpacking because it\u2019s something that everyone knows how to do. \u201cSo it\u2019s really easy to backseat drive, and you learn a lot about someone when you watch them unpack.\u201d It also led to the discovery of some unexpected cultural differences. \u201cQuite a few Asian-American players asked us if they could store stuff in the oven,\u201d says Brier. \u201cAnd I think it was a Latvian player, she didn\u2019t know what the dish rack was. They have a kind of built-in dish rack cupboard above the sink, so they don\u2019t need a separate rack.\u201d\nBuilding the game, they were conscious of representation across cultures (\u201cWe had a strong reaction to the dreidel,\u201d Brier says), genders (\u201cthe tampons and stuff \u2026 dudes are kind of bewildered, but women are like, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen that in a game before!\u2019\u201d), and even geography. The game is set in Brisbane \u2013 which most people won\u2019t pick up on. \u201cThe first level, the kid\u2019s room, it\u2019s set in a Queenslander,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cSome people will recognise the boards on the walls, they might recognise the gum trees outside \u2026 There\u2019s something cool about a well-realised world.\u201d Witch Beam joins a wave of small Australian teams punching above their weight on the international stage, alongside breakout studios like Team Cherry (Hollow Knight) and House House (Untitled Goose Game), as well as more modest entrants including Beethovan and Dinosaur (The Artful Escape) and Modern Storytellers (The Forgotten City). And with Unpacking they\u2019re hoping for an international market, for a game that deals with a universally meditative experience. \u201cI thought we were making a niche game that would just appeal to people who liked organising stuff,\u201d Dawson says, \u201cbut it actually seems to have a broader appeal.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/nov/02/unpacking-the-meditative-puzzle-game-thats-all-about-organising", "last_update": "2021-11-02T02:26:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Gladys Berejiklian says pork barrelling would not \u2018be a surprise to anybody\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s not democracy either", "article": "In all the revelations to tumble out of the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption in the last two days of hearings, one barely raised an eyebrow. With unnerving nonchalance, Gladys Berejiklian spoke plainly of directing tens of millions of dollars to Wagga Wagga for political gain. Of course she had supported grants going to the Riverina Conservatorium of Music and the Australian Clay Target Association, the former NSW premier explained, even against departmental advice. There were seats to be won. Voters to claw back. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a surprise to anybody that we throw money at seats to keep them,\u201d she said. The evidence barely raised a ripple.\nIndeed, it appeared to be used by Berejiklian as a kind of protective shield from the commission\u2019s attempts to establish whether she gave Daryl Maguire, her then secret boyfriend, favourable treatment on projects he had been pushing for in his electorate. The money was not doled out to favour Maguire, Berejiklian told the commission. Not at all. It favoured a region where the Liberal party\u2019s fortunes had suffered dramatically as a byelection loomed. \u201cAt the end of the day, whether we like it or not, that\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. Have we grown so conditioned to such brazen political conduct \u2013 albeit entirely legal \u2013 that it is now accepted as a form of defence? And what does our collective shrug of the shoulders tell politicians, current and future, about the risk-to-benefit ratio of shovelling public funds to marginal seats? Her former deputy premier, John Barilaro, has the answer. Earlier this year, he told a parliamentary inquiry into the administration of bushfire recovery grants pork barrelling was equivalent to \u201cinvestment\u201d. \u201cWhen you think about it, every single election that every party goes to, we make commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to call that pork barrelling, you want to call that buying votes, it\u2019s what the elections are for.\u201d Berejiklian said the process was \u201cunfortunately not unique or uncommon\u201d after it was revealed last year that $140m in grants given to councils prior to the previous NSW election had gone overwhelmingly to Coalition-held seats. But her Icac evidence reveals, in stark terms, where politicians draw the new line in the sand. Integrity experts warn this new apparent norm of pork barrelling, condoned by the ex-premier, should not be allowed to settle. Using public funds to benefit whichever party happens to be in power is not part and parcel of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. It is an abuse of government. It entrenches power to the incumbent. It tips the electoral scales against parties of opposition. It may not be a criminal offence, but it must be rooted out for liberal democracy to thrive. Geoffrey Watson, SC, a former counsel assisting to Icac, said as much last week, after Berejiklian\u2019s first day of evidence. \u201cLet\u2019s drop this expression pork barrelling, let\u2019s call it what it really is: misuse of public money,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong. I just don\u2019t understand why we excuse this conduct. The whole idea of \u2018pork-barrelling, it\u2019s OK because everyone does it\u2019, that would soon lead to the most appalling conduct. You just slide to the lowest denominator.\u201d In NSW, at least, there are bodies like the Independent Commission Against Corruption to shine a light on such practices. That is sadly lacking at a federal level. Not so Berejiklian\u2019s worldview of pork barrelling as the norm. That is very much shared by her commonwealth counterparts.\nSports rorts brought that into sharp relief, more than any other scandal in recent memory. The government was condemned for directing the vast majority of the $100m Community Sports Infrastructure grants program into marginal or targeted electorates, usually against the advice of Sport Australia. But there have been plenty more examples since. Earlier this year, it was revealed the commonwealth had awarded $389m for commuter car parks one day before Scott Morrison called the 2019 federal election. Before that, we heard that a grant scheme for security cameras, known as the Safer Communities Fund, was used to distribute $8.5m to 53 projects before the last election, only five of which were in safe Labor seats. In too many instances, the money is doled out in ways that contradicts departmental advice. But when Berejiklian was faced with this proposition, she dismissed bureaucrats as lacking the requisite political nous for such decision-making. Departments, she said, were not expert at \u201cwinning byelections\u201d. Indeed they are not. That\u2019s why their advice is so important.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/gladys-berejiklian-says-pork-barrelling-would-not-be-a-surprise-to-anybody-but-its-not-democracy-either", "last_update": "2021-11-01T09:55:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Melbourne Cup 2021: is a new welfare campaign just good PR or will it protect horses?", "article": "Organisers of the Melbourne Cup have been working to clean up its image after the high profile deaths of seven horses in the past six years. The changes \u2013 aimed at making sure horses are fit to race and do not have undetected underlying conditions \u2013 have been rolled out alongside an advertising and social media campaign that focuses on horse welfare. But will it be enough? What is being done to prevent horse deaths in the race? In 2020, after pre-race favourite Anthony van Dyck broke down during the cup and was later euthanised, Racing Victoria commissioned a review into the injuries and deaths of international horses during the Melbourne spring racing carnival during the past decade.\nThe review made 44 recommendations, 41 of which were adopted. The most significant \u2013 and from a racing industry perspective controversial \u2013 was the requirement that all Cup runners, local and international, undergo a diagnostic CT scan of all four limbs prior to being allowed to race. Racing Victoria will cover the cost of the scans. The number of international horses permitted to enter Victoria for the spring carnival has been capped at 24 and all international arrivals must be scanned prior to travel, at the cost of owners and trainers, as well as on arrival at the Werribee quarantine facility. Scans and veterinary checks must be conducted or have oversight by Racing Victoria veterinarians. Limits were also placed on the number of races horses could run once in Australia. The reason for this rule change is that a post mortem exam of Anthony van Dyck, who suffered catastrophic fractures to his left front fetlock, showed the five-year-old Irish stallion had signs of pre-existing stress fractures or other pre-existing conditions. A scan may have picked up the weakness and prompted the racetrack vets to order his scratching. Will this make a difference? It certainly would have made a difference for Anthony van Dyck. Scanning or X-raying before international competition has become standard in other parts of the equestrian world and most top horses have a full set of scans done annually as a precaution. The main reason not to scan, other than cost, is worry that you would discover something that would prevent the horse from competing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut it\u2019s not a failsafe: horses can have catastrophic injuries without any pre-existing conditions. Concern remains that the harder ground at Flemington may increase the risk for international horses that are used to running in softer conditions. One of the three recommendations that Racing Victoria did not accept following Anthony van Dyck\u2019s death was that the minimum targeted track rating for the Melbourne Cup be changed to \u201cGood 4\u201d from \u201cGood 3\u201d, on a scale where one is a dry hard track and 10 is very wet. Racing Victoria said it did not accept that recommendation in part because it said that track guidelines must be applied consistently to all races for the integrity of the sport. Will the whip be banned? In short, not yet. Last year, Racing Victoria took a proposal to phase out the use of whips, except when necessary for safety, to the national body, Racing Australia. It caused tensions at Racing Australia to boil over to the point that the organisation appointed an independent chairperson for the first time in its history, but there\u2019s no public resolution on the issue so far.\nRacing Australia was previously chaired by Peter V\u2019Landys, the chair of Racing NSW, which does not support Victoria\u2019s push to reform whip use and has branded it a distracting PR exercise. There are limited studies showing the effect of whip use on horses and racing is not the only discipline to use a whip \u2013 it\u2019s just the most high profile. But an Australian study which examined the steward reports from whip-free apprentice races in the UK found no appreciable difference in run times or safety issues. Is all of this just a PR exercise? It\u2019s not just a PR exercise, but the positive publicity is a significant factor. Having horses die during the biggest race in the country is very negative publicity; taking steps that could reduce those deaths will both reduce that negative publicity and improve horse welfare outcomes.\nMost of the advertising put out by the racing industry in Victoria ahead of this year\u2019s Cup has been focused on horse welfare, showcasing retraining facilities and registered charities which focus on rehoming ex-racehorses. The industry has also spent several years working on making thoroughbreds a marketable riding horse in the very fashion-driven world of competitive equestrian sports. There are off the track specific dressage and showjumping events and the Racing Victoria Off The Track program sponsors the Garryowen, the most prestigious horse show class in the country. These programs lack the scale to retrain and find suitable homes for the more than 8,000 horses that exit the racing industry every year. There is also still a lack of data around what happens to racehorses after they retire. Racing Australia requires trainers or owners to record where they send their horses and publishes high-level data on those statistics annually but it only tracks the first move after racing, usually made before the horse turns 10. The average lifespan of a thoroughbred is 30 years. There is increasing agreement from both the thoroughbred industry and animal welfare groups that a meaningful aftercare strategy needs to consider the horse\u2019s entire lifespan. A senate inquiry into this issue in 2018 recommended the establishment of a national horse database that would include all horses, not just racehorses, but progress has stalled. A separate working group of the racing industry and welfare experts established after an ABC story showing racehorses slaughtered at export abattoirs is expected to release a substantive report on thoroughbred aftercare shortly.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/02/melbourne-cup-is-a-new-welfare-campaign-just-good-pr-or-will-it-protect-horses", "last_update": "2021-11-01T08:13:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Rural Australians are facing life-threatening wait times for medical specialists", "article": "When Dr Rebecca McGowan referred a severely asthmatic patient from Albury Wodonga to a local respiratory specialist, she considered the patient lucky to get an appointment in February. \u201cNo, February 2023,\u201d the patient told her in tears. The respiratory clinic told McGowan it was at a point it could not take any more patients. So she pulled strings with a Melbourne specialist she knew at medical school. Her patient\u2019s asthma is so bad that she cannot drive herself, so her sister will drive her to the capital, three and a half hours away. \u201cIt\u2019s something rural people put up with, but it\u2019s appalling,\u201d McGowan says. The 17-month wait to see a respiratory specialist is the worst, but McGowan says the waiting times for endocrinologists, neurologists, pain specialists and ADHD/ASD psychology assessments are all over six months, and psychiatrists and rheumatologists are taking no new patients at all. Albury Wodonga is a large rural town of more than 100,000 people. Its oncologists service 500,000 people as they cover a lot of rural Victoria and New South Wales, who prefer to travel to Albury rather than Melbourne for specialist services such as radiation. The situation has been exacerbated recently because so many appointments and elective surgeries have been delayed due to Covid-19. Dangerous health inequity Dr Marco Giuseppin, the chair of the Council of Rural Doctors at the Australian Medical Association, says \u201cmany areas of rural Australia face long wait times to see non-GP specialists \u2026 the AMA has long been concerned about this and its effect on health inequity in rural and remote Australia\u201d.\n\u201cThe consequences of delay to care can mean that conditions progress, making them more difficult to treat and increasing potential suffering in our vulnerable remote communities,\u201d Giuseppin says. McGowan says further consequences include increased anxiety for the patient as well the GP, frustration and anger, increased instances of chronic disease and hospitalisation, as well as increased instances of death. \u201cRural people have much higher death rates because we don\u2019t have the same access to quality medical treatment,\u201d she says. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nIn a submission to the inquiry into health in rural, regional and remote NSW, the Cancer Council said residents there had poorer cancer survival outcomes compared with their city counterparts, citing distance from, and availability of specialists and diagnostic services as a significant factor. \u201cNationally, five-year all-cancer survival decreases with increasing remoteness, from 62% for major cities to 55% for very remote areas,\u201d the submission said. Because of the longer wait times locally, McGowan will routinely advise her patients to go to Melbourne or Sydney for a specialist opinion. They must add the cost of taking time off work and accommodation expenses to the specialist\u2019s fees. But even this is often not possible for anyone who cannot drive, including many elderly and disabled patients, as public transport is \u201cabysmal\u201d, McGowan says. The federal regional health minister, David Gillespie, a gastroenterologist, says the medical profession needs to shift its mindset to solve the problem. \u201cThe problem we face is that too many of our GPs and non-GP specialists are bedded down in the bright lights of our capital cities, aided by the metro-centric focused training of specialists required by the colleges, and the metro-centric employment and placement of interns, residents and registrars in metropolitan public hospitals rather than regional and rural hospitals,\u201d Gillespie says. \u201cThis is not an overnight problem \u2013 it takes at least 12 years of study and training to become a doctor, sometimes longer to be a sub-specialist. And it is not a problem that the federal government can resolve without the involvement and mindset shift of the medical profession itself.\u201d The federal government is supporting the training of non-GP specialists in regional and rural areas through the specialist training program, with rural targets for each of the 13 participating medical specialist colleges. The program has increased the proportion of training delivered in regional, rural and remote areas from 309 training posts in 2018 to 413 in 2021. The program\u2019s integrated rural training pipeline has provided a further 93 funded rural posts in 2021. \u2018Dudded for access\u2019 Peter Wakeford is a retired physician who specialised in gastroenterology and during his career serviced the north-west of NSW from Tamworth hospital, with one other physician. Wakeford describes times he would have a \u201chell of a day at work, go home for dinner and a guy from Walcha would ring at eight o\u2019clock\u201d which would require an hour\u2019s drive followed by an hour\u2019s consultation. \u201cMy [professional] partner and I made a promise, we would not be the doctor who couldn\u2019t come,\u201d Wakeford said.\nWakeford describes keeping the radio playing loudly on drives to keep himself awake but many times having to sleep by the side of the road. He was only ever paid for the time spent with the patient, as there was no recompense for travel.

{"title": "Borrowers rush to lock in low interest rates amid expectations of RBA rise", "article": "Borrowers are rushing to lock in low interest rates amid gathering expectations Australia\u2019s central bank will declare an end to its record low cash rate earlier than its current prediction of 2024. Economists say the Reserve Bank of Australia has little choice but to revise its rate rise timing given mounting evidence the economy is recovering quickly from the lengthy Covid-triggered lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. It\u2019s one year since the RBA lowered its official rate to just 0.1% and today\u2019s board meeting is under pressure to state when it expects to raise it. No increase is imminent \u2013 and it\u2019s now 11 years since the last rate rise \u2013 but markets are anticipating the bank will bring forward the timing of that move.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t go with a date, then my fear would be that the market will interpret that as a signal they could move as soon as early next year,\u201d David Plank, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics, said. At stake is the fate of interest rates for those with mortgages but also those seeking to enter a market where house prices continue to rise at an annual rate of more than 20%, new figures out today show. The RBA hasn\u2019t raised rates since November 2010. Bank economists are tipping the increase will come towards the end of 2022 or into 2023, although the market is anticipating as many as four rises \u2013 or a full percentage point increase \u2013 in 2022. Analysts such as NAB\u2019s chief economist Alan Oster dismiss the likelihood of rate rises next year as \u201cgarbage\u201d, but they can point to a range of indicators of a reviving economy and the prospect of rising wages and prices to follow. The core consumer price index for the September quarter released last week came in at 2.1%, creeping into the RBA\u2019s preferred 2-3% inflation band for the first time since early 2016. Job ads in ANZ\u2019s survey, out Monday, rose 6.2% in October, returning to a level reached in June prior to the lockdowns caused by Delta Covid outbreaks. In NSW alone, new job ads last month leapt 17%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nPlank said the speed of recovery in the jobs market suggests a rethink about unemployment. Since so many people had stopped looking for work, the true jobless rate was assumed to be much higher than the official rate of 4.6%. \u201cOne of the reasons participation [in the job market] dropped was that a lot of people that got laid off got told by their employer \u2018you\u2019ve got a job back with us as soon as we reopen\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t bother searching because they knew they had a job.\u201d The ultra-low interest rates have fuelled rocketing house prices although there is evidence the propellant is losing some of its force. One is that modestly tighter lending controls kicked in from today but also because borrowing costs are starting to tick higher. Still, Australia\u2019s house prices rose another 1.5% in October according to researchers CoreLogic in data out today. The advance was in line with the September rise, and left prices 21.6% higher than for a year earlier. Among the capitals, Sydney\u2019s house prices added 1.5% for the month, while Melbourne\u2019s gain was just under 1%. Brisbane led the advance with a 2.5% rise in October but Perth notched its first negative monthly result since June, dropping 0.1%. \u201cHousing prices continue to outpace wages by a ratio of about 12:1,\u201d CoreLogic\u2019s research director Tim Lawless said. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why first-homebuyers are becoming a progressively smaller component of housing demand.\u201d Rents, meanwhile, were up 0.7% for the month, up from a pace of 0.6% in September, according to the figures, which are not seasonally adjusted. New borrowing commitments for housing totalled $30.3b in September, according to Bureau of Statistics data out on Monday that were adjusted to take into account seasonal changes. That figure, though down 1.4% from the previous month, remains 35.5% higher than a year earlier. Historically, about 85% of mortgages have been at variable rates and the rest at fixed ones. During the plunge in borrowing costs after Covid\u2019s first wave, that ratio has shifted to about 50-50 as borrowers flock to secure the lower interest rates, Plank said.\nAs loans typically take three months or so to come through, borrowers are already seeing market rates starting to rise. That is one factor curbing future house price rises, NAB\u2019s Oster said. \u201cYou are probably going to mainly see [a slowing in the growth rate] by about early next year, and you might see house prices flattish from the middle of the year,\u201d he said. So that means only a 5% increase or so in 2022 compared with about 25% this year. The rapid changes in the market are adding to the challenges faced by the RBA to steady the economic ship. GDP dropped at annual rate of about 3.5% in the September quarter and will probably rise about 3% in the final three months of 2021, Oster said. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to have this sort of massive fall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you get a big bounce because people are now believing that lockdowns are gone, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/02/borrowers-rush-to-lock-in-low-interest-rates-amid-expectations-of-rba-rise", "last_update": "2021-11-01T08:04:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "More cancer patients rejected for disability support pension after rule change, report finds", "article": "Cancer patients and those with acquired brain injuries were among the worst affected by Coalition reforms to the disability support pension that saw an overall increase in denied claims and a blowout in processing times, a new report shows. The report by management consultants Health Outcomes International, commissioned by the federal government in response to an audit office report, examined the revised pension assessment process brought in under Tony Abbott\u2019s prime ministership in 2015. The changes included using \u201cgovernment-contracted doctors\u201d to assess applicants and requiring them to provide existing medical evidence rather than a report from their own doctor. These followed sweeping changes to the eligibility criteria introduced by the Gillard government in 2011.\nHealth Outcomes International found all disabilities had \u201chigher rejection rates post implementation of the 1 July 2015 changes\u201d. For example, among people with cancer, rejection rates increased to 60%, up from 47% before the reforms, while for those with musculoskeletal or immune system conditions, the proportion of denied claims soared above 80%. The 13 percentage point increase in denied claims for cancer patients was the highest of any condition, along with \u201cvisceral disorders\u201d, which refers to pain in organs of the chest, belly, or pelvis, and \u201cinherited disorders\u201d, which refers to genetic conditions. Cancer claims make up about 3% of the approximately 100,000 applications each year. People with acquired brain impairment, chronic pain, infectious diseases, skin disorder and burns saw an 11 percentage point increase in rejected claims. The report did not analyse separate eligibility changes introduced by the Gillard government, including new \u201cimpairment tables\u201d, which experts say made it much harder for applicants to get the pension.\nThe Gillard and Abbott-era reforms aimed to reduce spending on the disability support pension, but in doing so have led to a record number of people who are sick or have disabilities on the jobseeker payment. The new report comes with renewed focus on the payment, amid an ongoing Senate inquiry. The disability discrimination commissioner, Ben Gauntlett, told the inquiry on Monday the eligibility criteria and application process were \u201conerous\u201d and the government should consider whether they were \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Last week, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, was forced to defend the system after Guardian Australia reported the story of 29-year-old brain cancer patient George Upjohn, who is struggling to make ends meet on the much lower jobseeker payment. Campaigners say cancer patients generally struggle to get on to the payment until their condition is terminal and that changes are needed to rules that require a condition to be \u201cfully diagnosed, treated and stabilised\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nFormer hospital worker Julie Stephen, 56, was rejected for the disability support pension while battling breast cancer last year. After doctors found a lump in her breast, Stephen underwent chemotherapy, including a four-week course of the so-called \u201cred devil\u201d, a lumpectomy and radiation. She finished radiation in April and was cleared of breast cancer in June, though she said she still had not recovered from \u201cwhat they call that chemo brain\u201d. Stephen said she was fortunate her time on jobseeker payment coincided with a massive boost to the dole through the coronavirus supplement, which was withdrawn in March. She called for more support, saying people with cancer need to focus on their recovery. \u201cThe system needs a backup to help cancer patients that does not require them to jump through hoops to be considered.\u201d\nThe HOI report found that people were now mostly like to have their claim fail because their condition was not \u201cfully diagnosed, treated and stabilised\u201d, with this making up 53% of all denied applications. Previously people had been more likely to be rejected because their condition did not garner 20 points on the impairment tables, meaning it was not considered severe enough. The report found the Abbott government\u2019s changes were \u201cappropriate relating to the policy intent, and effective in improving the integrity\u201d of the disability support pension and were \u201ccost-effective\u201d, but noted they also \u201cincreased the time of decision making\u201d. A person could have been expected to wait 54 days on average in 2014, a figure that rose to 84 days by 2019. For some conditions the average wait was even longer, with cancer patients waiting an average of 96 days by 2019, people with chronic pain waiting 109 days, and people with intellectual disabilities waiting 113 days. The report made a number of minor recommendations, including the introduction of a new reporting template for a person\u2019s treating doctor to submit as part of their application. Economic Justice Australia was among the groups that welcomed that recommendation on Monday. Ruston has insisted that the system is working, but Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, said the 2015 changes were \u201cproblematic\u201d, particularly \u201cforcing people to be assessed by doctors who don\u2019t know them, instead of their own treating doctor who knows them best\u201d. A department of social services spokesperson said the 2015 changes were \u201caimed at improving the integrity of the assessment process in applying the existing eligibility criteria\u201d. \u201cThe evaluation found that the changes were appropriate and effective,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u2022 Do you have a story?

{"title": "\u2018A massive asset\u2019: 7ft 5in Liu Chuanxing tipped to hit heights in Australian basketball", "article": "Finding a super-sized bed to sleep in or a car with a suitably generous amount of legroom are not generally details a sporting club must consider when negotiating the acquisition of a new player. But then again, Liu Chuanxing is not your average athlete. Standing at 7ft 5in (226cm), the China international will become the tallest player in National Basketball League history when he makes his first appearance for the Brisbane Bullets this coming season. The 22-year-old, already given the moniker \u201cBig Liu\u201d by his new club, arrived in Australia last week. Having emerged from a two-week stint in hotel quarantine, where he had the time to get to know his new teammates by searching their profiles online, Liu took part in his first training session with the Bullets on Monday.\nInterest has been suitably piqued by his presence, not only due to the clear novelty factor of his stature (he was asked what size shoe he takes \u2013 18, for the record) but also for the impact a player of his size could potentially have on the game in Australia. Already capped by China, the young centre\u2019s imposing figure is an entirely unknown entity in the NBL and how opposition defences deal with his size remains to be seen. \u201cHe\u2019s a big fella,\u201d said Bullets point guard Jason Cadee, who has been assigned to look after his new teammate and make him feel welcome. \u201cHe moves pretty well for someone so big.\u201d Liu, who does not yet speak English, will also be shadowed by a translator during his time in Australia, although once he steps onto the court communication will pose a different hurdle to overcome. Cadee said it would take time, but the use of hand signals, certain words and names would be employed at the outset. \u201cThe language barrier is probably going to be one of the most difficult things, just trying to translate and talk to him on the floor,\u201d Cadee said. \u201cBut if we can keep it simple enough I think he\u2019ll be able to help us. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make people look very small, he\u2019s so big. He\u2019s a presence. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be a guy who we see play 20 or 25 minutes, but if we can get him to play 10 or 12 minutes and be effective and get him in positions to be successful he\u2019ll be a presence on the floor.\u201d The Bullets, and Cadee in particular, have been helpful in welcoming Liu as he embarks on his Australian adventure. \u201cThe club has helped me with the whole trip, from quarantine,\u201d Liu said. \u201cJason is a very good guy. He has tried to make me fit into this team as soon as possible.\u201d Liu has had a space allocated to him next to Cadee in the locker room and Bullets assistant general manager Sam Mackinnon indicated there may even be some efforts made from the English-speaking squad to learn Mandarin in an attempt to make assimilation easier. Speaking through his interpreter on Monday, Liu said he would do his best to break down the language barrier, but he was not expecting it to be easy at first. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit hard to remember their names first time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my first time in Australia, so it\u2019s a new environment. It takes some time to get used to it. But I will learn a little bit of English and remember all of their names. Right now, I remember most of them.\u201d At Brisbane airport after Liu touched down on Australian soil last week, Mackinnon pointed to the commercial benefits of having Liu on board and said the player\u2019s ability to attract a crowd was there \u201cfor all to see today\u201d. \u201cMost importantly for the club, we think he can play basketball and that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to be a massive asset for us,\u201d Mackinnon said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him here. He\u2019s a big fella and has a unique skills set to go with that. So he has the whole package and we\u2019re glad he\u2019s with us.\u201d The move is the result of months of planning as Liu\u2019s acquisition was organised over a series of online calls, with the difficulties posed by Covid and the player\u2019s particular requirements presenting unique challenges. \u201cWe met him a few months ago,\u201d Mackinnon said. \u201cZoom calls, talking about the opportunity with the Bullets, what he would need \u2013 like a translator. Liu was happy to come by himself but there are little things like, what kind of car does he get around in? What kind of bed does he sleep in? He\u2019s a big guy. \u201cNow we have him here he gets to do what he\u2019s great at \u2013 and that\u2019s play basketball.\u201d Liu will be joined in the NBL by his compatriot Zhou Qi, after the former NBA player was also unveiled on Monday by South East Melbourne Phoenix. Zhou, who stands at 7ft 1in (216cm), played 12 games off the bench for the Houston Rockets between 2017 and 2019 and still harbours hopes of returning to play at the highest level in the US at some stage. The retired Sam Harris, who played for the Perth Wildcats, Singapore Slingers, and Adelaide 36ers, was previously the tallest player in NBL history, standing at 7ft 3in (221cm), while Melbourne United\u2019s David Andersen (6ft 11in or 211cm) was tallest on Australian courts last season. The tallest player to ever grace an NBA court was Romanian Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, who was 7ft 7in (231cm).", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/02/a-massive-asset-7ft-5in-liu-chuanxing-tipped-to-hit-heights-in-australian-basketball", "last_update": "2021-11-01T15:33:49Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Morrison government\u2019s emissions projections are a farce based on technological pipe dreams | Greg Jericho", "article": "The Morrison government\u2019s plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 was quickly revealed to be based on laughable projections. But even worse, the latest projections for emissions to 2030, also released last week, reveal the government has totally given up on the Paris agreement and the task to keep warming below either 1.5C or 2C. If you listened to the prime minister or read some compliant reporting over the past week you might think the latest greenhouse gas projections are a triumph. But if you examine the figures rather than the media release, it\u2019s clear that Australia\u2019s task to do our share to limit warming to either 1.5C or 2C is harder now than it was projected to be last year. First let\u2019s look at the change in projections from 2020.\nLast year, the industry department projected Australia would emit 479m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030 \u2013 22% below the 615m tonnes emitted in 2005. But the projections also included a \u201chigh technology sensitivity\u201d scenario \u2013 a scenario in which technology improved faster than expected. That projection had Australia emitting 436m tonnes of CO2 in 2030 \u2013 29% below 2005 levels. And would you believe it \u2013 technology has improved faster! As Ketan Joshi first noted, the government has effectively taken the 2020 high technology scenario and made it the baseline in 2021. That sleight of hand has the government now projecting 439m tonnes of emissions in 2030. Not only that, emissions in 2005 were revised up to 624m tonnes, giving us the 30% fall below 2005 levels by 2030:\nIf the graph does not display please click here The government insists the cuts come from measures announced in the 2021-22 budget such as \u201c$464m clean hydrogen industrial hubs program\u201d, \u201cfunding to support the development of carbon capture\u201d and measures such as the \u201cimplementation of the safeguard crediting mechanism\u201d and \u201csupport for voluntary climate action through an expanded climate active framework.\u201d If that all sounds like bunkum, it\u2019s because it is. The government\u2019s own figures show that all of the difference in actual emissions from last year\u2019s projections come from electricity \u2013 ie the shift away from coal:\nIf the graph does not display please click here It means, as the Greens leader Adam Bandt has noted, while the figures anticipate \u201cthe closure of 11GW of coal capacity\u201d, the government is simultaneously pursuing \u201celectricity subsidies, carbon capture handouts and the Collinsville coal-fired power station feasibility study, all designed to keep coal in the system for longer\u201d. Even more absurdly, these new technology improvements that will supposedly lead to greater emissions cuts are only set to occur after 2024:\nIf the graph does not display please click here The government actually predicts more emissions until 2025 than it did a year ago. The problem is that while the government keeps reducing its estimate for emissions in 2030, it also recalculates the actual emissions that have occurred since 1990 \u2013 and they keep rising.\nIf the graph does not display please click here The latest projections have Australia emitting a further 195m tonnes CO2 over the 40 years from 1990 than was projected last year. This matters because, as I have noted previously, we need to stay within our carbon budget. The Climate Change Authority has estimated that to stay under 2C, Australia could only emit 10,100m tonnes of CO2 from 2013 to 2050. The Climate Targets Panel earlier this year re-calculated it to be 10,400m tonnes. Last year\u2019s projections suggested Australia had used up 4,239m tonnes of that total. But the latest figures suggest Australia had now used 4,287m tonnes. That means our remaining budget from 2021 onwards has fallen from 6,161m to 6,113m tonnes. To stay under 1.5C, Australia can only emit 7,760m tonnes of CO2, but the latest figures suggest we now have only 3,473m tonnes remaining. To put it another way, we have used up 55% of our carbon budget for the 37 years from 2013 to 2050 in just eight years. The purpose of the Paris agreement was to hold \u201cthe increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels\u201d. The latest figures suggest we will exceed our 1.5C budget in 2027 and the 2C budget in 2034 even if after 2030 we go on a direct path to net zero by 2050:\nIf the graph does not display please click here To stay within our 1.5C budget we would need to start on a path to reach net zero by 2033 \u2013 this would require an 80% cut from 2005 levels by 2030.\nIf the graph does not display please click here Even the task for staying within our 2C budget is tough.\nOn the current projections, after 2030 we would need to cut emissions by 63m tonnes a year \u2013 nine times more than the current projections of a 7m tonnes cut each year:\nIf the graph does not display please click here By contrast a 50% cut by 2030 would then give us until 2044 to get to net zero. The latest greenhouse gas projections are a farce, based on technological pipe dreams not even reflected in the figures. But worse, they confirm that the government has effectively given up on Australia doing its share to keep temperatures from rising by more than either 1.5C or 2C. The government\u2019s own figures show that its net zero by 2050 target is nowhere near enough to limit global warming to safe levels. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2021/nov/02/the-morrison-governments-emissions-projections-are-a-farce-based-on-technological-pipe-dreams", "last_update": "2021-11-01T11:15:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},

When Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was appointed by Tottenham following a long and extremely drawn out selection process in which they were turned by Mauricio Pochettino, Antonio Conte, Paulo Fonseca, Gennaro Gattuso, Dave from Chas & Dave and several bewildered pedestrians hauled into their stadium boardroom off Tottenham High Road, he was immediately on the back foot because everyone on the planet knew he was nowhere near the club\u2019s first choice.

Reports from his native Italy suggest the man who has won titles with Juventus, Chelsea and Inter is an \u201cadvanced talks\u201d over an 18-month contract with Tottenham, presumably subject to certain cast-iron guarantees of investment in the January transfer window that are likely to cause Levy, a notoriously tough negotiator, more than a few sleepless nights. Having already stuck two metaphorical ferrets down his trousers with predictably disastrous consequences, it would be prudent for Levy to acquiesce to the demands of this particular cantankerous critter to avoid getting bitten yet again.

{"title": "Xi Jinping makes no major climate pledges in written Cop26 address", "article": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called on developed countries to \u201cprovide support to help developing countries do better\u201d in dealing with the climate crisis, in a written statement to the Cop26 climate conference that fails to make any new significant pledges. The Chinese leader also urged all parties to take stronger actions to \u201cjointly tackle the climate challenge\u201d, and said his country would \u201cspeed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations\u201d. China is the world\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key player at Cop26, the latest round of talks aimed at strengthening the fight against global heating, which began on Sunday. Despite this, Xi, who has not left China since 2020 amid the Covid pandemic, had not been expected to attend the conference in person. He was the only world leader so far to deliver remarks to the conference in written form, although another significant no-show \u2013 Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u2013 is expected to send a video message to a related UN conference on forestry and land use. \u201cWe have been very clear as hosts that we welcome everyone to participate, but it will be in-person,\u201d said Britain\u2019s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, last week.\nXi\u2019s message to Cop26 echoes his speech at the G20 summit in Rome over the weekend, in which he participated via video link. On Sunday night, he spoke to those there at length about the climate crisis, urging countries to \u201cbalance environmental protection and economic development, address climate change and safeguard people\u2019s livelihood\u201d, and saying that \u201cmajor economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard\u201d. \u201cThe G20 members should take the lead in promoting and applying advanced technologies, and developed countries should also earnestly fulfil their commitments to providing funds for developing countries,\u201d he added. In updated pledges, China confirmed to the UN last week that it would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and cut them to net zero by 2060. It also promised to raise total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 in order to reach its goals. However, climate watchers were hoping for new pledges to cap energy consumption and an earlier start to reducing the use of coal, currently scheduled to begin in 2026, adding to pressure on China from other world leaders to promise more. Last Tuesday, Macron asked Xi during a phone call to send the world a \u201cdecisive signal\u201d on the climate emergency, according to the French presidency. Xi also spoke with Boris Johnson on Friday. A Chinese government statement said the two leaders spoke about topics ranging from bilateral ties to sustainability. Xi said Beijing would \u201cdo what it says\u201d when it came to its green and low-carbon development. The statement added that he said China\u2019s goals would mean a \u201cbroad and profound economic and societal change\u201d, and that that would be done \u201cstep by step and [through] hard work\u201d.\nClimate analysts quoted by the Reuters news agency said the latest arrangement could indicate that the world\u2019s biggest CO2 producer \u201chas already decided that it has no more concessions to offer at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Scotland after three major pledges since last year\u201d. But Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv financial analysis, said the domestic situation in China should not be ignored in understanding Xi\u2019s decision to deliver the speech in a written format. \u201cComplicated domestic politics ahead of the Communist party\u2019s sixth plenum on 8-11 November in Beijing is definitely Xi\u2019s focus now. It is crucial for him to continuing a third term at the congress next autumn. And the current energy crunch in China is complicating climate policy, too,\u201d Qin said. She added that the choice of written statement was \u201calso to show China\u2019s top leadership cares about UN climate talks, but it is not its top priority\u201d. \u201cIt looks like China prefers to leave more room for negotiations in bilateral talks rather than showing all the cards at the plenary. Look at what the EU and the US just did bilaterally over Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminium this weekend.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-xi-jinping-china-president-sidesteps-videolink-written-statement", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:58:22Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Hating Peter Tatchell review \u2013 crusading activist\u2019s greatest hits", "article": "\u201cMy doctors have said very clearly: \u2018No more head injuries.\u2019\u201d So says Peter Tatchell, one of the world\u2019s most tenacious, divisive and necessary activists, as he prepares to fly to Moscow in 2018 to protest against state-sanctioned homophobia. The trip, which returns him to the city where he was beaten and arrested in 2007, forms one of the few present-tense sections of this greatest hits-style documentary. Tatchell has sustained numerous injuries from his lifetime of protest, though claims of memory loss are comically undermined during a kid-gloves interview with Ian McKellen. \u201cFifty two years of civil disobedience, Peter!\u201d gasps the actor admiringly. \u201cFifty three now,\u201d Tatchell replies, unable to resist the lure of being right. As of this year, it\u2019s 54. Tatchell was already an activist when he moved from Melbourne to London in 1971 at the age of 19. Among other achievements, he went on to stage the first gay rights protest in a communist country (East Germany, 1973), co-found the gay pressure group OutRage!, and attempt citizen\u2019s arrests of Robert Mugabe (London, 1999 and Brussels, 2001). The former MP Chris Smith correctly identifies those run-ins with the Zimbabwean dictator as turning points which softened public hostility toward Tatchell. How best to describe him? Is he \u201ca performance artist\u201d (as Stephen Fry says)? \u201cA brave motherfucker\u201d (singer and DJ Tom Robinson)? Or \u201ca little bit of an irritant\u201d (Smith)? Dr George Carey, the former archbishop of Canterbury, calls him \u201ca bullying kind of chap\u201d, but then he would say that: it was Carey\u2019s 1998 Easter Sunday sermon that was hijacked by Tatchell, who rushed the pulpit to protest at the Church\u2019s disdain for lesbian and gay rights.\nAnalysis is thin on the ground in this chummy but functional film, with any ambiguity fleeting or accidental. Footage of the 1983 Bermondsey byelection, for instance, at which Tatchell stood as a Labour candidate and lost after a homophobic campaign against him, shows him modifying his delivery on the doorstep, his clipped Aussie tones peppered with glottal stops and gor-blimey cheer. Why not ask about that? A ubiquitous score guides the viewer\u2019s responses, and we get a bog-standard 1980s montage (Thatcher, royal wedding, Band Aid). One highlight is the footage of the 1990s \u201ckiss-ins\u201d organised by OutRage!, at which gay protesters risked prosecution by snogging in front of police and cameras. If only the film-makers had bothered to identify Derek Jarman during his 20 seconds or so of screen time, rather than reducing Britain\u2019s foremost queer film director to Man in Crowd.\nThose unfamiliar with Tatchell or unconvinced of his significance will still find the film a decent place to start, though it remains a timid, by-the-book portrait of a man who is anything but. \u2022 Hating Peter Tatchell screens at the Raindance film festival, and is available on Netflix.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/01/hating-peter-tatchell-review-documentary-gay-rights", "last_update": "2021-11-01T09:17:35Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "English exam boards may be asked to avoid \u2018complex language\u2019", "article": "Exam boards could be asked to avoid using \u201ccomplex language\u201d including colloquialisms, sarcasm and idioms in assessments to make them more accessible for pupils. Ofqual, the exams regulator in England, has published draft guidance aimed at tackling the ways in which some pupils are \u201cunfairly disadvantaged by irrelevant features\u201d in exams, making it harder to determine their knowledge, skills and understanding. This includes pupils who are deaf, blind, autistic and dyslexic, as well as those who have English as an additional language, and those who are unfamiliar with certain humour and customs, as well as housing, family arrangements and certain cultural, social or travel experiences. The guidance, on which Ofqual is seeking views until 24 January, could come into force in spring 2022 if approved. It would especially apply to assessments that are not seeking to assess the understanding of complex language, such as for maths or other numerical skills-based subjects. The document recommends that exam boards replace abstract nouns, colloquialisms, metaphors, idioms and sarcasm with language that is \u201caccessible, clear and plain\u201d as well as \u201cunambiguous\u201d. It adds that source material, context, images and colour in an exam should not \u201cuse unnecessary negative, narrow or stereotypical representations of particular groups\u201d, nor should it \u201cadvantage of disadvantage any group\u201d of pupils, for example, by relating disproportionately to a particular socioeconomic context where this is not relevant to the assessment. The document further proposes that images be used only when integral to the assessment, since these can be open to interpretation, while layouts should be accessible and schools should improve their use of assistive technology. The draft guidance further discourages schools from setting more demanding tasks at the beginning of the exam, which might \u201cdemotivate\u201d some learners and prevent them from fully demonstrating the required knowledge in the rest of the exam. Jo Saxton, Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, said: \u201cThe best interests of students are the compass that guides us. We regulate so that assessments enable every student to demonstrate what they know, understand and can do \u2013 without unnecessary barriers. It is crucial that assessments are as accessible as possible for all students.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/nov/01/english-exam-boards-may-be-asked-to-avoid-complex-language", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:14:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Burps, branches and bold exploration \u2013 Laced/Cut & Mix review", "article": "In the corner of New Art Exchange in Nottingham, I pop on a cassette tape and listen to multidisciplinary artist Simnikiwe Buhlungu. She tells me her feet are wet and that she\u2019s lost and about self-determination. But it is her proclamation about togetherness that catches my attention: \u201cself can be a community,\u201d she explains. In a world where the individual is prized, hitching the concept of identity to external forces seems radical and risky. But this is exactly what Laced \u2013 a group exhibition of seven female artists with links to Africa and its diasporas \u2013 asks us to attempt. On a basic level, we are all aware of the ways in which others have shaped us \u2013 the way we intonate like our parents or vote like our friends. Laced dials it up a few notches, uncovering links to history and geography, spreading connections out across the gallery like the delicately threaded textile the exhibition is named after. My green jumper starts to disappear into the green walls, which blends into Zohra Opoku\u2019s photograph of lush foliage. Beneath the branches is an obscured female figure \u2013 I catch a glimpse of her eye, she stares back at me \u2013 and her immersion in the landscape questions my own relationship with the natural world.\nThe seven artists\u2019 work responds to a poetic text formulated by curator Loren Hansi Gordon to weave together a broad selection of ideas. Laced is about race (\u201chow we wear our hair\u201d), Nottingham (\u201chistory of this place\u201d), liberty (\u201cthe art of being free\u201d), heart (\u201clove is as love does\u201d) and fundamentally how we are able \u201cto find ourselves in the other\u201d. This plethora of concepts is articulated through thick swirls of paint, colloquial dialogue, bold photography, delicate needlework and hypnotising animation by artists with links across the globe. Rather than creating incoherence, the array of topics throws out endless points of connection. It is the personal in the works that reels us in. Buhlungu\u2019s recordings of walks include profound ponderings, observations about location, burps and songs to generate a meandering monologue that reflects the spontaneous way in which all minds travel. Wura-Natasha Ogunji\u2019s exquisite stitched human figures depict emotions that words can\u2019t reach, while Michaela Yearwood-Dan\u2019s cacophony of dense acrylic flicks, scrapes and dabs with hidden phrases like \u201cwhen will I finally figure out what it is to be free?\u201d is joyous and volatile like the contradiction of being alive.\nConnection also means taking responsibility. Tabita Rezaire\u2019s panoramic video explores how the internet continues to perpetuate oppressive hierarchies. From the physical infrastructure \u2013 the routes of which mimic those of the slave traders \u2013 to the way in which Google\u2019s algorithm\u2019s suggestions include \u201cwhy is Africa poor\u201d and \u201cwhy Africans don\u2019t wear deodorant\u201d, Rezaire condenses history to illustrate how interconnectivity can be abusive and how our past shapes our present. \u201cWest needs new spaces to conquer\u201d stretches out across the screen, challenging us to acknowledge the ills of previous generations and how our quest to defend \u201cpower at all costs\u201d is far from over. A quirk of Covid rescheduling means that upstairs another seven artists tackle the topic of Black British masculinities in Cut & Mix. Dialogues naturally open up between the two exhibitions, and the similarities between Amartey Golding\u2019s flower-obscured Black men and Opoku\u2019s fauna-hidden women narrate how excessively restrictive gender identities have negative implications on both sides of the coin. The need for women to appear a certain way boxes men into a corner too.\nFor Black men, this corner is smaller than ever \u2013 as many of the works in Cut & Mix reveal. Heavyweight Champ by Antonio Roberts features recoded video games with Black characters from fighting games. Balrog from Street Fighter II races across a Mario game, while Adam Hunter from Streets of Rage pops up i Donkey Kong. Later, Beverley Bennett places the words of female musicians in the mouths of male gospel singers, Marlene Smith wears the clothes of her late father and Michael Forbes juxtaposes multicoloured wigs and diamante-adorned hats with stern facial expressions. Reframing not only exposes the narrow and restrictive path Black men are often required to walk, it also offers an alternative where vulnerability, sensitivity and flamboyancy have a place. At the back of the gallery is a dimly lit orange room. Bennett\u2019s gospel singers and the aroma from a scented diffuser fill the air as I look at a photographic portrait by Rotimi Fani-Kayode. Two Black men stand close, facing the camera \u2013 the first, draped in a red robe, looks heavenward \u2013 while the second nuzzles into his shoulder. The certainty and stillness of the first man allays the concerns of the second, offering him a place of refuge and rest. Senses alight in the warm, closed space, it is as though I have stumbled upon a chapel at the end of a long journey. With a head full of ideas, I too wish to rest upon this man\u2019s shoulder. Connection is not easy, but it is all we have.

{"title": "Poem of the week: Before the Map by Carola Luther", "article": "Before the Map At night, I feel at home with these hills. They lie down beside me like cattle in the dirt they are in. I call them in the dark and they shift like cattle do, Sanga cows, or Highland cows, like kine, like kin. I know I\u2019m not the only one. Secretly at night they settle down by each of us, keep us warm, and in. These are the names I give them: Kith. Oom. Sough. Ox. Gert. Brute. Tlou. Seth. Olifant Cough. Olifant Bone.\nCarola Luther was born and brought up in rural South Africa, came to England in 1981 and currently lives in West Yorkshire. When writing about her local environment in her third collection, On the Way to Jerusalem Farm, she often senses complications in the pastoral scene. Besides forebodings of ecological disaster, anxiety flows in from current world events and takes hallucinatory shape: in Balance, for example, an abandoned tractor becomes \u201ca wrecked boat leaning / under the weight of birds\u201d, while in Sheep, the single, terrified animal racing towards her begins to resemble a young woman fleeing for her life. Luther\u2019s pastoral is prone to disorientation and estrangement. But such estrangement has a positive side: it heightens colour and light, and sometimes sets a strand of mythic-animal storytelling in progress. In this week\u2019s poem, Before the Map, enrichment flows directly from the past, both in terms of pre-linguistic consciousness and the discovery and rediscovery of language. Feeling \u201cat home\u201d with the hills depends on the writer\u2019s not having found out their written names. The map is still close-folded, places haven\u2019t been dislodged or penned in by naming. The hills \u201clie down beside me like cattle / in the dirt they are in\u201d. They are \u201cof\u201d as well as \u201cin\u201d the dirt. Their presence prompts an early memory, and the speaker seems at home with the way \u201cthey shift\u201d when their names are called in the dark. Two breeds are mentioned, \u201cSanga cows, or Highland cows \u2026\u201d Sanga cattle are the indigenous cattle of sub-Saharan Africa; Highland cattle originally migrated from Africa and Europe to settle in Scotland and the Outer Hebrides. The difference between the breeds is unimportant. The hills resemble both, and, as \u201ckine\u201d they evolve easily into \u201ckin\u201d. \u201cI know I\u2019m not the only one\u201d seems a glad rather than grudging recognition. Humans become herd creatures now in the third tercet, linked in wider kinship. The cattle \u201csettle down by each of us\u201d like protective ancestral spirits. The last line of the third tercet satisfyingly takes up and revises the preposition (\u201cin\u201d) from the first line. People are safely contained. The hills \u201ckeep us warm, and in\u201d. Luther\u2019s assortment of names emphasises consonantal variety. The sounds slumberous cattle make are evoked in \u201cSough\u201d and \u201cOx\u201d. \u201cGert\u201d shortens the old name \u201cGertrude\u201d, that of the German Benedictine nun and saint, adding various associations of female strength and tenacity. \u201cKith\u201d echoes with the earlier terms, kine and kin; \u201cBrute\u201d has the heft of a bull. \u201cSeth\u201d has biblical connotations: it was the name of Adam and Eve\u2019s third son, thought by Eve to be God\u2019s replacement for the murdered Abel. There\u2019s also a working-class ring to these once popular English-adopted Christian names. Luther draws some of the cattle names from her South African heritage. An end-note tells us that \u201cOom\u201d means \u201cuncle\u201d in Afrikaans, and that \u201cTlou\u201d and \u201cOlifant\u201d mean elephant \u201cin Sesotho and Afrikaans respectively\u201d. Even in this gentle pastoral, death is present. \u201cOlifant Cough\u201d may suggest that the animal, displaced in a northern climate, has caught cold, and \u201cOlifant Bone\u201d inevitably signals either natural death or the work of hunters and poachers. At the same time, the cough may simply be a harmless sound, and bone might indicate the living structure that has sturdily made its home in the changing hills of Luther\u2019s imagination. \u2022 A spelling mistake in the caption has been amended.

Now the roof on the novelist\u2019s own home is set to be restored, after funds were raised to save it through public donations and a grant from the government. Austen lived in Chawton, Hampshire, for the last eight years of her life, writing novels including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Emma there \u2013 \u201cNobody can be more devoted to home than I am,\u201d continues the attention-seeking Mrs Elton in the latter.

{"title": "Jes Staley: why did the FCA investigate and are its findings public?", "article": "Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 chief executive for the past six years, is stepping down after City regulators shared with him and the bank preliminary findings of an investigation over how he described his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. However, Staley plans to challenge the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) over their conclusions, meaning it could take much longer before the findings are released to the public. We take a closer look at what we know about the case and its consequences so far.\nWhat does the investigation cover? According to Barclays, the investigation focused on the way Staley characterised his relationship with Epstein to Barclays, and how Barclays subsequently described that relationship to the FCA when asked for further information. The FCA has not commented on the scope of the investigation, or its preliminary findings, which have been shared with Staley and Barclays but have yet to be released to the public. What prompted the investigation? The joint FCA and PRA inquiry was launched after emails between Staley and Epstein were handed to the UK regulators by their counterparts in the US. Those emails were reportedly supplied by JP Morgan Chase and dated to Staley\u2019s time at the US bank. According to the Financial Times, which first reported on the correspondence, the emails suggested their relationship was friendly. JP Morgan and Barclays have declined to comment on the emails. \u201cObviously I thought I knew him well, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Staley told reporters last year when the investigation was made public. \u201cAnd for sure with hindsight of what we know now, I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d What do we know about Staley\u2019s relationship with Epstein? The American banker has said he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000, when he was hired to lead JP Morgan\u2019s private bank, which handles wealthy clients. However, Staley stayed in contact with Epstein for seven years after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, and visited Epstein in Florida while he was still serving his sentence and on work release in 2009. He continued his relationship with Epstein after he left JPMorgan to join hedge fund BlueMountain Capital in 2013, but claims the relationship started to taper off after he left the bank. The two men met for a final time in 2015, when Staley took his own yacht, the Bequia, to visit Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island. Staley volunteered to explain his ties to Epstein to Barclays in summer 2019, when media reports cast a fresh spotlight on their relationship. It is still not clear why Staley decided to cut ties with his former banking client. Epstein died in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking underage girls. A US medical examiner ruled he killed himself. Has Staley been implicated in other controversies since joining Barclays in 2015? Yes. Staley was personally fined almost \u00a3650,000, and ordered to repay \u00a3500,000 of his bonus, for twice attempting to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Staley used the bank\u2019s internal security unit to try to discover who had written letters to the board regarding a new hire at Barclays, who was also a former friend and colleague of Staley\u2019s at JP Morgan. Staley apologised to the bank\u2019s board after the investigation. Later in 2017, Staley caused a rift between private equity giant KKR and Barclays after backing his brother-in-law in a complicated legal dispute with the buyout house. While Staley argued that he was involved in a personal capacity, rather than as chief executive of Barclays, it strained the bank\u2019s relationship with one of its longtime clients. When will we learn more about the City regulators\u2019 findings? That is still unclear. The FCA usually shares preliminary findings with the subjects of its investigation about a month before releasing them to the public and issuing any potential fines or penalties. While most companies tend to accept and settle the investigation, often resulting in smaller fines, Staley plans to contest the findings by bringing the case to the FCA\u2019s regulatory decisions committee (RDC). Staley could also appeal to the RDC to keep the document under wraps on privacy grounds, while the process gets under way. If he wins, and argues for privacy, it is possible that the details of the investigation are never publicly released. It is not yet clear on which grounds Staley plans to challenge the findings.

{"title": "Jair Bolsonaro booed and cheered as he is honoured by Italian town", "article": "Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was met with cheers and jeers as he visited a small Italian town on Monday to collect honorary citizenship. Bolsonaro\u2019s great-grandfather was born in Anguillara Veneta, a town of 4,200 people in the Veneto region. Tensions have been brewing since its far-right mayor, Alessandra Buoso, approved granting honorary citizenship to the far-right leader. Last week, protesters spray-painted the wall of the town hall with the words \u201cBolsonaro Out\u201d while the bishop of nearby Padua described the honorary citizenship as \u201ca great embarrassment\u201d. Bolsonaro arrived in Anguillara Veneta after attending the G20 summit in Rome, where he was filmed walking around the city\u2019s cultural sites and sampling food.\nHe was greeted with cheers by supporters who had wrapped themselves in the Brazilian flag, while about 200 protesters held banners saying: \u201cJustice for the Amazon\u201d and \u201cNo citizenship for dictators\u201d. The visit comes days after Brazilian senators recommended that Bolsonaro face criminal charges for the country\u2019s more than 600,000 Covid-19 deaths. Andrea Zanoni, an environment councillor in the Veneto region for the centre-left Democratic party, was among the protesters. Zanoni said the honorary citizenship was an \u201cincomprehensible choice\u201d amid accusations of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d against Bolsonaro and his \u201cnefarious\u201d handling of the pandemic. \u201cBut not only that: Bolsonaro\u2019s policies are a disaster for the planet,\u201d said Zanoni. \u201cHe has laid out the red carpet for multinationals that are devastating the Amazon and dismantled environmental controls. Bolsonaro\u2019s policies are dangerous not only for Brazil but the whole world.\u201d The ANPI, an Italian anti-fascism organisation, described the visit and citizenship as \u201cshameful\u201d. Buoso, from the far-right League party, defended the decision, saying the move was not a vote on Bolsonaro\u2019s politics but a recognition of the Italians who had emigrated to Brazil, like Bolsonaro\u2019s great-grandfather Vittorio, who was 10 when his family emigrated to Brazil. The Italian press reported that hosting Bolsonaro and his entourage had cost the town\u2019s council about \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,500). Later, police used water cannons to disperse 500 protesters who reportedly tried to break through a security cordon outside the Basilica of Saint Anthony in Padua, where Bolsonaro travelled to after Anguillara Veneta. Bolsonaro\u2019s approval ratings have slumped before his 2022 reelection campaign, in large part because of the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll, which is the second highest in the world. Last week, the Brazilian senate committee formally approved a report calling for prosecutors to try Bolsonaro on charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/jair-bolsonaro-booed-and-cheered-as-he-is-honoured-by-italian-town", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:46:55Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "John Oliver on homelessness: \u2018It is not the housed\u2019s comfort that needs to be prioritized\u2019", "article": "On Sunday\u2019s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver delved into the issue of homelessness in the US, which has been on the rise, particularly since the upheavals of the pandemic; experts project that the pandemic recession will increase chronic homelessness by 49% over the next four years, and cause twice the homelessness as the Great Recession.\nYet \u201cfar too often, stories focusing on homelessness are presented solely through the lens of how it affects those with homes, when in reality it is obviously the people without them who need the real help,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThe story of homelessness in this country is grounded in a failure of perception compounded by failures of policy,\u201d he continued. That policy, at least in its modern context, dates back to Ronald Reagan, who \u201ccame to power at a time when homelessness was increasing, and made the problem far worse by cutting programs for the poor and slashing housing subsidies by 75%\u201d, and once lamented in a 1984 interview \u201cthe homeless who are homeless, you might say, by choice\u201d.\n\u201cThat notion that homelessness isn\u2019t related to economic policy, but simply reflects the problems of the individuals experiencing it, still informs the way it\u2019s discussed today,\u201d Oliver said. There are, he continued, numerous reasons why someone might be without housing: medical debt, job loss, fleeing domestic violence, kicked out of their homes for their sexuality, being recently released from prison, or just because housing costs are rising much faster than wages. Given that 70% of low-income families are spending half their income on rent, and only 37 affordable and available homes exist for every 100 extremely low-income renter households, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take much for people to suddenly find themselves without stable housing,\u201d said Oliver. Yet focus tends to be on homelessness\u2019s impact on housed residents; Oliver pointed to numerous stories about human feces next to homeless encampments in Los Angeles, a city which before the pandemic had only 16 mobile toilet stations, hauled away at night, for its 36,000 homeless residents. \u201cSo the next time you complain about human shit in the street, maybe think about what it would be like if someone padlocked your bathroom every night,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cYou too would suddenly be getting really creative really fast.\u201d The lack of public restrooms in many cities is one symptom of what Oliver explained as \u201cthe impulse behind many local policies surrounding unhoused people\u201d \u2013 not to help them, but \u201cto punish them for their existence and keep them out of sight\u201d, such as hostile architecture designed to keep people from sitting or lying down, or in the case of one Florida city, blasting the children\u2019s song \u201cRaining Tacos\u201d to prevent homeless people from sleeping at a pavilion at night. In addition, local ordinances that criminalize the behavior of homeless people \u2013 panhandling, sitting down on public or private property \u2013 have landed many unhoused people in a cycle of incarceration. \u201cYou cannot arrest someone out of homelessness in the same way you can\u2019t sing someone out of bankruptcy,\u201d Oliver argued. \u201cOne thing doesn\u2019t remotely lead to the other, and you\u2019re just going to end up making things worse.\u201d As for solutions, Oliver had a straightforward answer: give unhoused people homes. \u201cSome will say sure, giving the homeless homes is an obvious solution, but before that they need to be sober and have a job, but it\u2019s just not that simple,\u201d he explained. \u201cSet aside that dealing with sobriety or your mental health issues is hard enough when you are not living on the streets, getting a job is often if not contingent on, at least aided by having an address.\u201d Which is why advocates support an approach called housing first, which prioritizes getting people a place to live along with services such as mental health care, counseling and job training. Such a program led the number of homeless veterans to drop from 74,000 in 2010 to 38,000 in 2018.\nSupportive housing programs are expensive, he argued, but not as expensive as current approaches to homelessness, such as incarceration. \u201cIf your primary argument against housing for the homeless was purely monetary, congratulations, your concerns have been answered. Also, a pre-congratulations for being visited by three ghosts this upcoming Christmas Eve.\u201d But funding is not the only problem \u2013 another obstacle to supportive housing programs is the nimby problem \u2013 Not In My Backyard, when residents support a program in theory, just not in practice when it\u2019s near their home. Oliver derided nimbyism as unhelpful self-absorption \u2013 \u201cit is not the housed\u2019s comfort that needs to be prioritized right now. So if you\u2019re wondering why homelessness continues to get worse in this country, one reason is that there are a lot of people, even liberals, who believe that homelessness is a personal failing, poverty can be avoided and their own good fortune makes them not only better than the unhoused, but more worthy of comfort. It is basically Reagan\u2019s attitude from a Whole Foods crowd.\u201d Oliver said he didn\u2019t want to oversimplify the logistics, as \u201cit will take a massive commitment in infrastructure, funding and resources. But the very first step here is a collective change of perceptions. \u201cBasically, we need to stop being dicks and assuming that the unhoused are a collection of drug addict criminals who\u2019ve chosen this life for themselves,\u201d he concluded, \u201cinstead of people suffering the inevitable consequences of gutted social programs and a nationwide divestment from affordable housing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/01/john-oliver-homelessness-us", "last_update": "2021-11-01T15:37:43Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The Scottish alt-rock trio bring together scabrous guitar riffs, quirky rhythms and frontman Simon Neil\u2019s feral vocals to thrilling effect, packing all this and more into a sprawling, 23-song set here. Originally booked for April, a six-month postponement for this tour allowed the band to put together new album The Myth of the Happily Ever After, that they say is a reaction to their previous release, 2020\u2019s A Celebration of Endings. New songs DumDum and A Hunger In Your Haunt are received as voraciously as staples Mountains and That Golden Rule. In keeping with the spirit of the evening \u2013 part of a tour of relatively intimate venues \u2013 the band do away with the latter\u2019s prominent string section, but their audience is more than happy to follow Neil\u2019s lead and sing the parts themselves. Biffy Clyro are no longer the dissonant, post-hardcore outfit that started in Kilmarnock in the mid-90s, but their heavy credentials remain. Errors In the History of God builds nicely towards an extended version of its crushing, sludgy outro, and Unknown Male 01 is quintessential Biffy: flapping, down-tuned riffs flanked by jazz hand verses and soaring choruses. Such is the hulking volume that erupts through the room during Wolves of Winter you could quite easily be watching the band at the city\u2019s arena three miles up the road. Underrated sibling rhythm section James and Ben Johnston are to thank for that. They\u2019re crucial once again during Slurpy Slurpy Sleep Sleep, where dreamy synth passages make way for a hypnotising, thrashing crescendo. The only thing louder than the deafening roars that greet Bubbles is the near-constant chanting of \u201cYorkshire\u201d and \u201cMon the Biff\u201d throughout. 2022 will no doubt see the band return to arenas and a slew of festival headline slots, given they still offer something few other bands do: brains and brawn in equal measure.

{"title": "Jersey issues 49 more fishing licences to French boats amid row ", "article": "Jersey has issued another 49 licences to French boats in an apparent attempt to de-escalate a post-Brexit row over fishing rights in which the UK and France have issued tit-for-tat threats. The Jersey government said it was allowing another round of temporary licences until the end of January to allow time for new arrangements to be put in place, as the two sides prepared to meet to try to resolve the row. The European Commission has said officials from France, Britain, Jersey, Guernsey and the commission will meet on Monday afternoon in Brussels. A spokesperson said the meeting, which was called by the commission, aimed for \u201ca swift solution on the outstanding issues\u201d. Earlier the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, warned France it had 48 hours to back down on threats made in the row over fishing licences or Britain would begin dispute talks set out in the Brexit deal. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has previously issued the UK with a deadline of Tuesday to make a move to allow more French boats access to fishing waters. In a post-G20 press conference, Macron said Britain must give ground or France would trigger threatened trade reprisals this week. \u201cThe ball is in Britain\u2019s court. If the British make no movement, the measures of 2 November will have to be put in place,\u201d he said. French officials have said they will bar UK fishing boats from some ports and tighten customs checks on lorries entering the country unless more licences are granted for their small boats to fish in Britain\u2019s waters. The diplomatic row over fishing, a very small sector of the economy, threatened to overshadow the G20 talks in Rome at the weekend and Cop26 in Glasgow this week. Jersey said the move would take the number of licences issued to French vessels to 162. Its government said it remained open to receiving further data for vessels that had no licence, and new applications could be submitted at any time. It is still unclear whether the extra licences will have any effect on the row. Speaking to AFP on Monday, Macron reiterated that reprisals \u201cwill take effect at midnight tonight\u201d if the two sides failed to achieve a breakthrough. Almost 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in UK waters, equating to 98% of EU applications for fishing licences, the UK government says, but this figure is disputed in Paris. Truss suggested on Monday that Macron may be making \u201cunreasonable threats\u201d because he has a difficult election looming. Asked about whether France and the UK had come to an agreement, Truss told Sky News: \u201cThe deal hasn\u2019t been done. The French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry and they need to withdraw those threats.\u201d She said that if the French did not withdraw the threats, the UK government would use \u201cthe mechanisms of our trade agreement with the EU to take action\u201d, which \u201ccould lead to taking direct action in trade\u201d. Truss said: \u201cThe French have behaved unfairly. It\u2019s not within the terms of the trade deal. And if someone behaves unfairly in a trade deal you\u2019re entitled to take action against them and seek some compensatory measures and that is what we will do if the French don\u2019t back down. \u201c[The French must] stop threatening UK fishing vessels, stop threatening the Channel ports, and accept that we are entirely within our rights to allocate the fishing licences in line with the trade agreement, as we have done.\u201d She said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d take legal action in the coming days if France did not back down, adding: \u201cThis issue needs to be resolved in the next 48 hours.\u201d Asked why the row had emerged, Truss said: \u201cYou might say there\u2019s a French election coming up.\u201d Truss seemed angered by the dispute and said: \u201cI\u2019m not remotely happy about what has happened.\u201d Pierre-Henri Dumont, a French politician for Les R\u00e9publicains party, said France simply wanted the UK to \u201cfulfil its commitments that were made during the post-Brexit treaty\u201d. He said he thought \u201charder negotiations\u201d may need to be opened up with the British side. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat we are asking is just for the British government to fulfil and keep its promises that were made by signing this post-Brexit agreement. We\u2019re not asking any more. We\u2019re not asking for something that was not into this treaty. We\u2019re just asking for the British government to fulfil and to keep its signature.

{"title": "This fish spat with France is just another product of Johnson\u2019s broken Brexit | Simon Jenkins", "article": "As Boris Johnson stumbles from cliche to cliche in Glasgow, a boatload of French fishers are making a fool of him. Posing as a world leader, he pleads that the Earth is \u201cat one minute to midnight\u201d, and should raise its game in the last chance saloon. Yet he cannot stop France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron taunting him over a few boat licences, any more than he can handle the consequences of the Northern Irish protocol, or exert influence over the truce between the European Union and the United States on steel tariffs. Being outside the EU was meant to display Britain beating its chest across the Channel and round the world, raking in lucrative new trade. Instead at Cop26, China, Russia and India have all found better things to do than listen to Johnson\u2019s tired metaphors amid piles of rain-soaked rubbish. The fishing dispute with France is complex and unimportant, and 55% of England\u2019s fishing quota is already owned by EU vessels. The row is pure electioneering by Emmanuel Macron. But Britain has no friends in Europe and zero leverage, following the sloppy withdrawal deal reached by Johnson\u2019s belligerent chief negotiator and crony, David Frost. He has now handed Macron an election weapon, a threat to impede all trade through Channel ports. This should be an outrage.\nThe same sloppiness was evident in last year\u2019s Northern Irish protocol, which was certain to infuriate Unionists when they realised Johnson had lied to them over its implications. Now, when the EU offers Britain a genuine compromise package, as it did last month, he must pretend to hang tough over the near-trivial issue of the European court of justice, reneging on an agreement he personally signed. This too is outrageous. But it is what happens when politics strays into trade, which was precisely Johnson\u2019s doing. To rub home the point, Joe Biden has now signed a deal on steel export tariffs with the EU that naturally excludes Britain. This is allegedly to make up for the exclusion of France from the bizarre Anglo-American arms deal with Australia against China. Johnson may now plead for his own steel agreement, but he is weakened outside the EU, and American lobbyists may oppose this. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU was political. So be it. Quite different was the decision also to leave the European single market and free trade area, which was the personal choice of Johnson to aid his campaign against Theresa May. It was ill-considered and foolish. The price is now being paid by pig farmers and fruit growers, healthcare managers, transport sector recruiters, builders, hoteliers, musicians and Ulster unionists. Hardly a single gain has accrued to leaving the European market. Meanwhile, a widening 10-point gap exists between those who think Brexit a bad deal for the country against those who still think it good. Every woe currently descending on Johnson\u2019s head is attributable not to Brexit but to the loss of the single market and customs union. It is blatantly in Britain\u2019s interest to rejoin them. Continental agreements and supply chains forged more than 20 years of close relations with neighbours are not matters of great principle. They are a common interest and common sense. Abandoning them was a massive error in the name of a spurious freedom. The only question is, who has the guts to reverse it.

The charred and smouldering remains of the vehicle remained in the Newtownards area on Monday afternoon. BBC Northern Ireland reported claims from loyalists that they had carried out the attack to mark the passing of the 1 November deadline set by the DUP for walking out of the Stormont executive unless major changes to the Northern Ireland protocol had been secured. Stormont\u2019s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, said two masked men \u201cmuttered something about the protocol\u201d as they held the driver at gunpoint. \u201cTwo masked men entered the bus. They held the driver, a male, at gunpoint, they said something about the protocol, and they then proceeded to spray the inside of the bus with flammable liquid. They forced the bus driver off the bus and then they set it alight,\u201d Mallon told BBC Radio Ulster\u2019s The Nolan Show. The driver managed to get off the vehicle unharmed but was badly shaken by the incident, the police said. No passengers were on the bus at the time. The attack, which has echoes of the violence that spilled on to the streets in Belfast and Derry at Easter, was roundly condemned by all parties including the DUP, which said \u201cthuggery and terrorism will do nothing to remove the NI protocol\u201d. The party\u2019s leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said political engagement had already secured progress in relation to changes to the protocol and the talks between the EU and the UK must be allowed take their course. He said when he had set out his timeline for progress, \u201cthe EU was saying that fresh negotiations were impossible\u201d. But in an indication that Donaldson has parked his threat to walk out of Stormont, he said that since then fresh proposals had been put forward by the EU and \u201cserious negotiations have reopened with the UK government\u201d. \u201cNo reasonable person could deny that this represents significant and positive progress. That progress was secured through political action and not violence.\u201d \u201cThose engaging in thuggery only undermine these efforts and cement the protocol more firmly in place,\u201d he said.

Like many people here I\u2019ve already had a long journey, having left before 8am to get here, so there\u2019s a lot of weariness in the crowd here before we even get started but everyone is still in good spirits and just eager to get in.\u201d Protesters were gathering too. Despite the freezing cold there were a couple of small protests already taking place, including a delegation from Uganda demanding Boris Johnson take action against the president, Yoweri Museveni, who is accused of a wide range of human rights violations including environmental destruction. A large Bangladeshi crowd gathered on the edge of the River Clyde demanding that the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, stand down. The summit always attracts political protests from across the world as activists take advantage of the international attention.\nAmerican grassroots activists from the Build Back Fossil Free coalition were expected outside the Cop26 blue zone entrance to demand the US president take executive action to stop the approval of fossil fuel projects and declare a climate emergency, building on the historic People v Fossil Fuels week of action last month in Washington DC Activists are furious at Joe Biden\u2019s likely narrative of \u201cclimate leadership\u201d, which they say contradicts the daily suffering by communities on the frontline of gas and oil production in the US. In the first six months of the Biden administration, about 2,500 new oil and gas permits were authorised \u2013 a figure Donald Trump\u2019s administration took a year to reach.\nMeanwhile, inside the convention centre, it felt as if the whole world had arrived in Glasgow. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and his team headed down one corridor, while in the opposite direction officials from Rwanda, Costa Rica and the EU gathered in the area where world leaders were due to arrive and speak. International reporters were diving in with questions in several different languages. Mostly, people were trying to find their way around, meandering through the network of country pavilions, offices and coffee shops with long queues.

{"title": "Attica: the story behind the bloodiest prison riot in US history", "article": "Mention Attica and an iconic moment from Dog Day Afternoon is often top of mind. In Sidney Lumet\u2019s powder-keg film from 1975, Al Pacino\u2019s bank robber turned hostage taker yells \u201cAttica! Attica! Attica!\u201d in a standoff with police. He riles up the gathered crowds and wins sympathy for his predicament by invoking the tragedy that occurred just a few years ago, when inmates took control of Attica correctional facility in a fight for their humanity, keeping trigger happy police at bay outside the prison walls for four days.\nThere is so much to say about that Dog Day Afternoon scene, where a white man invokes a prison rebellion led largely by Black and brown men to win the support of fellow white onlookers, subsequently supplanting the harrowing real life event in cultural memory. Consider Stanley Nelson and Traci Curry\u2019s Attica an act of reclamation, then. Their powerfully empathetic, insightful and riveting documentary \u2013 airing on Showtime just over 50 years after the Attica rebellion \u2013 chronicles the events that began as a fight among inmates and guards, and immediately exploded into an incredibly organized coup with prisoners taking control of the prison and demanding national media attention.\nPrison staff were taken hostage but kept safe under the protection of Muslim prisoners. The inmates also set up security details for the news cameras that were invited inside to listen to testimonies of brutality and inhumane conditions and the back-and-forth negotiations for a peaceful resolution that never came. The doc, made up of archival footage and interviews with inmates, lawyers and journalists on scene, also skillfully weaves in the cultural fabric that led to what is still the bloodiest prison rebellion in US history. \u201cWhat happened inside Attica resonated with what was happening outside Attica in 1971,\u201d Curry told the Guardian on a Zoom call alongside Nelson. She explains that many of the inmates at Attica included members of radical groups like Black Panthers, the Weather Underground and the Young Lords, who would educate fellow prisoners and spread the spirit of activism that was prevalent across the nation during the Vietnam war. Curry, who began her collaborations with Nelson as a producer on a handful of recent projects before stepping into a co-director role on this film, adds that Attica was resonating with the reality outside her own Brooklyn apartment while they were making the film in 2020. \u201cIt really crystallized what this film was all about, watching George Floyd protests happening outside my window,\u201d says Curry. She talks about witnessing police descending on protesters from her apartment. She compares Donald Trump\u2019s attack on peaceful protesters near the White House to York governor Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s political opportunism while handling Attica. She compares the disregard for life and humanity in Attica to the early days of the pandemic in US prisons, where Covid-19 outbreaks ravage the incarcerated population. \u201cAttica is an invitation for us to reconsider a lot of what we\u2019re willing to allow the state to do in our name today.\u201d Attica, the film, also feels like a continuation and cumulation of the documentaries Nelson has been making for more than three decades. Whether directing on his own or collaborating with others, Nelson has been building a tapestry that captures so many vital stories in African American history and daily life.\n\u201cI would feel very strongly that people should make films about the communities that they\u2019re from and something that they know about and get into in a deeper way,\u201d says Nelson, who was 20 when Attica happened. \u201cI remember the utter shock and devastation when it ended up the way it ended up.\u201d Nelson is speaking from his office in Harlem, with the multiple Emmy and Peabody awards he accumulated over the years strategically framed around him. I can also spy the National Medal in the Humanities he received from Barack Obama way in the back. Nelson\u2019s first film, 1989\u2019s Two Dollars and A Dream, was a biography on cosmetics entrepreneur Madame CJ Walker, the first female self-made millionaire. That story bears a family connection to the film-maker. Nelson\u2019s grandfather FB Ransom was Walker\u2019s attorney and the general manager of her enterprise. His mother, A\u2019Lelia Nelson, became the company\u2019s president for a time. Nelson\u2019s film-making career essentially began with a story in his DNA before expanding out. He made biographies on Marcus Garvey and Miles Davis along with docs that celebrated Black press, activists and colleges. His most recent film, the Netflix documentary Crack: Cocaine, Corruption & Conspiracy, covered the institutional failures behind the crack epidemic that led to the mass incarceration of so many Black people. Nelson\u2019s films also have a tendency to speak to each other. His 2014 documentary Freedom Summer, about a 1964 drive to encourage African American voter registration, ends with civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael yelling \u201cBlack Power!\u201d And his follow-up film, The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution, coincidentally begins with the same chant. But that\u2019s an unintentional consequence of chronicling the African-American experience throughout a century and stumbling on echoes and overlaps. These stories simply don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. \u201cWhat we have gone through, what we\u2019re going through in this culture, is all tied up together,\u201d says Nelson. And so it goes that the stories of institutional failures, passionate activism and Black self-determination featured in Nelson\u2019s past work are also elements in Attica, which in many ways feels like a compelling, all-encompassing microcosm of America.\nThere\u2019s another element to the Attica story that resonates today. The protests and racial reckoning of the past year happened because a young woman named Darnella Frazier stood by and recorded George Floyd\u2019s murder. Her act of witnessing mobilized the country. The cameras served a similar function at Attica. The inmates, Nelson reminds, called the media and their TV cameras into the prison. They did that so the nation could hear them speak their truth and the cameras can serve as witness. \u201cThey thought that if the news media came in and filmed it, they would be protected,\u201d says Nelson, \u201cand thank God they did.\u201d His documentary is built from all that visceral, on-the-ground footage from fifty-years ago, continuing the act of witnessing the inmates pushed for back then. \u201cIt makes us able to tell the story of Attica in a way that we can\u2019t in any other prison uprising in this country. We could tell the story of Attica when we could see it.\u201d Attica is now out in US cinemas and will air on Showtime on 6 November with a UK date to be announced", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/01/attica-prison-riot-documentary-showtime", "last_update": "2021-11-01T15:37:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "David Attenborough urges leaders at Cop26 to be \u2018motivated by hope not fear\u2019", "article": "Sir David Attenborough has called on leaders at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow to be \u201cmotivated by hope rather than fear\u201d to avoid climate catastrophe. Speaking in front of an audience that included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference\u2019s opening ceremony on Monday afternoon, the broadcaster and naturalist said humanity was \u201calready in trouble\u201d. He also appealed to the political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Attenborough said: \u201cEverything we have achieved in the last 10,000 years has been enabled because of the [climate] stability during this time. \u201cThe global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either plus or minus one degree celsius \u2013 until now.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWe are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking. \u201cThis story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today those who have done the least to cause this problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable. \u201cIs this how our story is due to end? A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals?\u201d He added his voice to increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a commitment to the 1.5C temperature limit and called on young people to \u201crewrite our story\u201d. \u201cPerhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTo turn this tragedy into a triumph \u2013 we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. \u201cWe now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse. \u201cWe must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air, we must fix our sights on keeping 1.5 degrees within reach.\u201d Attenborough also highlighted the fact that \u201cno nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable\u201d, and demanded \u201call nations have a good standard of living and a modest footprint\u201d. He concluded: \u201cIt comes down to this. The people alive now and the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing \u2013 did the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here? \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. If working apart we are forces powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it.\u201d He added: \u201cThat desperate hope \u2026 is why the world is looking to you and why you are here.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/david-attenborough-urges-leaders-at-cop26-to-be-motivated-by-hope-not-fear", "last_update": "2021-11-01T14:56:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},

The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on a survey of 881 people in England in late September and early October, show that only 75% of respondents aged 35 to 54 complied with the full rules around self-isolation for the 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus. The number is down substantially from the 86% compliance reported by the ONS in July, and suggests that those in their mid-30s to mid-50s are now the least able, or least likely, of any age group to abide by the full requirements of self-isolation after a positive result.\nHints of lower compliance were also seen in older people, with adherence to self-isolation falling marginally in those aged 55 and over from 81% in the summer to 78% in recent weeks, according to the ONS survey. Evidence for an opposing trend was seen in younger people, with 82% of 18- to 34-year-olds reporting full compliance with self-isolation rules in the latest survey, up from 75% in the summer. The findings came as further ONS data gathered between January and September 2021 showed that unvaccinated people were 32 times more likely to die from Covid than fully vaccinated individuals. The latest round of the ONS self-isolation survey collected responses from adults in England between 27 September and 2 October. The ONS said the statistics were \u201cexperimental\u201d and based on a small number of respondents who reported their own behaviour, so should be treated with caution. Overall, the ONS estimates that 78% of individuals who have a positive Covid test follow the full requirements for self-isolation, a similar rate to the 79% seen in the previous round of the survey in July. However, the ONS said the compliance rate was \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than levels seen earlier in the year, such as 84% in April and 86% in May. About one-third (34%) of those who tested positive for Covid reported that isolating had a negative effect on their mental health, down from 42% in July. \u201cToday\u2019s results highlight the majority of those testing positive for Covid-19 adhere to self-isolation requirements, though there has been a decrease since April and May earlier this year,\u201d said Tim Gibbs, head of the ONS public services analysis team. \u201cAs we continue into the winter months, it is important we monitor general adherence to self-isolation requirements, which wouldn\u2019t be possible without our respondents,\u201d he added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/one-in-four-35--to-54-year-olds-in-england-not-complying-with-covid-self-isolation", "last_update": "2021-11-01T14:47:08Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Darktrace shares plunge again as investor lock-up ends", "article": "Shares in the cybersecurity firm Darktrace have plummeted again after an analyst note raising doubts about its valuation and as the expiry looms of a lock-up on insiders selling their stakes. The Cambridge-based firm, which had been a star performer since floating in April and joining the FTSE 100 last week, closed down 121p at 698p on Monday, a fall of more than 15% that valued the company at \u00a34.7bn. Its shares first began to dive last week after an analyst note from Peel Hunt questioned its sky-high valuation. The note raised a range of issues, including that some customers of Darktrace, which uses artificial intelligence to create digital security products to keep businesses one step ahead of hackers and viruses, had described its technology as \u201csnake oil\u201d. The company, which is run by its 39-year old co-founder Poppy Gustafsson, has lost about \u00a32bn from its market capitalisation within a week. Last month, Gustafsson, a high profile female executive in the male-dominated tech scene, took part in a government event promoting investment in Britain held at Windsor Castle where she was pictured meeting the Queen. The company\u2019s shares had come close to hitting 1,000p in recent weeks, valuing the business at nearly \u00a37bn, quadruple the 250p it began trading at when it made its debut on the London Stock Exchange. Darktrace\u2019s latest share price fall \u2013 the largest in the FTSE 100 \u2013 comes as a 180-day lock on investors who were onboard at the flotation selling their shares ends on Wednesday. Investors who could offload stakes include the British tech billionaire Mike Lynch, Darktrace\u2019s first and largest shareholder pre-float, who sold the software group Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard for \u00a38.4bn in 2011.\nLynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, own a 16.2% stake in Darktrace, worth about \u00a3780m, and are its second-largest shareholders. Lynch is appealing against his extradition to the US, where he is accused of fraudulently inflating the value of Autonomy before its sale to HP, and also awaits judgment in a $5bn civil fraud trial brought by HP. He denies any wrongdoing in either case. Last Monday, two days before Darktrace replaced Morrisons in the FTSE 100 after the acquisition of the supermarket chain by the US private equity group CD&R, an analyst note titled Reality Check by the city brokers Peel Hunt wiped more than a fifth of the company\u2019s market cap. The note warned that there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the company\u2019s valuation and its growth prospects. \u201cWhile we believe strong growth rates will continue, we also see a disconnect between valuation and the ultimate revenue opportunity,\u201d the note said. \u201cHaving considered the potential market size, the intensifying competition, and Darktrace\u2019s limited [research and development] spend, we take a more grounded approach to our valuation, giving a target price of 473p.\u201d Darktrace joins a string of companies that initially enjoyed a pandemic boom \u2013 including fashion businesses Asos, Boohoo and The Hut Group, as well as grocery delivery business Ocado and spread-betting firm CMC Markets \u2013 to lose their shine among investors in recent months. Darktrace, which has almost 6,000 customers, said revenues grew 50.8% year-on-year in the quarter to the end of September, significantly slower than the almost quadrupling in share price the company had enjoyed until last week. \u201cDarktrace uses cutting-edge AI technology to protect almost 6,000 customers worldwide, of which 1,500 signed up in the last year,\u201d said a spokesperson for the firm. \u201cThis self-learning AI, which learns the digital fingerprint of an organisation, defends across every industry sector \u2013 from critical national infrastructure through to global banks and corporations.

{"title": "LSO/Harding/Tamestit review \u2013 vivid adventures and a fierce encounter with a tuba", "article": "Throughout October, the viola player Antoine Tamestit was the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s artist-in-focus. After performances of concertos by Walton and Martin\u016f, he closed his residency with the London premiere of the concerto written for him by J\u00f6rg Widmann. Tamestit gave the first performance in 2015, and he has since played it some 20 times, very often with Daniel Harding, who was conducting here too. Widmann\u2019s viola concerto is a substantial piece \u2013 a single movement lasting half an hour. It proceeds in picaresque fashion through a series of musical encounters between the soloist and members of the orchestra, during which he moves around the platform, confronting different instruments in turn. It\u2019s an idea that Thea Musgrave used more than half a century ago in her clarinet concerto, but Widmann was inspired by Tamestit himself, who has performed Berlioz\u2019s Harold in Italy with similar peregrinations.\nBut it begins with the soloist alone at the side of the stage, gently tapping on the body of his instrument, gradually drawing members of the orchestra into the argument. It\u2019s a while before Widmann allows Tamestit to reveal the gorgeous smoky sound that he can draw from his Stradivarius. The viola\u2019s subsequent adventures are undeniably vivid \u2013 there are brief flirtations with the harp and bass flute, a fierce encounter with the tuba, a violent outburst from the whole orchestra provoking frantic solo activity, before the wispy, quietly evaporating coda. But though they do make a fine showcase for Tamestit\u2019s outstanding virtuosity, they seem to be a series of self-contained, brilliantly conceived moments, rather than adding up to something more than the sum of their parts. After the concerto came two programmatic works by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k \u2013 the concert overture In Nature\u2019s Realm, and what is perhaps the best known of the five symphonic poems he composed in the mid 1890s, The Golden Spinning Wheel. Both were superbly played by the LSO, the brass particularly outstanding, and Harding\u2019s unfussy approach to the pictorial elements of the poem brought its gruesome narrative very convincingly to life. \u2022 Broadcast on Radio 3 on 4 November, and then available on BBC Sounds until 3 December.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/01/lso-harding-tamestit-review-barbican-london", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:14:09Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Law group threatens to sue over Immensa Covid testing scandal", "article": "The health secretary is facing legal action over the Immensa testing fiasco, in which about 43,000 people have been given false negative Covid results since September. The Good Law Project has sent a pre-action letter to Sajid Javid seeking answers over the scandal, which some experts believe has contributed to a rise in coronavirus cases in south-west England. The project, led by Jo Maugham QC, said it was asking the health secretary and UK Health Security Agency to terminate Immensa\u2019s contracts immediately, compensate the individuals affected and take action to properly regulate private testing firms. It says it will sue if its requests are not met, arguing there have been breaches of public law duties and the Human Rights Act. The letter says: \u201cThe false negatives and the defendants\u2019 unlawful failure to adequately monitor and regulate Immensa\u2019s performance have exposed the affected individuals, their families and communities to grave risks and in many cases harm.\u201d Downing Street has denied claims that the false Covid test results from the Wolverhampton lab were to blame for a sharp rise in cases in south-west England, saying the region may have been catching up with the rest of the country. Immensa was founded in May 2020 by Andrea Riposati, a former management consultant and owner of a DNA testing company. Three months later, the Department of Health awarded it a \u00a3119m PCR testing contract. Riposati is the firm\u2019s sole listed owner and board director. The award of the contract in autumn 2020 bypassed the normal competitive procedures, which the government said was necessary because of the urgency of the need for testing during the pandemic. Immensa was subsequently given a further \u00a350m testing contract in August 2021. The Guardian has learned that Immensa won a separate \u00a312m contract in relation to genomic sequencing as recently as September this year, raising questions over whether this would have happened if the problems regarding the Wolverhampton lab had been spotted sooner. Since the scandal broke it has emerged that Immensa was not fully accredited with the UK Accreditation Service. It was already the subject of an investigation into its sister company, Dante Labs, by the Competition and Markets Authority into its travel tests. Riposati is also the founder of Dante Labs. The Department of Health promised to look into behaviour at the Wolverhampton lab after a Sun on Sunday report about workers there allegedly fighting, sleeping, playing football and drinking on duty. The government said at the time it would speak to Immensa as it took \u201cevidence of misconduct extremely seriously\u201d. The Guardian also found that Dante Labs in the US had sent out used DNA test kits filled with other customers\u2019 saliva. After the incident in 2018, Dante Labs issued a statement saying five people received \u201cused kits\u201d as a result of an error by its shipping provider, with Riposati saying he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d. Maugham said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know why government chose to sidestep established testing facilities in universities and hospitals to send \u00a3119m to a newly formed private company. But the consequences have been catastrophic. Many people are likely to have lost their lives. We want answers for their families and the tens of thousands of others whose lives have been blighted by the government\u2019s inexplicable disregard for public health.\u201d A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThe Immensa laboratory in Wolverhampton passed an independent quality audit overseen by NHS Test and Trace and is in the process of UKAS accreditation.\u201d Separately, the Good Law Project has previously forced disclosures from the government about VIP access for favoured companies during the pandemic. Its legal proceedings also revealed that Lord Bethell, then a health minister, replaced his phone before it could be examined for information relevant to \u00a385m of deals that are subject to a legal challenge. Government lawyers said Bethell had not been issued with a \u201cpreservation notice\u201d requiring him to save documents because ministers\u2019 official correspondence was routinely saved as a matter of course. However, this did not cover government business conducted by private means. Bethell, who oversaw the award of Covid contracts and is no longer a minister, is one of those under scrutiny over the way deals for personal protective equipment (PPE) and tests were awarded at the height of the pandemic.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/law-group-threatens-to-sue-over-immensa-covid-testing-scandal", "last_update": "2021-11-01T14:19:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Global Covid-19 death toll passes 5m", "article": "The global death toll from Covid-19 has passed 5 million, 19 months after the pandemic was first declared, according to figures released by Johns Hopkins University. Some experts, including those from the World Health Organization, believe the true toll may be two to three times higher than official figures suggest. The number of deaths from Covid-19 far outstrip that of other viral epidemics in the 21st century and most from the 20th century, with the notable exception of the Spanish flu. The US, Brazil, India, Mexico and the UK together account for more than half of all deaths worldwide. In the last 28 days, Johns Hopkins University has logged 197,116 deaths and 11.7 million new cases around the world. After it was first recorded in China in late 2019, the coronavirus spread quickly to almost every corner of the world and the outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020. In the last month, the US, UK, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine have recorded the most new cases, while 581m doses of vaccine have been administered worldwide. The US has the largest death toll, at 745,836, followed by India (458,437). Russia\u2019s official death toll stands at 235,318, although independent analysis of excess deaths in Russia by the Moscow Times suggests the true figure could be up to three times higher. UK government figures show that in the last seven days there were 284,058 new cases, numbers last seen in the January and July peaks of the virus in the UK. In the last week 1,099 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total official death toll to 163,515. Nearly 80% of the population aged 12 and above in the UK have received two doses of a vaccine, and 86.9% have had at least one. Ariel Karlinsky, a member of the World Health Organization\u2019s technical advisory group on Covid mortality, said the 5 million milestone was actually passed \u201ca long time ago\u201d. He estimated the the true global death toll from the pandemic so far was \u201cat least 10 million people\u201d. \u201cThere are 5 million covid deaths just in India,\u201d he estimated in an interview with the Guardian. Karlinsky said the most reliable indicator was excess death toll, which was typically 40% higher, according to data. But he said certain countries were statistical \u201cblack holes\u201d. These included India, Pakistan and many countries in Africa. Belarus and Nicaragua had dramatically undercounted Covid-related deaths, while in Egypt excess mortality was 13 times higher than official figures, he said. There was a correlation between good governance and good data, he added. He said in Russia more than 872,000 people had died of Covid, according to his estimate on Monday, over three times the Kremlin\u2019s figure. \u201cAutocrats tend to manipulate data. In Moscow, it is much worse than reported. The numbers from Belarus are complete nonsense,\u201d Karlinsky said. Dr Albert Ko, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, said: \u201cThis is a defining moment in our lifetime. What do we have to do to protect ourselves so we don\u2019t get to another 5 million?\u201d The death toll as tallied by Johns Hopkins rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, Covid-19 is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke. Hotspots for the virus have shifted over the course of the pandemic, with eastern European countries experiencing a surge amid low vaccination rates, while some places such as Thailand reopen to tourism.\nDr Wafaa El-Sadr, the director of ICAP, a global health centre at Columbia University in the US, told the Associated Press: \u201cWhat\u2019s uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries. That\u2019s the irony of Covid-19.\u201d Wealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to Covid-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from Covid. The Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracking dashboard has become regarded as one of the most reliable measures of the spread of the disease globally, as it is independent and run by a small team of disease modelling experts at the University in Baltimore. The dashboard project began in January 2020, initially with manual data entry, and it is now automated and scrapes Covid data from official government sources around the world, with a team of about a dozen people managing it.

{"title": "Could landlocked south Texas help a backlogged US supply chain?", "article": "An unusual event marking what organizers called \u201cthe start of the produce season\u201d was recently held on the US side of an international port of entry connecting Mexico with Pharr, Texas. It was a different kind of ribbon-cutting ceremony, in front of a crowd of hundreds gathered beneath a large tent leading to the bridge connecting the United States and Mexico. Local dignitaries from both sides of the border were given a fruit or vegetable imported from Mexico and asked to cut it, which they dutifully did to the delight of the crowd. Then came the free-for-all. The crowd was given bags and told to take what they wanted from a carefully staged backdrop of every type of fruit and vegetable that comes through this region. While this quaint tradition has been a mainstay of the region for years, this year may make the event more significant, asthe United States struggles with supply chain problems in the wake of the pandemic.\nThat\u2019s because the produce-importing capacity of this landlocked port of entry could provide a solution that would help alleviate the problems that have been created by the backlog of ships waiting to offload cargo at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which account for 40% of all shipping containers entering the US. When President Biden recently announced that the Los Angeles port would stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to alleviate the backlog, a total of 64 ships were berthed at the two ports and an additional 80 were parked in the Pacific waiting their turn to unload. Experts are already predicting a Christmas shortage of certain goods, particularly those coming from Asia. What does Mexican produce coming through a landlocked south Texas port have to do with this backlog? It may be the key to developing a new trade route that avoids California and uses Mexican ports to get into the US via south Texas. It may even show the potential for a new mode of transportation that could alleviate growing traffic problems on our nation\u2019s highways. The key is the newly remodeled Mexican Federal Highway 40, or the Carretera Interoce\u00e1nica (Interoceanic Highway). This is a road that runs from near the Port of Mazatl\u00e1n on the Pacific coast to Reynosa, Mexico, just across the border from several cities in south Texas and is connected by several ports of entry, including the Pharr International Bridge. The 1,145 km route bisects the northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains by way of 63 tunnels and 115 bridges, including the Baluarte Bridge, the highest suspension bridge in the world. And the highway provides direct access from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent improvements to this roadway have dropped the drive time across Mexico to three hours from eight. Produce grown near the Pacific coast of Mexico had once been transported north for import into the United States through California. But the opening of the remodeled Mexican highway, particularly in the mountain region, gave growers a new option \u2013 a route through Texas. Pharr, in south Texas, now boasts that it is the busiest importer of Mexican produce in the United States and is a conduit for more than $33bn in trade with Mexico in 2020. This includes $21bn worth of imports and $11bn in exports. The Pharr bridge ranks number one for avocados, shipping nearly 50% and more than $1bn of that fruit. It\u2019s number one in pineapple imports; number two for berries; and number three for tomatoes. As the produce boon began a few years ago, local realtors began joking that homes in neighborhoods that had been popular with drug dealers were being sold to produce importers. This region already has a large presence of factories called maquiladoras, twin plants that allow manufacturers to set up a factory on the US side of the border, transport partially built products to twin plants on the Mexican side of the border where labor costs are lower, and send back finished products to the US side at lower tariff rates because of the manufacturing process here. Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from Pharr, McAllen and Mission, has more than 200 manufacturing plants representing 155 companies and employing 100,000 workers. So even the success of produce imports is dwarfed by product imports from these twin plants such as televisions and computer monitors, which represent the top import over the Pharr bridge at double the revenue wrought from avocados. Some local community leaders are beginning to wonder aloud if the success of the produce imports can be a model for other products. Can the flow of goods from Asia to California take a slightly southern route to the Port of Mazatl\u00e1n? From there, the products can be off-loaded and shipped across Mexico on Highway 40 for import into the United States in south Texas. Once across the international boundary, shippers have two options: they can move their products via highway on trucks that are beginning their US journey through the middle of the country by way of Texas rather than the far west coast of California. Larger shipments can be transported 30 minutes east from the international border to the Port of Brownsville or driven five hours to the Port of Houston. As supply chain issues continue to fester in the United States, new concerns are being raised about disruptions to food products. This brings a sense of urgency to discussions of new trade routes and raises the profile of import areas such as Pharr, which has a growing inventory of cold storage units to temporarily keep produce and other food. There are even mid-term and long-term possibilities that would make a new Asia-Mexico-Texas trade route more viable, especially as an alternative to the west coast port congestion \u2013 rail shipments supplementing truck shipments and an innovative technology that could make rail and truck traffic seamlessly integrate into a multi-modal planner\u2019s dream. The Freight Shuttle Xpress is being designed in conjunction with Texas A&M University\u2019s Transportation Institute. It integrates what it calls \u201celectric-powered transporters\u201d capable of holding truck and shipping containers from one location to another. And in the best tradition of Walt Disney, these transporters would travel via a monorail system that could be built into the medians of existing highways. The approach would save on acquisition costs, including potential years-long eminent domain court fights for new right-of-way. It would also alleviate growing traffic problems, particularly along Texas\u2019s main street, the Interstate 35 corridor that cuts through the state. A 2016 study said that 2.2bn tons of freight moved through Texas, a figure projected to go up to 3.8bn tons by the year 2040. The Freight Shuttle Xpress tried to raise investment funding several years ago to begin a project emanating from the Port of Houston, but did not raise enough money. But a route emanating from south Texas has the allure of attracting Mexican investment at a time when a backlog of goods due to the pandemic favors new ideas.

While he\u2019s away black-opping and she\u2019s meant to be kicking a drug habit under the supervision of a friend of his (Michael Madsen), she goes missing near the desert California town Salton Sea, and Hunter puts his skills to use in an effort to find out what happened. Turns out, wouldn\u2019t you know it, she got mixed up with some shady people through her skeevy boyfriend Bobby (Hudson Garland) who is the son of local big shot Nichols (Jake Weber), a man who is trying to go more legit by getting involved with the water industry instead of just running, say, strip bars \u2013 which is where Hunter first meets Bobby and his dad.

{"title": "Bookshops thrive as France moves to protect sellers from Amazon", "article": "At her independent bookshop in the small, rural town of Puy-en-Velay in southern France, Anne Helman had seen an influx of customers since the coronavirus pandemic who said they would rather buy books in person than online. \u201cI\u2019ve never sold as many copies of Albert Camus\u2019s The Plague,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren wanted fantasy books. Adults wanted novels and the classics, particularly stories about viruses and the apocalypse. There has been a newfound enthusiasm for buying locally and supporting independent bookshops; it\u2019s seen as the virtuous thing to do.\u201d The French government is seizing on this increased support for independent bookshops to pursue its war against the domination of big tech firms. In a blow to Amazon, new legislation in France is to set a minimum price for book deliveries, in order to stop what the government calls \u201cdistorted competition\u201d against independent bookshops from digital giants who deliver books for a charge of as little as \u20ac0.01. The French culture minister, Roselyne Bachelot, begged the nation during one lockdown: \u201cDo not buy books from online platforms!\u201d Now the French parliament is limiting the market advantages of net giants, which it hopes could set a precedent for other European countries seeking to protect small bookstores. The minimum delivery fee, which still has to be decided in negotiations with the state regulator, should come into force next year.\nPassing laws to protect books and the book trade is a rare point of political consensus in France, where debate has otherwise become increasingly tense in the run-up to next year\u2019s presidential race. Emmanuel Macron has declared reading \u201ca national priority\u201d, extending opening hours for libraries. The move to force net giants to charge the same for delivery as small bookshops is part of the French notion of \u201ccultural exceptionalism\u201d, which has long sought to shield books and independent booksellers from the ravages of free-market forces. In contrast to the UK\u2019s famous three-for-two deals on novels, the French state fixes the prices of books and readers pay the same for a new book whether they buy online, at a high-street giant or a small bookseller. The law allows for a maximum discount on books of only 5%. It has helped preserve France\u2019s 3,500 independent bookshops \u2013 more than three times the number in the UK \u2013 which account for 12,000 jobs. But while French law bans free book deliveries, Amazon and other big companies selling online have circumvented this by charging just a single centime for shipping a book. Independent bookshops, to keep their narrow margins, have to charge much higher post-office prices. \u201cLocal bookstores typically have to charge about \u20ac6 [\u00a35] or \u20ac7 for sending a book, so there was a considerable gap,\u201d said G\u00e9raldine Bannier, a centrist MP who presented the law in the lower house of parliament. \u201cThis is about defending the diversity of where people can buy their books. It is very important to us.\u201d More than 20% of the 435m books sold in France in 2019 were bought online. The fate of French independent bookstores during the pandemic has greatly influenced the new law. France had three nationwide lockdowns. During the first two, bookshops remained closed, despite protests from writers and publishers. But during the second lockdown, in November 2020, the government reimbursed delivery fees for small independent booksellers. It resulted in small shops maintaining 70% of their business. \u201cIt showed what a brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,\u201d said the rightwing senator Laure Darcos who drafted the law. In the final lockdown this spring, books were deemed essential items and bookshops stayed open, with historically high numbers of customers flocking to buy from them. Across France, independent bookshops saw a year-on-year fall in sales of only 3.3% in 2020 despite three months of closures. Amazon warned that new legislation fixing delivery prices would \u201cweigh on the purchasing power of consumers\u201d and affect readers in small towns and rural areas. French politicians argued that people who bought books online tended to live in big cities and urban areas, while independent bookshops were present in rural areas in France. Wilfrid S\u00e9jeau, the owner of the independent bookshop Le Cypr\u00e8s in Nevers, Burgundy, said he had posted about 70 books a day to customers during France\u2019s second lockdown last year, wrapping many as gifts. When his shop reopened, there was a marked rise in customers from the surrounding rural area. \u201cPeople realised certain things are precious,\u201d he said of the human link between a bookseller and customer. \u201cA person might buy a lot of books on Amazon but also enjoy browsing in small bookshops. People often save a book into their basket on Amazon as soon as they hear about it so they don\u2019t forget. Now they tell us: \u2018I\u2019m stopping that, I\u2019ll send you a list or reserve on your site instead.\u2019\u201d His trade is up and he has created two jobs since the pandemic in the two independent bookstores he runs on the same street, along with a stationery shop. Guillaume Husson of the French booksellers\u2019 union, the Syndicat de la Librairie Fran\u00e7aise, said the law was about preserving bookstores as a meeting place in town centres, but also protecting publishers. \u201cIndependent bookstores don\u2019t sell the same things as other sales points \u2013 they have more first-time novelists, more challenging publications \u2013 that has allowed hundreds of publishers and writers to exist.\u201d Vincent Chabault, a sociologist at the University of Paris, saw good sales during the pandemic for his book \u00c9loge du Magasin: Contre l\u2019Amazonisation (In Praise of Shops: Against Amazonisation). He said small independent bookshops, which remained fragile, had become \u201cthe symbol of resistance against online platforms and Amazon\u201d adding: \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned from the Covid crisis is that digital capitalism has progressed and there\u2019s a need to preserve places and moments where we can be together unconnected and offline.\u201d Back in the Puy-en-Velay bookshop Le Chat Perch\u00e9, Helman praised the legislation. She had feared for her shop\u2019s survival when Covid first hit, but June 2020 to June 2021 proved to be her most profitable period in 23 years. She worried that customers had become so used to quick delivery by online giants that it would be a challenge for them to adapt to a slower pace of ordering books from independents. \u201cPeople are used to ordering something online that pops through the letter box two days later. That\u2019s the one thing which will still be hard to compete with.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/bookshops-thrive-as-france-moves-to-protect-sellers-from-amazon", "last_update": "2021-11-01T14:30:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Streich stays grounded as he leads Freiburg into a new dimension | Andy Brassell", "article": "There was a nasty surprise for some supporters leaving Europa-Park Stadion after an uplifting afternoon. Those who parked on Hermann-Mitsch-Strasse found that theirs was one of dozens of cars towed by the local authorities as visitors get used to traffic restrictions at SC Freiburg\u2019s new home. A few teething problems in the new place, perhaps, are to be expected. On the pitch, everything is much smoother. A home victory over struggling Greuther F\u00fcrth would be seen as standard in most contexts. Here, as a first win in only the second game at the new pad where they\u2019re still peeling the sticky-back plastic off some of the seats, it meant so much more. \u201cWe are already a little bit in love,\u201d said midfielder Nicolas H\u00f6fler, who headed the second in Saturday\u2019s victory in front of a sell-out crowd of 31,500.\nLeaving Dreisamstadion had been hard \u2013 their iconic coach Christian Streich wept on the pitch as the squad greeted fans at the end of the last game there, the 3-0 win over Augsburg in late September. Maybe it will be even harder as winter bites, with the trip into -8c in the old chocolate box of a ground in the Black Forest a rite of passage for the hardiest Bundesliga away teams in past years. It will be missed. Now, the move delayed by the pandemic feels as if it has come to pass at just the right time, with supporters back in the stadiums (even with the new 2G regulations meaning spectators can only enter after full vaccination or with a certificate of recovery from Covid, the F\u00fcrth tickets were snapped up in double-quick time) combining with Freiburg\u2019s excellent start to the season to create a sense of happening. They begin Monday morning in third place in the Bundesliga, as its only unbeaten team (or indeed as Germany\u2019s only domestically unbeaten professional side) with comfortably the best defensive record in the division. The seven Freiburg have let in makes them the only team with a single figure in the concession column. Having equalled the club\u2019s longest ever top-flight unbeaten run of 10 they could set a new record next week \u2013 if they avoid defeat at Bayern Munich.\nIf any coach could keep the near-euphoria in check it\u2019s Streich, the Bundesliga\u2019s longest-serving coach, one of its most popular and without doubt its most down-to-earth. He\u2019ll celebrate a decade in charge of the first team a few days before the turn of the year but his association with the club goes back much further \u2013 he\u2019s been on the coaching staff in various guises since 1995 having previously played a season for the club in the late \u201880s. His click with Freiburg is as real as it gets. Yet what makes him so loved in the Bundesliga is that he is more than just a great coach. He often holds court on wider societal themes in his press conferences, and emphasises perspective and respect in a game that can often lose sight of both. \u201cPeople who care for disabled people are genuinely worthy of praise,\u201d he told Deutsche Welle in his first major TV interview, a few months after his appointment. He also told DW in that interview that he was \u201ctrying to remain seated more\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s one of the few things that hasn\u2019t worked for him in the past 10 years. A huge element of the Streich legend is his touchline demeanour, wired, passionate and feeling every kick, whilst understanding that football is just football, the most important of the least important things in life. Now, Streich takes that attitude and the essence of what Freiburg are into their new arena. It will take some getting used to. \u201cI need months and years,\u201d he admitted after the game. \u201cI was there for 25 years. It somehow turned into half of my life.\u201d He might need a map as well, having famously cycled from his home to Dreisamstadion every day.\nThis season, all the familiar pieces of Freiburg are there \u2013 the long-serving Christian G\u00fcnter at the back, Nils Pedersen\u2019s goals off the bench and Vincenzo Grifo\u2019s craft \u2013 but there are a few supplementary strands. Jeong Woo-Yeong, who didn\u2019t make it at Bayern but scored the club\u2019s first goal at Europa-Park a few weeks back, adds some imagination and Maxi Eggestein brings thrust in midfield having joined late in summer from Werder Bremen. So the fans in those packed stands on Saturday chanted \u201cZieht den Bayern die Lederhosen aus\u201d \u2013 Take Bayern\u2019s lederhosen off \u2013 with feeling. Freiburg have travelled to Munich in an encounter with meaning in recent memory, hoping a win on the season\u2019s final day in May 2017 could seal a return to European competition. They were made to wait to pursue their aim \u2013 the singer Anastasia\u2019s half-time concert went on long enough to delay the second half by nearly 10 minutes, as Arjen Robben helped carry bits of stage off the pitch so the match could resume. Freiburg eventually went down 4-1, reduced in every way to peripherals in Bayern\u2019s title party. This time, they return to Allianz-Arena through the front door \u2013 and they deserve to share the stage on equal footing, rather than just as the support act.\nTalking points \u2022 Bayern recovered from a rare and shocking hammering \u2013 5-0 at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach to exit the DfB Pokal in midweek \u2013 by rattling in five of their own at high-flying Union, ending the Berliners\u2019 unbeaten home record. There were still signs of vulnerability as Union came back strongly after half-time \u2013 Kingsley Coman\u2019s lightening strike to make it 4-1 suddenly killed off that comeback \u2013 but Bayern will have coach Julian Nagelsmann back from quarantine for Benfica\u2019s Champions League visit this week. \u2022 Borussia Dortmund had their moments of fortune too, despite beating K\u00f6ln 2-0, with prolific B team striker Steffen Tigges scoring a debut first-team goal and helping make light of Erling Haaland\u2019s continued absence. The much-improved visitors were excellent, with Gregor Kobel saving BVB more than once. \u201cExcept for the result, I\u2019m happy with a lot of things,\u201d said their coach Steffen Baumgart, who opposite number Marco Rose added: \u201cYou have to say that Effzeh were the better team.\u201d \u2022 Wolfsburg began the post-Mark van Bommel era in fine style, deservedly winning Florian Kohfeldt\u2019s first game in charge 2-0 at Leverkusen, with Lukas Nmecha and Maximilian Arnold getting the goals. There was always the question at Werder Bremen as to how the imaginative Kohfeldt might have got on with a better set of players \u2013 we might be about to find out. Meanwhile, Die W\u00f6lfe have perhaps passed the crisis baton to Leverkusen, whose confidence has clearly been shaken by their thrashing from Bayern, and have now lost three in a row at home following this and the midweek Pokal exit to Karlsruhe. \u2022 Augsburg netted their 50th Bundesliga win under Markus Weinzierl, coming back from a shaky start to beat Stuttgart 4-1 in some style. There was also a first goal since February 2020 for Alfred Finnbogason, who has struggled with Achilles tendon issues. \u201cI have to lie down in the bathtub for the next few days,\u201d he remarked afterwards.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/01/streich-stays-grounded-as-he-leads-freiburg-into-a-new-dimension", "last_update": "2021-11-01T13:28:47Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Conservative party readmits MP who sexually harassed staff member", "article": "An MP has been readmitted to the Conservative party, despite having been found to have sexually harassed a member of staff. Rob Roberts had his party membership suspended for 12 weeks and was also banned from the House of Commons for six weeks, after an independent panel found he made repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards someone who worked in his office and used \u201chis position as his employer to place him under pressure to accede\u201d. On Monday, Roberts regained his party membership, but still has the whip withdrawn, meaning he sits as an independent in parliament. However, the MP for Delyn in north Wales still sits on the government\u2019s side of the Commons green benches, and votes in line with the Conservative whip. A Conservative party spokesperson confirmed Roberts\u2019 readmission and that the whip remained withdrawn. Although Roberts served his suspension from parliament, he avoided being subject to a recall petition. This is usually automatically triggered when an MP is suspended for more than 10 days. However, because Roberts appealed against the initial verdict by the standards commissioner, it emerged that his punishment was not covered by the existing recall legislation because the case was then judged by a separate body known as an \u201cindependent expert panel\u201d. The failure of Conservative headquarters \u201cto stop Roberts\u2019 readmission means that the withdrawal of his whip is in name only\u201d, a senior Tory staffer told the Guardian. They added: \u201cThis sends a worrying signal to parliamentary staff members who are still dealing with predatory and abusive behaviour on a daily basis.\u201d The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said his readmission to the Tories was scandalous, and criticised the government for voting down a motion to change the law so the punishment of a recall petition could be applied retrospectively. \u201cRob Roberts should have resigned as an MP the moment he was suspended from parliament for sexual misconduct,\u201d Dodds said. That he had now returned to the Conservative party showed it had let him off the hook, she added. \u201cJust last week, the government voted against allowing Roberts\u2019 constituents to choose whether he is the right person to represent them, and now they are choosing to readmit him as a member of their party. Yet again, the Conservative party is acting like there\u2019s one rule for their MPs and another rule for everyone else.\u201d The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called on Roberts to do the \u201chonourable\u201d thing and step down as an MP, but argued that retrospective punishment would go against the principle that there should be no imposition of a sanction \u201cwhich was not available at the time when a given case was determined\u201d. The investigators\u2019 report into Roberts said that he had accepted that \u201caspects of his behaviour\u201d towards a staff member were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and had offered to apologise but that he \u201crejected the categorisation of his conduct as \u2018sexual\u2019, preferring the term \u2018romantic\u2019\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/conservative-party-readmits-mp-sexually-harassed-staff-rob-roberts", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:55:16Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "What is deforestation \u2013 and is stopping it really possible?", "article": "Forests and nature are centre stage at Cop26. On the second day of the Glasgow summit, world leaders are announcing a commitment to halting and reversing deforestation. As the second largest source of greenhouse gases after energy, the land sector accounts for 25% of global emissions, with deforestation and forest degradation contributing to half of this. But why do forests matter to the climate, and how can we halt deforestation? What is a forest? There are an estimated three trillion trees on Earth. Some form part of enormous forest ecosystems like the Congo rainforest, while others stand in sparsely populated landscapes such as on the edges of the Sahara desert. Of the 60,000 known tree species, nearly a third are threatened with extinction, according to a recent assessment. Scientists cannot decide on a single definition of a forest due to disagreements over tree density, height and canopy cover. But the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s version is commonly used: \u201cLand with a tree canopy cover of more than 10% and area of more than 0.5 hectares.\u201d Forest covered almost a third of the world\u2019s landmass in 2020, with more than half found in just five countries: Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China. The taiga \u2013 also known as northern boreal forest \u2013 is the world\u2019s largest, stretching around the northern hemisphere through Siberia, Canada and Scandinavia. Temperate, tropical and boreal are the three main types of forest that include a great diversity of ecosystems: cloud forest, rainforest, mangrove swamps, and tropical dry forest, among many others.\nWhy do forests matter for the climate? Forests are among the most biodiverse places on the planet and form an enormous carbon store, regulating the world\u2019s weather and climate. They hold about 861 gigatons of carbon \u2013 equivalent to nearly a century\u2019s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate \u2013 and absorbed twice as much carbon as they emitted in the last two decades. More carbon is stored in soil (44%) than living biomass (42%), with the rest found in dead wood (8%) and forest litter (5%). Forests like the Congo basin rainforest \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest \u2013 affect rainfall thousands of miles away around the Nile. Billions of humans rely on forests for food, building materials and shelter.\nBut they are being cleared at a relentless pace. About 10% of tree cover has been lost since 2000, according to Global Forest Watch. Although estimates vary, the land sector is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for around a quarter of emissions, according to the IPCC, of which deforestation is a major component. Many scientists say it will not be possible to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels without halting deforestation. \u201cThere are two main points on forests and carbon,\u201d says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford. \u201cForests are a carbon store, meaning that when you deforest, you\u2019re releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. The other thing is that intact forests have been shown to be a carbon sink, absorbing carbon over time. And if our sink is disappearing, you\u2019re losing the service that the biosphere provides \u2013 an assumption that such a sink will continue is built into almost all of our climate model scenarios for this century.\u201d Do all forests store the same amount of carbon? No. Old-growth forests that are free from human industrial interference and pollution are especially important for the climate and biodiversity. They are called primary forests and are ancient, carbon-dense ecosystems bursting with life such as parts of the Amazon, the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest in Poland and Papua New Guinea. With some of the largest trees and the biggest variety of life, conservationists place extra emphasis on their protection from logging, wildfires and human industry as they only account for one-third of the planet\u2019s forest cover. Young or recovering forests store much less carbon and can sometimes take several years before they become effective sinks.\nTropical rainforests, mangrove and peat swamp forests \u2013 such as those found in south-east Asia \u2013 play a disproportionally important role in regulating the climate due to the amount of carbon they store, their cooling effect and the protection they provide from flooding. Boreal forests, which are covered in snow for large parts of the year, reflect more heat back into the atmosphere and have a net warming effect on the climate. Agricultural tree plantations with very few species are much less carbon-dense and support much less life. What is deforestation? Deforestation is the human-driven conversion to another land use of a forest, such as cattle ranching or soya bean production, that is often clearcut with machinery then burnt. It is not the same as logging: trees can be selectively taken out of a standing forest. Deforestation has gone hand in hand with human development for centuries. Nearly all the temperate rainforest that once covered large parts of the British Isles was cleared for agriculture, roads and human settlements, for example. As well as being a major source of carbon emissions, land use change is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, which scientists warn is driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. From space, deforestation often follows a \u201cfishbone pattern\u201d where land is cleared along the edges of roads and rivers. Over time, the fishbone fills in as more of the forest is cleared. On a large scale, the process can become self-perpetuating, such as the Amazon switching from rainforest to savannah, as so much of it has been destroyed.\nLast year, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bolivia, Indonesia and Peru were the top five countries for tropical primary forest loss. About 12m hectares (30m acres) of tree cover was lost in the tropics. This includes 4.2m hectares of primary forests, an area the size of the Netherlands, releasing the equivalent to the annual emissions of 570m cars. Why do people clear forests? While there are many local factors, experts say the main reason is financial: forests are worth more dead than alive in monetary terms. In Brazil, large parts of the Amazon have been cleared for beef production. In Indonesia, forests and peatlands have been cleared and drained for oil palm plantations. In other areas, coffee, cocoa, bananas, pineapples, coca leaves and subsistence farming have driven land-clearing. Most deforestation hotspots are in tropical regions, which are also profitable areas for farming. \u201cThe largest factor is the expansion of agricultural industries: cattle ranching, soya bean farming and oil palm,\u201d says Malhi. \u201cA second factor is poverty. In many parts of Africa, such as Madagascar, where there is demographic pressure, a lot of poor, rural settlers are just looking to make a living on the frontier as populations increase. The same is true in parts of South America and south-east Asia.\u201d Can we really stop deforestation? It will not be easy, but there are reasons to be hopeful. Alongside the commitment from world leaders in Glasgow at Cop26, it is hoped big producers and consumers of commodities linked to deforestation will sign up to eradicating them from the global supply chain. China \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest consumers \u2013 is taking deforestation more seriously and is looking at \u201cgreening\u201d its supply chain.\n\u201cWe really need to start thinking about forest loss \u2013 especially tropical forest loss \u2013 in the same way people are now talking about coal,\u201d says Frances Seymour, a forest and governance expert at the World Resources Institute (WRI). \u201cThere was a big celebration that China had committed to no longer financing new coal abroad. But we need to be looking for similar commitments from all countries to stop financing projects that lead to deforestation abroad.\u201d Are there any examples we can learn from? Costa Rica is the only tropical country to successfully halt and reverse deforestation. It did so, in part, with payments from an ecosystem services programme that put an economic value on standing forests and biodiversity. The country won the first Earthshot prize this year for the scheme, reversing one of the highest deforestation rates in Latin America in the 70s and regrowing large areas of forest. On a larger scale, Brazil had considerable success at reducing deforestation in the Amazon in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Environmental laws, improved surveillance of slash-and-burn illegal logging and a soya moratorium in the Amazon were credited with the fall. However, there have since been large spikes in deforestation in the world\u2019s largest rainforest under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. Indonesia has had success in recent years slowing deforestation with a palm oil expansion moratorium, although experts warn it is fragile for the same reasons: the economic incentives to clear forest have not changed. A UN scheme that provides financial incentives to protect forests \u2013 known as Redd+ \u2013 has been agreed by countries. It allows developing countries to sell carbon credits to preserve carbon sinks. Although there is still division over the rules for carbon markets, it is hoped these will be sorted at Cop26. Countries like Gabon, with low deforestation rates and large forest cover, say that they also need funding to protect forests. Gabon is the chair of the African group of negotiators for Cop26. Why are indigenous communities so important for stopping deforestation? Studies show indigenous communities are the best protectors of forests. Many landscapes thought to be wilderness have actually been managed by indigenous communities for centuries. This year, a UN review of more than 250 studies found that in Latin America, deforestation rates were lower in their territories than elsewhere. Despite this, many indigenous and tribal peoples face persecution, racism and violence. In July, a two-year trial using remote sensors to alert indigenous communities in Peru to early deforestation found a decrease in tree loss of 37% overall for both years, compared to the control group. Researchers say that if this was scaled up, it could have a big effect on reducing deforestation.\nJessica Webb, senior manager for global engagement at Global Forest Watch, says: \u201cA third of the Amazon rainforest falls within approximately 3,300 formally acknowledged territories of indigenous peoples. Based on modelling we did with our partner Rainforest Foundation US, as a result of this study, we predict that an additional 123,000 hectares a year of deforestation could be prevented by scaling this approach to other communities within the Amazon. It would be the equivalent of taking 21m cars off the road for a year.\u201d\nCan satellites protect forests? Ecosystem monitoring is experiencing a technological revolution. Deforestation is easier to track through a dataset developed by researchers at the University of Maryland, Nasa and Google. As image resolutions improve, we are close to being able to monitor deforestation in real time. But \u201cthere are still gaps on being able to monitor restoration and degradation\u201d, says Crystal Davis, director at the Land & Carbon Lab, a WRI initiative that aims to provide information on how the world can meet climate and biodiversity commitments and the needs of 10 billion humans. \u201cWe also need a better understanding of the accuracy of global datasets. They are not consistent across geography,\u201d she says. What about reforestation? The world needs to restore forests to meet climate and biodiversity goals. But scientists say halting deforestation is an urgent task as it emits carbon immediately whereas it takes decades for nature to recover and sequester carbon. Primary forests that have stood for thousands of years cannot be replaced by tree-planting schemes. What if we don\u2019t stop deforestation? Cutting emissions from fossil fuels is the most urgent task to avoid more global heating. But if the world continues to lose forests, we risk triggering tipping points with unintended consequences. The Amazon could turn into savannah, boreal forests could die back and carbon stores that took thousands of years to sequester could be released. What this would mean for food security, weather systems and millions of other species is unlikely to be good news, experts warn. Robert Nasi, head of the Center for International Forestry Research, says: \u201cWe would have climatic change that is cascading: the drying of the Amazon, the Congo Basin \u2026 there is a lot of risk of a domino effect. If we don\u2019t protect the forests, people will migrate, there will be climate refugees.\u201d With thanks to: Crystal Davis, director at the Land & Carbon Lab Frances Seymour, distinguished senior fellow, World Resources Institute Luiz Amaral, director, global solutions for commodities and finance, World Resources Institute Robert Nasi, director general at the Center for International Forestry Research Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford Jessica Webb, senior manager for global engagement at Global Forest Watch This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-what-is-deforestation-and-is-stopping-it-really-possible-aoe", "last_update": "2021-11-02T01:12:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Cyclist Alex Dowsett: \u2018If I stick to my lap times I\u2019ll break the hour record\u2019 | Donald McRae", "article": "\u201cThat\u2019s the closest to death I\u2019ll ever be without actually dying,\u201d the Australian cyclist Jack Bobridge said in January 2015 after he had failed to break the hour record. He had ridden 51.3km around a track in 60 minutes but he was still half a kilometre short of the world record. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe how much pain my gluts and quads are in, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Years before, in October 1972, Eddy Merckx, one of the greatest cyclists to have lived, set a record for the hour in Mexico when he rode 49.43km. He could not speak when, his face etched in suffering, he was helped off his bike. Merckx said later: \u201cNever before had I had such pain. It was the hardest ride I\u2019ve ever done and I never felt such pain again.\u201d On Wednesday, at the velodrome in Aguascalientes, Mexico, Alex Dowsett will attempt to reclaim the hour record he held briefly in 2015 before Bradley Wiggins broke it 36 days later. Dowsett will try to ride more than the 55.089km Victor Campenaerts covered at the same track when setting a world mark in April 2019.\nThe hour is regarded as one of the most brutal challenges in sport but Dowsett is refreshingly laconic. He is still sorting out the logistics of his latest crack at the record and points out wryly that organising the ride might be harder than the physical pain: \u201cMy coach, Michael Hutchinson, said it\u2019s like organising a world championships and then going out and competing in it.\u201d Dowsett has a remarkable personal story and is proud to spend as much time in our 80 minutes together talking about the fact that haemophilia has not prevented him from carving out a successful career in the unforgiving world of professional cycling. He is determined his new tilt at the hour record will give fresh momentum to the Little Bleeders charity he started in 2016. The aim is to encourage the 3,000 young people who were born with the rare condition in Britain to understand that haemophilia should not limit their ambitions. Before we chart his own past as a little bleeder, and his hopes of raising awareness of a condition that hits men far more than women, with one in 10,000 males in the UK affected by haemophilia, I ask Dowsett if he expects to endure as gruelling an ordeal as Merckx did. \u201cNot at all. I hate saying this because it\u2019s the great Eddy Merckx but he didn\u2019t do the hour record that efficiently. \u201cHe broke the 10km and 20km marks because he went out of the blocks like a greyhound and hung on. That\u2019s the worst way to do an hour record and not something I\u2019d ever want to experience.\n\u201cThe only other person to do that was Jack Bobridge and he became a verb in the Movistar camp [the cycling team for whom Dowsett rode] back in 2015 when I did the record. We all said: \u2018We don\u2019t want to do a Bobridge.\u2019 So for me the first 30 minutes will be very controlled and disciplined and then the second 30 is where you start working out what you can do. \u201cFor lots of people it\u2019s the biggest thing they\u2019ll ever do so there are tales of Eddie Merckx and all those horror stories. But it is only an hour. It\u2019s not a six-hour slog in the mountains of a Grand Tour when you\u2019re 18 days deep into one. It can be broken down and, all things being equal, you should get the first 20 minutes for free. After that it will be looking at 10-lap blocks or five-minute chunks. \u201cMike Hutchinson will be on the side of the track giving me pacing feedback every lap. So I know if I stick to certain lap times I will break the record. The challenge will be at the back end of the hour to start adjusting or maintaining the pace.\u201d\nDid he maintain such concentration throughout his successful ride in Manchester in 2015? \u201cI wasn\u2019t on my absolute limit so I could listen to the commentator. I saw where my mates were round the track whereas this one will be much tougher. I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019ll be mentally.\u201d Dowsett regards his 2015 world record with some regret. \u201cIt was actually a very enjoyable experience because I knew after 40 minutes I was going to break the record. We had about 3,000 people [in the velodrome] and it was unforgettable. But afterwards, looking at the numbers, we knew we\u2019d been too safe. \u201cIt\u2019s haunted me because I could have given Wiggins quite a task. I got the record and everyone was happy \u2013 but there was a slight hollow feeling. I could have done much more and, after months of work, I probably used only 80% of what I\u2019m capable of. It should have been around the 54km mark. Wiggins rode 54.457km. \u201cIt was going to be his great swansong and we were expecting 55 or 56km. But had he done 56km then Victor and I might not have attempted it.\u201d He was meant to race in the hour this time last year, again in Manchester, but he contracted Covid. Dowsett was disappointed because, having won a stage of the Giro d\u2019Italia last October, \u201cI had been feeling really fantastic and, in Manchester, the only variable is air pressure. On the day we were meant to make the attempt it was perfect \u2013 but these things happen.\u201d\nThe marked difference between this attempt and his two previous campaigns is that Dowsett and his partner, Chanel, have done the overwhelming bulk of organising the event in Mexico \u2013 even though they are new parents to their daughter, Juliette. \u201cIt\u2019s been far more arduous for Chanel,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is really organising it but you can\u2019t help but be involved in the trials and tribulations. The list of requirements needed to ride a bike round a velodrome for an hour is vast. But through sheer hard work it has come together.\u201d Dowsett has been galvanised by his desire to use the hour record to publicise how haemophilia should not be a barrier to anyone. \u201cMy parents did a wonderful job shielding me from the negatives around haemophilia when I was young. Every so often we look back, whether it\u2019s the finish line of the Tour de France or the hour record or any of the unimaginable things I\u2019ve achieved. \u201cIf we\u2019d had a crystal ball back then and known everything was going to be better than all right I\u2019m not sure my parents would have believed it.\u201d They initially struggled to get a diagnosis. \u201cBeing a dad now I appreciate what they went through and my mum says I owe her a facelift. I was a happy, healthy baby but mum and dad would notice how easily I bruised. They\u2019d pick me up and when they put me down I\u2019d have two black bruised thumb prints across my rib cage. Mum knew something wasn\u2019t right and took me to the doctors numerous times \u2013 but they kept sending her away and saying: \u2018He\u2019s just a baby that bruises easily.\u2019 \u201cWhen I was 18 months old Mum demanded I had a blood test. She remembers the doctor threw the documents across the table because the idea of putting an 18-month-old through a blood test was, to him, worse than anything. On the way out of the blood test I fell over and split the skin between my lip and gum. \u201cThere are 13 steps to the blood clotting and, as a haemophiliac, I don\u2019t have the eighth one. A cut will look like it\u2019s healing until that eighth stage and then everything breaks down.\n\u201cMum and Dad put me to bed that night thinking all was well and the little cut was healing up. They checked on me at two in the morning and I was asleep in a pool of my own blood. So they rang the doctor because they thought I had leukaemia. A different doctor said: \u2018I think your son\u2019s got haemophilia.\u2019 Then the blood test results came back and I had severe haemophilia A. The original doctor apologised and said: \u2018I need to research haemophilia more and trust a mother\u2019s intuition.\u2019\u201d There were many difficult days and, because there was a blood transfusion link then between haemophilia and HIV, Alex did not often get invited to birthday parties as a schoolboy. He also sometimes turned up at school on crutches or with his arm in a sling. It was only when the right medication became available, and he was advised to be as fit as possible, that life became easier. He swam a lot and then everything changed when, with his dad, he discovered cycling.\nDowsett believes people are more informed about the condition but is he surprised that haemophiliac elite athletes are so rare? \u201cWhen I was young the treatment had just been introduced. The treatment I\u2019m on now stops me having a bleeding episode whereas when I was younger the treatment was to fix the bleeding, so it was reactive. Now medication is proactive. So I\u2019m the first in a generation that can achieve elite-sport level because if I\u2019d been born a decade earlier it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to sustain any kind of training. We are very lucky it\u2019s life-changing medication.\u201d He has lived the life of an ordinary professional cyclist for 11 years \u2013 which has brought him two Giro stage wins, a European under-23 title and multiple national time-trial championships as well as the uncertainty of racing for teams that go out of business. Dowsett moved from the disbanded Katusha to the new Israel Start-Up Nation in 2020 and there was great anxiety last year. He was unsure whether his contract would be extended before he won a hard Giro stage after a solo breakaway. Dowsett cried with relief and, as he says now: \u201cIt was tough because Juliette was on the way and I thought my cycling career was ending.\n\u201cIt was also frightening as cycling was the only income Chanel and I had. Winning that stage bought me another two years and sharpened my focus on the hour record. Each year since 2015 I\u2019d asked whichever team I was on: \u2018Can we do the hour?\u2019 Each time there was noncommittal pushback and so Chanel and I said: \u2018We\u2019re doing it ourselves.\u2019\u201d Now they\u2019re so close how is Dowsett feeling? \u201cHutch said: \u2018There are two ways of dealing with it, Alex. You can try and escape the stress or just embrace it.\u2019 So Chanel and I keep thinking: \u2018No matter how hard it is, we are glad we\u2019re doing this.\u2019 It\u2019s a hell of an experience. \u201cVictor Campenaerts has given me a 50-50 chance of breaking it and I\u2019m not scared to fail. It would have been easy to not do this attempt, especially with the organisation, but failing is a far better alternative to not trying. There\u2019s something quite poignant there for the haemophilia community.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/cyclist-alex-dowsett-hour-record-attempt-haemophilia", "last_update": "2021-11-01T15:19:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Climate optimism is an illusion, UN chief tells Cop26", "article": "Optimistic assessments of progress on tackling the climate crisis were \u201can illusion\u201d, the UN secretary general has said in a scathing critique of world leaders\u2019 efforts so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stave off climate breakdown. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, greeting leaders gathering for the Cop26 summit, roundly dismissed the suggestion that the climate situation was improving, and he exhorted the more than 120 heads of government to \u201cchoose to safeguard our future and save humanity\u201d instead of continuing with the addiction to fossil fuels. \u201cRecent climate action announcements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around. This is an illusion,\u201d he told the conference in Glasgow.\nG20 leaders met at the weekend without making fresh commitments to further cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, though they did agree on the importance of taking action this decade. Scientists say emissions must be cut by about 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels, to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold of safety. The UK, as host of Cop26, has set as its aim to \u201ckeep 1.5C alive\u201d. Two days of talks among world leaders will be followed by nearly a fortnight of tense negotiations by officials with the aim of producing a global deal to get on track for the emissions cuts necessary. But Guterres said nations were still far off track on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions as the conference opened. Without further commitments, he said, countries could be forced to return to the negotiating table not every five years, as set out in the Paris agreement, but every year. That threat will unsettle some countries at the talks that have been slow to come forward with strong commitments on cutting emissions and want to stick to the letter of the Paris agreement and only update commitments on a five-year schedule. Small developing countries, those with the most at stake in the climate crisis, want a more frequent schedule. Guterres said humanity stood on the brink of disaster and had been driven there by an addiction to fossil fuels and its \u201cbrutal\u201d treatment of the natural world. Further global heating \u2013 with temperature rises already at 1.1C \u2013 would risk pushing the world past the point of no return.\n\u201cWe face a moment of truth. We are fast approaching tipping points that will trigger escalating feedback loops of global heating,\u201d he said. Scientists have said surpassing 1.5C would risk some of the consequences of climate change, including ice sheet melting, rapidly becoming irreversible. Guterres gave a stark depiction of human ruin, with the planet changing before our eyes in the form of melting glaciers, disappearing forests and polluted oceans, the result of \u201ctreating nature like a toilet\u201d. He said: \u201cWe face a stark choice: either we stop [the addiction] or it stops us. It\u2019s time to say: enough. Enough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon.\u201d In an echo of the film Trainspotting, which was set in nearby Edinburgh, he called on leaders to shake off the addiction and choose a better path. \u201cChoose ambition. Choose solidarity. Choose to safeguard our future and save humanity,\u201d he said. Finance to help poor countries was also a crucial issue, Guterres said. A promise to developing countries of $100bn (\u00a373bn) a year in climate finance by 2020 has not been met. Guterres said recent findings that it would be met from 2023 would \u201cdelay the largest support for years, with no clear guarantees\u201d.\nThe UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, also spoke at the opening ceremony, and began his speech with a James Bond analogy. Bond often ends up in peril, said Johnson, \u201cstrapped to a doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it. \u201cAnd we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today, except that the tragedy is that this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.\u201d He also spoke of rich countries\u2019 responsibility to pull their weight: \u201cWe in the developed world must recognise the special responsibility to help everybody else to do it, because it was here in Glasgow 250 years ago that James Watt came up with a machine that was powered by steam that was produced by burning coal.\u201d \u201cYes my friends, we have brought you to the very place where the doomsday device began to tick.\u201d The prime minister also urged representatives to consider their responsibility to future generations: \u201cThe people who will judge us are children not yet born, and their children, and we are now coming centre stage before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity and we must not fluff our lines or miss our cue. \u201cBecause if we fail they will not forgive us. They will know that Glasgow was the historic turning point when history failed to turn. They will judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today, and they will be right.

{"title": "No greenwash and no fudges: Cop26\u2019s success depends on leaders telling the truth | Ed Miliband", "article": "The defining choice facing leaders in Glasgow this week at Cop26 is whether to sugar-coat reality or be honest about the climate emergency, and demand the action that will be necessary to confront it. If we are to have any chance of preventing catastrophe, we must choose truth and candour. The most important truth is the maths. For all the millions of words spilled about this summit, not enough has been done to spell out its central task. Many leaders say we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, but few say out loud what that means. We know from the UN\u2019s figures that after the Paris accord of 2015, the world was heading for something like 53 billion tonnes of emissions in 2030. To keep global heating in line with 1.5C degrees, we need to cut emissions to 25 billion tonnes by then. There is an emissions gap of 28bn tonnes to be cut in this decisive decade. These numbers should be in the minds of everyone who cares about our planet\u2019s future.\nThe world has taken important strides forward in recent years. But the unfortunate reality is that the pledges made in advance of Cop26 amount to a cut of just 4bn tonnes. This leaves an aching emissions gap within which climate catastrophe would occur \u2013 putting us on track to a devastating 2.7C. This maths matters more than anything, and should shape our response to what countries announce at Glasgow. According to the respected Climate Action Tracker, no G20 country is doing enough. It will be in the interests of leaders and ministers at Cop26 to pretend more progress has been made than is the reality. Since we cannot negotiate with the science, we must force them \u2013 particularly those who have arrived in Glasgow only to reheat old commitments \u2013 to confront the truth and negotiate with each other. This summit cannot be a fortnight\u2019s fiesta of pre-packaged announcements; it must amount to a real reckoning to deliver the progress we need. As part of this, leaders must deliver justice for those in poorer countries who are least responsible for, and most vulnerable to, climate breakdown. It\u2019s time to make good on the promises stacked up, but not delivered \u2013 in particular the long overdue $100bn of finance that was promised for developing countries back in 2009, and the prime minister\u2019s pledge at the G7 in June to \u201cvaccinate the world\u201d against Covid. It\u2019s essential that we also recognise the loss and damage many poorer and developing countries face from climate breakdown. This is the way to help reassemble the coalition we saw in Paris between the most vulnerable developing countries and ambitious developed countries, to maximise pressure on the world\u2019s biggest emitters, including China. We must also head off the attempt to shift the scientific goalposts at Glasgow, which has crept into the UK government\u2019s benchmark of success for these talks. It is positive that countries representing 80% of global GDP are now covered by a net zero target for the middle of the century, but targets three decades in the future do not make up for a failure to act now. No country can be allowed to think that setting long-term targets gives them an alibi to not act in the short term. Take Australia, for example, whose 2050 net zero target, announced last week, is accompanied by a 2030 target which puts us on track for a 4C world. Or Saudi Arabia, which is mulling a 2060 target, while planning to increase its oil production over this decade. We cannot stand for such global greenwashing at this summit from our country or anyone else\u2019s.\nTelling these truths is not without its risks. Some people will worry that any admission of falling short in Glasgow will give the world and private investors reason to give up on their climate ambitions. Many of us remember the long shadow that was cast after the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, when the summit crash landed without comprehensive agreement. We cannot afford the same hangover, whatever the result in Glasgow. The world has come too far for that to happen. But that cannot be reason to pretend progress is fast enough if the reality is otherwise. That\u2019s because the inescapable truth is that, with the climate crisis, unlike so many other issues, winning slowly is not really winning. In this existential race against time, winning slowly means billions of people facing extreme heatwaves, countless millions more people displaced, and the destruction of natural wonders like our coral reefs. It also means forfeiting the opportunities that climate action offers, such as lifting people out of poverty by creating millions of good, green jobs. The truth matters both for the outcomes of Cop26 but also for what happens afterwards. The world is not due to return to the issue of country-by-country pledges until the next Cop26 happens in 2025. If we follow this course, we will forfeit 1.5C. We will need to come back much sooner to close the gap we face if we are to create a path out of Glasgow compatible with 1.5 degrees. We are all desperate for success over the next fortnight. But as we approach this crucial summit, those of us who are not in government have one power those in office will find it hard to fully embrace: the power to tell the truth about our progress in this decisive decade, however uncomfortable that may be. Playing our part in getting the right outcome means using this power without hesitation in the next two vital weeks. \u2022 Ed Miliband is the shadow secretary for business, energy and industry", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/01/greenwash-fudges-cop26-success-leaders-facing-reality", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:34:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},

A survey by Autonomy , a thinktank specialising in the future of work, concluded that improving working conditions was vital for sectors suffering from acute labour shortages. In the wake of a report suggesting almost one in four workers were considering quitting their jobs in the next few months, the Autonomy poll of more than 1,000 workers in the care, transport and logistics, and hospitality industries showed: 41% were considering leaving their job in the next 12 months. Low pay, long working hours and poor mental health were often cited as reasons for dissatisfaction. The majority of those considering quitting had been offered no incentives to stay by their employers. Workers in these sectors reported that a pay rise, shorter working hours for the same pay and better in-work benefits such as holiday pay and pensions would stop them from resigning. UK job vacancies are at a record high, reaching 1.1m in the latest data reported by the Office for National Statistics, and Autonomy said shortages of labour had had a severe impact on business, leading to a loss of clients and income through an inability to deliver services and products. Will Stronge, the thinktank\u2019s director of research, said: \u201cThe good news is that the labour market crisis can be solved fairly easily by offering better working conditions. \u201cHowever, the response by companies is falling far short of what is needed and unless they quickly come up with a better offer, our research suggests the crisis is going to get a lot worse in the next 12 months. \u201cThe Covid pandemic has shone a spotlight on unfair and precarious working practices in Britain and it seems that workers have simply had enough.\u201d\nThe Autonomy survey also contained new analysis from the shareholder advisory firm PIRC that showed three-quarters of the largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 with a collective global workforce of 4.5 million \u2013 cited labour shortages or staff retention as principal risks to their business. Tom Powdrill, the head of stewardship at PIRC, said: \u201cThe labour market is at a crucial juncture that requires urgent action. \u201cPrivate sector companies have a duty to themselves, their investors and their workforces to take steps in order to avoid further problems and costs down the line.

{"title": "Giovanni Simeone writes own story as Verona leave Juventus on the canvas | Nicky Bandini", "article": "Giovanni Simeone gets tired of every conversation coming back to his father. All through his development as a youth player, he had to put up with the suspicions of strangers. People who might have never seen him play, yet chose to believe he was having certain opportunities because his dad, Diego, had been a superstar player and was on the path to becoming one as a manager. Even now, 26 years old and enjoying his sixth season as a starter in Serie A, Giovanni knows every success will come with a predictable line of questioning. After scoring twice to bury Juventus on Saturday, he was asked whether he was carrying on a family tradition of antipathy towards the Bianconeri. \u201cDad wrote his story,\u201d said the younger Simeone. \u201cI am writing my own.\u201d\nWhat a tale it has been lately. The weekend before, he had hammered four goals past Lazio. It becomes hard to avoid mentioning family ties when you have the most prolific afternoon of your career against the club where your father enjoyed some of the greatest years of his. Diego texted to tell him it was the best he had seen him play, but that was not the reaction that moved Giovanni the most. \u201cThe [Verona] storekeeper, Antonio, got emotional, started to cry and hugged me,\u201d he said, two days later. \u201cIt was really touching. We are like a family here.\u201d\nVerona have made a dramatic start to the season: losing their first three games and firing the manager, Eusebio Di Francesco, before transforming into one of the most entertaining teams in Serie A under his replacement, Igor Tudor. They have scored 21 goals in eight matches since \u2013 more than any other team in the division over that stretch \u2013 and had claimed wins over Roma and Lazio before they welcomed Juventus to the Bentegodi on Saturday. Most observers expected to see a reaction from the Bianconeri after their midweek defeat to Sassuolo. Instead, Simeone pounced before they could get a foothold in the game. In the 11th minute, he swept home a rebound after Antonin Barak\u2019s shot was blocked. Three minutes later, he struck again: firing from outside the box into the top right corner after cutting in from the left.\nJuventus\u2019s defence was at fault, backing off and affording him space, but this was a finish few ould have pulled off. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny had plenty of time to see the shot coming but the precise trajectory gave him no chance. Simeone put the ball in the net a third time before the half-hour mark but was denied a hat-trick due to a foul by Gianluca Caprari. On another day, that missed opportunity may have come back to haunt Verona. Paulo Dybala hit the woodwork for Juventus and Weston McKennie saw a shot saved at point-blank range before finally pulling one goal back. But that was all the Old Lady could manage. Defeat was a catastrophe for Juventus, leaving them 16 points off the pace at the top of Serie A. Their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, described their league position as shameful. Talk of winning back the Scudetto they surrendered last season for the first time in a decade has been replaced with questions about whether they can get back into the top four.\nNone of which is for Simeone to worry about. This was the most extraordinary week of his career, scoring six times in seven days despite starting two of three games. He played the last 24 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Udinese on Wednesday, replacing Nikola Kalinic, without getting his name on the scoresheet. Simeone owes a debt to Tudor, who outmanoeuvred Allegri just as he had done to Maurizio Sarri and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho before. Stationing the left wing-back, Darko Lazovic, high up the pitch, the manager forced Juan Cuadrado to play a more defensive game and obliged Juventus to attack down the left, where Alex Sandro has been less effective. Lazovic, Barak and Caprari have thrived under the new manager, who served as an assistant to Andrea Pirlo at Juventus last season. Some in Turin are starting to wonder whether he ought to have been given the top job, but Tudor has benefited also from a Verona dressing room pulling in the same direction. Even before embarking on his scoring spree, Simeone had spoken of his close relationship with Kalinic \u2013 who he is alternates games with up front. \u201cUsually, players in the same role don\u2019t talk much because of the rivalry [for places],\u201d he said at the start of last month. \u201cBetween us two, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\nIt may become harder for Tudor to keep rotating if Simeone maintains this form. His eight Serie A goals are second only to the nine scored by Fiorentina\u2019s Dusan Vlahovic. Cautious minds will point out e has had hot streaks before, but never sustained that form through a full campaign. He has yet to top the 14 goals he scored while playing for the Viola in 2017-18. Last season at Cagliari, he struck five times before the end of October and once more thereafter. He was playing for a struggling team and had his best stretch of form interrupted by coronavirus, but has said he could have done more. Simeone has credited his own improvement to a renewed work ethic, saying he was in the gym every day over the summer \u2013 even while on his honeymoon. He has spoken about using daily meditation to keep himself on track, as well as other techniques. Simeone claimed to have woken up before the Lazio game feeling not quite right, but corrected those sensations with mobility exercises and then concentration games using his computer.\nFinally, he watched a Rocky movie. \u201cI always do that when I need an extra little charge,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a phrase from Rocky I always think about: it says that life will often put you on your knees and the important thing isn\u2019t how many times you hit, but how often you get hit and then get back up.\u201d Perhaps Juve\u2019s players are the ones who need to hear that message after being knocked to the canvas twice in one week. Verona are no title contenders, but they head into another high-profile bout with the joint-leaders Napoli next Sunday knowing that with Simeone in this sort of form they will always have a puncher\u2019s chance.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/01/giovanni-simeone-verona-juventus-serie-a", "last_update": "2021-11-01T13:29:37Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Tom Cruise was an intense kid\u2019: How Francis Ford Coppola made The Outsiders", "article": "Francis Ford Coppola, director After my 1982 film One from the Heart failed commercially, my production company American Zoetrope was bankrupt \u2013 it was a low period for me. But then I received a letter written by Jo Ellen Misakian, a junior school librarian from Fresno, California. It read: \u201cWe are all so impressed with the book, The Outsiders by SE Hinton, that a petition has been circulated asking that it be made into a movie. We have chosen you to send it to.\u201d It contained about 15 pages of children\u2019s signatures written in different-coloured pens. It was very moving. I read Susan Hinton\u2019s book, written when she was in her late teens, and was touched by the level of regard these poor \u201cGreaser\u201d kids had for each other, even though they didn\u2019t have the advantages of their \u201cSocial\u201d rivals. I\u2019ve always believed that kids have many more feelings than we give them credit for, and I wanted to make the story. When I was about 17, I had been a drama counsellor at a summer camp, and the idea of being with half a dozen kids in the country and making a movie seemed like being a camp counsellor again. I\u2019d forget my troubles and have some laughs.\nIf my company was famous for anything, it was casting new, unknown actors. I believed in the concept of open casting calls \u2013 but I tried to do them in a way that was appropriate for the film we were making. For The Outsiders, I had all the candidates \u2013 which included Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Robert Downey Jr, Patrick Swayze, Dennis Quaid, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez \u2013 sitting on benches in a circle watching each other trying for the different parts. No one knows more about acting than other actors. Tom Cruise, who ended up in a small role, was an intense kid who would do anything to make his part better.\nOften I err on the side of being too collaborative. I re-edited The Outsiders because Warner Brothers felt it was long, and that was a mistake. My father had also written a soaring, romantic score for it. I wondered if it was the right choice, but I couldn\u2019t say that to him. By the time I recut the movie in 2005 he had passed away, and I balanced the schmaltzy music with more of what the Greasers would have listened to: early Elvis Presley and stuff like that. There are parallels between the rivalry of the Socs and the Greasers, and the inequality in American today. Most of the bads of contemporary civilisation are not caused by nature. Civilisation invents fictions that people will kill for, which is absurd. Why is there such inequality when we\u2019re all one family?\nC Thomas Howell, who played Ponyboy Curtis I had established myself in my teens as a junior rodeo competitor. Pressure for me was riding a bull, not meeting someone called Francis Ford Coppola, or auditioning against the other guys. I only auditioned for one character, Ponyboy Curtis, and read with hundreds of actors in four or five cities. The only time I ever felt any pressure was when Norman Mailer\u2019s son came in to read for it weeks after I felt I had already owned the role. But I think actually that was more about relieving me for half a day. There was an envy that was intentionally dialled in to the Soc and Greaser actors. We played football and basketball against each other \u2013 they had matching jumpsuits, while we\u2019d show up in whatever we brought from home. The Socs stayed on floor 18 or 19 of the hotel, while the Greasers were on four or five. It was like a fraternity house in there; some pretty crazy stuff took place. Once I got home at three in the morning after an 18-hour shift; I couldn\u2019t wait to get into my room and go to sleep. And I went in there, two of the Socs had turned everything in my room upside down. We rehearsed and shot the whole film on videotape first, which allowed us to get to know each other and created a trust. I was very green at 15. I had been in ET, but I had never played a lead. Francis was a master communicator, and taught me about film-making. He was patient enough to not just bully his way around and tell you what to do. And he\u2019d cook you pasta for lunch. One lesson I learned was to never, as an actor, cut a scene. During the scene at the drive-in cinema, at one point Matt Dillon fell off his chair, and I turned to the camera and started laughing, thinking they\u2019d cut. But he told me I shouldn\u2019t stop, but that I should adapt to what was happening: it creates something very natural, more real and connected than anything that could be written. Later, in the church scene, a dolly grip\u2019s foot fell through the floor \u2013 it was a real abandoned building \u2013 so I just said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a monster outside.\u201d And Francis ended up cutting to a shot of a raccoon outside. The film is peppered with real moments like that. I still get letters about The Outsiders because it\u2019s required reading in a lot of schools. People tell me it\u2019s their comfort film, or they have a Stay Gold tattoo, or they used the Robert Frost poem for their wedding vows. I get asked all the time what the poem means. I had no idea when I was 15 that it represents the circle of life. Even the two boys don\u2019t understand what it means \u2013 they\u2019re just sharing a moment \u2013 until one of them dies. The fans are crying and upset that [Ralph Macchio\u2019s character] Johnny is dead, and then they contact me and they realise Ponyboy is now 54 \u2013 and they cry even harder. \u2022 The Outsiders: The Complete Novel is available on Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms from 8 November", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/01/how-we-made-the-outsiders-francis-ford-coppola-and-c-thomas-howell", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:58:59Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Nearly two-thirds of those who died young in 2019 were male, research finds", "article": "Boys and men are more likely than women to die as teenagers or young adults, according to new research that warns the gender gap in mortality rates for that age group is widening in many countries. In 2019, nearly two thirds (61%) of all deaths among 10- to 24-year-olds worldwide occurred in males, said the research published in the Lancet last week. Since 1950, mortality rates in males aged 10 to 24 have decreased by 15.3%, lagging behind improvements in female mortality rates, which decreased by 30% in this age group. Differences in mortality were greatest in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the mortality rate in men aged 20 to 24 was more than three times that for women. Interpersonal violence and conflict were the leading cause of death for men aged 15 to 24 in this region, where, over the past 20 years, there has been little to no improvement in mortality for this age group, said the research. Leading causes of death for men in 2019 varied according to age and region. In men aged 10 to 14, most deaths were due to accidents in all regions except high-income ones, where cancer was the leading cause, and south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where it was diseases from consuming contaminated food or water. In men aged 15 to 24, the most common cause of death was \u201ctransport injury\u201d in almost all regions. The research said that widening gender inequities in many regions have been driven by poor progress in addressing the leading causes of death for boys and young men. Joseph Ward, of University College London\u2019s child health institute, one of the authors of the research, said: \u201cHigh numbers of deaths in males indicate increases in the proportion of deaths due to violence, trauma and substance misuse, which predominately affect young males. This reflects a failure to address some of the leading causes of mortality in this age group.\u201d\nThe report also suggested that young people in the 10\u201324 age group were being neglected by policymakers and that the Covid-19 pandemic would probably jeopardise efforts to improve mortality rates. The research said while programmes to address the social conditions in which young women live, and the impact of violence against them, were fundamental to improving adolescent health globally, boys had been left behind. \u201cInequitable gender norms are also damaging to adolescent males, and advancing the health of all adolescents requires action to reduce inequities in outcomes wherever they occur,\u201d it said. Ward added that improvements in mortality rates in 10- to 24-year-olds generally were lagging behind other age groups. He said policymakers had failed to address the specific health risks of this age group and adolescent-specific programmes were insufficiently funded. This was highlighted by many countries having \u201crelatively good mortality outcomes for young children, but some of the highest mortality globally in adolescent age groups\u201d, he said. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen the slowest improvements in mortality rates, added Ward, resulting in the burden of global deaths in these age groups shifting towards that region. This article was amended on 2 November 2021. The report found that in 2019 males accounted for 61% of deaths of 10- to 24-year-olds, not that males aged 10 to 24 accounted for 61% of all global deaths as stated in an earlier version due to an editing error.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/01/nearly-two-thirds-of-those-who-died-young-in-2019-were-male-research-finds", "last_update": "2021-11-02T12:18:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Nubya Garcia review \u2013 music does the talking in triumphant comeback", "article": "Iggy Pop said recently that whenever he hears anyone moan that music isn\u2019t as good as it used to be, he points them to Nubya Garcia. His description of her \u201cfantastically advanced music that tugs at the heartstrings\u201d refers to how the 30-year-old Londoner of Guyanese and Trinidadian descent infuses jazz with influences from the African and Caribbean diaspora and uses her tenor saxophone to channel a multitude of feelings and emotions. Garcia does this so brilliantly that she doesn\u2019t need to sing, but uses a vocal microphone to talk though. \u201cWow, we made it!\u201d she begins, surveying the audience with the last 18 months in mind. This tour, like so many, was delayed by the pandemic, but the intervening period has seen a Mercury nomination for 2020\u2019s Source and a sellout audience here, making her comeback feel triumphant. Each time she places her instrument to her lips, there is another wave of cheering.

The extended, more mournful bass introduction to the bustling Pace \u2013 originally written, pre-pandemic, about London \u2013 seems to reflect Covid\u2019s impact on our speed and quality of life.

{"title": "With the planet in peril, we religious leaders must speak truth to power | Jonathan Wittenberg ", "article": "Two thousand years ago, Ecclesiastes taught that even a king is subservient to the soil. That includes prime ministers and chancellors; we are all dependent on and an interdependent part of nature. Never before has there been a time when it is so urgent to budget for the benefit of the Earth. I am one of millions who imagined that Boris Johnson\u2019s promise last year to \u201cbuild back greener\u201d was truly intended. I expected that the government of the country, entrusted with hosting Cop26 \u2013 the most important gathering ever for the future of our planet \u2013 would show that it means what it says and put its money where its slogans are.\nWednesday\u2019s budget dashed these hopes. One congregant told me: \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to listen after hearing that fuel tax on inland flights would be cut.\u201d It\u2019s hard to understand why flying would be rewarded on precisely those journeys which could, and should, be made by train. It undermines the justification for building HS2, with the huge damage inflicted on ancient woodlands, if rail travel is not prioritised. Equally incomprehensible is the continued freeze on car fuel, when the infrastructure for electric cars and lorries so desperately needs proper funding. One of the key demands of Faith for the Climate is the ending of subsidies and support for fossil fuels, at home and across the globe. Why give the opposite message? No less dispiriting is what\u2019s absent from the budget: serious incentives for the development of the green economy and the much-needed jobs it promises to offer. Innumerable business leaders have urged the government to offer such encouragement, including members of the government\u2019s own Climate Change Committee and its chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Money urgently needed to enable the world\u2019s poorest, most affected countries to adapt to climate change is also not evidently forthcoming.\nAs a founding rabbi of EcoSynagogue, working closely with Eco Church and senior faith and environmental leaders across the world, I am passionately engaged with climate justice, global warming and biodiversity. The Hebrew Bible sees human beings as guardians of the Earth, entrusted to work it for the benefit of all life. The Bible\u2019s central values are justice and compassion. The Torah repeatedly reminds us of our responsibility to our children. We owe them the legacy of a viable and sustainable planet, rich in life. We are not entitled to commodify, monetise and exploit creation. We are not entitled to follow short-term self-interest only. It\u2019s not a case of \u201cTomorrow we may die\u201d, but \u201cTomorrow they, the world\u2019s children, will die\u201d. The future of all life is in our hands. These principles, by which I seek to live as a Jew, are shared by all religions and innumerable people of no faith alike. Deeper than the anger are the anguish and fear I experience and share with so many. I feel desperate that, while lip service is duly paid to what we know we need to do, in the UK and across the world, the government\u2019s actions point in a different direction. Where the money goes is what sends the real message. Yet the time is right for change. Covid has led to a deeper awareness of our interdependence as a society; we\u2019ve learned to value people whose work we took for granted: hospital teams, men and women who fill the shelves in the shops, keep the buses on the road and collect our rubbish. We\u2019ve been vividly presented with the interconnectedness of the fate of humanity across the globe. We\u2019ve experienced more closely than before our interconnectedness and interdependence with nature. These are learnings we cannot afford to squander. Faith leaders will be strongly represented at Cop26; Pope Francis himself will be attending. We will be working together across our religions, determined to live by our values and tell truth to power. We are not about to give up.

{"title": "Spurs have one of the great stadiums and all it cost them was the team | Jonathan Wilson", "article": "There were always going to be boos from one end of the ground or the other and, as Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side pulled off another of those increasingly familiar job-saving victories, they came from Spurs fans. At half-time, at full time and, probably most significantly, when Lucas Moura was taken off for Steven Bergwijn. By the end there were chants against the chairman, Daniel Levy. Saturday\u2019s defeat proved to be the last of Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s short reign as Spurs manager as Levy took decisive action. Manchester United were more solid than they have been. There may be problems ahead if Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho and Paul Pogba have to go without regular football for a protracted spell, but for now the 3-4-1-2 has brought short-term relief. Solskj\u00e6r at least has the fallback of good players who can do brilliant things \u2013 Nuno was not so fortunate.\nWith the exception of Son Heung-min \u2013 and, being generous, Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg \u2013 nobody at Spurs is playing well at the moment. There is nobody in this side who one can really imagine being part of a successful Tottenham team in two or three years\u2019 time. Everybody, from Harry Kane to Eric Dier, from Dele Alli to Cristian Romero, seems not quite what he used to be. This is what happens when a squad goes stale en masse. Even Nuno appeared diminished, the sage of Molineux turned into something altogether damper. The reserve that seems like intelligent restraint when things are going well can quickly come to seem ineffectual when results and performances go awry. And as everything declines, the poverty of the team and its football is only highlighted by the magnificence of the surroundings. Spurs have one of the greatest stadiums in the world; all it cost them was the team. In that sense, the fury at Levy is understandable. Future generations of Tottenham fans may have cause to be extremely grateful to him \u2013 without excess spending, he has provided the infrastructure for Tottenham to be a great club. But they may equally come to regard him as an eccentric who built a magnificent garage with every conceivable amenity and then chose to house within it only a rusted old jalopy. This generation, certainly, is entitled to feel frustrated. It is not even a case of wondering whether the cost was too great: could they maybe have scaled back on the luxury and bought a midfielder? There is also now the sense that, on top of the economic gamble the club took, as well as having to suffer some shortfall of investment on the playing side to achieve the new stadium, a series of bad decisions have been made.\nIt was not just in those final couple of years under Mauricio Pochettino that there was a lack of expenditure on players: it was that too few players were sold. Entropy is the curse against which all managers must constantly fight: if the manager is to establish a dynasty, if he is to defy Bela Guttmann\u2019s Three-Year Rule, there has to be constant rejuvenation. That is perhaps particularly true of managers who demand the intensity that Pochettino does (which is why he is such a curious fit for Paris Saint-Germain). The model there, perhaps, different as their football may be, is his fellow Argentinian Diego Simeone, now in his 11th season at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, thanks at least in part to a capacity for offloading players at the right time (often bringing them back once they\u2019ve been refreshed and come to appreciate the value of his demanding style). That process was never enacted. Perhaps the club was wary of offloading players who had made them seem worthy of the new stadium. Perhaps there were few buyers. Perhaps the focus on the stadium was a distraction. Perhaps Levy\u2019s notoriously tough bargaining was to blame. But whatever the reason, the result was stagnation. Even then the situation was soluble. Even with the financial hit of the pandemic, and the gleaming new arena sitting empty, Pochettino had credit in the bank. He could have been given time to reconstruct his squad. But instead Levy made his gravest error: he not merely dismissed Pochettino, he also appointed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a decision that looks increasingly inexplicable with hindsight, as though he felt the need to act like a big club by appointing a big-club manager. There were only three problems: Mourinho is not a man to build on a limited budget, his best days were at least a decade in the past, and a big-club manager comes with a big-club cost. The consequence is the current malaise: a squad whose morale is broken, in a first-rate stadium that offers a constant reminder that only two years ago Tottenham were in the Champions League final. Nuno\u2019s ill-fated appointment \u2013 everybody knows he was nowhere near Spurs\u2019 first choice \u2013 has also undermined faith in the sporting director, Fabio Paratici.\nUnderlying all of that is the status anxiety that seemed to underlie the reluctance seriously to contemplate selling Kane \u2013 a symbol of big-clubdom \u2013 the fee for whom could have begun the process of rejuvenation. That is assuming Paratici could have been trusted to spend it well \u2013 he may have been serenaded by the fans on his arrival but his early record does little to inspire confidence. Getting rid of Nuno leaves Spurs back in the position they were in six months ago when Mourinho was dismissed. This crisis is far deeper rooted than that. \u2022 This article was originally published on 31 October, and updated following the sacking of Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo on 1 November.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/oct/31/spurs-tottenham-hotspur-stadium-daniel-levy-fans-fury", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:07:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Highway One review \u2013 lo-fi indie movie gets lost on way to the party", "article": "It would be great to say that this lo-fi movie from Mississippi film-maker Jaclyn Bethany, set in a single location at a small-town New Year\u2019s Eve party, was an indie find. Sadly it\u2019s like a flabbily conceived and impossibly indulgent student film, and the meta-level of reality disclosed at the end is supercilious; it adds nothing to this unfunny and laborious piece of work with its muddy lighting, flat sound design and torpid, almost indistinguishable performances. However, the appearance of child actor Ivy George, playing a little girl who\u2019s been sent by her family to complain about the party\u2019s noise (and concealing a hidden motive) does pep things up a little. The drama takes place in the Californian town of Cambria on Highway One between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Maria (Aisha Fabienne Ross) is one of many young people at this party vocal-frying their lines to each other. She is disturbed (though the acting here doesn\u2019t give much of a clue) to hear that someone called Nina (Juliette Labelle) is going to show up; this was the woman who left the neighbourhood 10 years before to follow her dream of acting in New York: Maria once had feelings for Nina. What will happen when they see each other again?\nThe answer, bafflingly, is \u2026 not a whole heck of a lot. There seems to be no great emotional charge to their reunion, which was promising so much, and the drama does not concentrate all that clearly on it in any case, constantly straying away to all the other silly, unfunny little subplots: a guy with a mysterious Russian accent, an ethereal young woman dating her professor, a flippant and haughty Brit whingeing about being dumped.

{"title": "End of the avocado: why chefs are ditching the unsustainable fruit", "article": "On the one hand, they are deliciously creamy, versatile and gloriously Instagrammable. On the other, they have an enormous carbon footprint, require 320 litres of water each to grow and \u201care in such global demand they are becoming unaffordable for people indigenous to the areas they are grown in\u201d, according to Thomasina Miers, the co-founder of the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca. For some time, the chef has struggled to balance the devastating environmental impact of avocado production with her customers\u2019 appetite for guacamole. Now, she thinks she has found the answer: a vibrant, green guacamole-inspired dip, made from fava beans, green chilli, lime and coriander.\nThe dip \u2013 called Wahacamole \u2013 debuted last month, but Wahaca is not the first restaurant to remove or reduce its reliance on avocado. In Toronto, the Mexican chef Aldo Camarena recently suggested a guacamole alternative made with courgette and pumpkin seed paste. Last year, the chef Santiago Lastra included a guacamole-style dip made from pistachios and fermented gooseberries on the menu at Kol, his Mexican restaurant in London. In 2018, the Irish restaurateur JP McMahon called avocados the \u201cblood diamonds of Mexico\u201d; he has developed a guacamole alternative made using jerusalem artichokes. This trend is not confined to the restaurant industry. Last month, the TikTok star Calum Harris (AKA @madebyblitz) garnered 371,000 likes on his recipe for \u201cguacamole\u201d made with frozen peas, while, on Instagram, the hashtag #noavocado has 3,220 posts and counting.\n\u201cA few years ago, I was quite well known for my use of avocados in my cooking \u2013 so much so that I dedicated a whole Instagram account (@avodaily) to my love for them,\u201d says the vegan cookery writer Bettina Campolucci Bordi. She decided to cut back when she moved to the UK, having previously lived in Spain, where she could source avocados locally. \u201cMy favourite recipe to date uses British peas instead. I blanche the peas before crushing them and mixing them with plant-based sour cream, salt and pepper, a little grated garlic and a spritz of lemon juice.\u201d\nWahaca\u2019s decision to offer an alternative to guacamole is perhaps the clearest indication to date that \u201cparts of the food industry are beginning to wake up to the enormity of the issues we face as a result of intensive farming\u201d, says Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City, University of London. Avocados have become a \u201cglobal commodity crop\u201d, he says, the perfect example of what happens when \u201can exotic food becomes normalised with no thinking through of the consequences\u201d. Problems including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and water shortages mean that \u201cthe communities growing them do not have enough water for washing and hygiene\u201d, adds Lang. But avocados are challenging to replace \u2013 as are their derivatives, avocado oil and avocado butter, which are important in gluten-free and vegan baking. Plus, for many fans of the fruit, a dip made from beans, nuts, seeds or vegetables is no more a replacement for guacamole than smashed broad beans on toast (as suggested by Tom Hunt\u2019s recipe for not-avocado on toast) is an alternative to smashed avocado. Perhaps anticipating this complaint, Wahaca has said that \u201ca traditional, freshly made guacamole\u201d will remain on its menu, for which all of its avocados are \u201csourced at the most sustainable levels possible\u201d.\nMiers, who worked with the British pulse grower Hodmedod\u2019s to create Wahacamole, says: \u201cThe fact that we can grow [fava beans in the UK] using regenerative farming methods that fix both nitrogen and carbon into our soil is an added boon.\u201d While guacamole swaps may not exactly replicate the taste of avocado, the feedback has been good at Wahaca. \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving people Wahacamole to try for free when they come in to dine with us \u2013 and on the whole they seem genuinely interested in giving it a go. Most are enjoying it and many are ordering more,\u201d says Miers. Lastra says: \u201cWe were looking not to recreate, but to produce a similar sensorial experience. What does an avocado mean in terms of sight, texture, aroma and flavour? And how do we paint that with the tools we have?\u201d His blend of pistachios, pine oil, cucumber juice and fermented gooseberries may not fool an avocado connoisseur, but Lastra tells me most people \u201ccan\u2019t actually tell the difference \u2026 they really enjoy it\u201d. It has all the creaminess, tang and colour of traditional guacamole, he says \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t look bad on Instagram, either.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/01/end-of-the-avocado-why-chefs-ditching-the-unsustainable-fruit", "last_update": "2021-11-01T13:56:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Not going to cop sledging\u2019: Scott Morrison hits back at Macron in row over submarine deal ", "article": "Scott Morrison has hit back against an extraordinary accusation from the French president that Australia\u2019s prime minister lied to him over an abandoned $90bn submarine contract, declaring he will not \u201ccop sledging\u201d about Australia\u2019s integrity. Speaking to reporters in Glasgow where he is attending the UN climate conference Cop26, Morrison said Emmanuel Macron was well aware that Australia was contemplating pulling out of the troubled Naval Group diesel submarine contract. Morrison said he was as transparent as possible with the French president that diesel-powered submarines were not going to meet Australia\u2019s capability needs.\nMorrison said he did not wish to \u201cpersonalise\u201d his rebuttal of Macron\u2019s allegation, delivered on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome. Australia\u2019s prime minister said he had \u201cbroad shoulders\u201d, but he did not intend to take \u201cslurs\u201d about Australia\u2019s national integrity. \u201cI\u2019ve got broad shoulders, I can deal with that. But those slurs, I\u2019m not going to cop sledging of Australia, I\u2019m not going to cop that on behalf of Australians. \u201cI can deal with whatever people throw at me. But Australia has a proud record when it comes to our defence capability.\u201d\nMacron\u2019s target was clearly Morrison when he fired a broadside at his Australian counterpart in Rome, with the French president saying he had a lot of \u201crespect and friendship\u201d for Australia and Australians. A visibly furious Morrison had been blindsided by Macron\u2019s impromptu remarks at the conclusion of the G20 meeting in Rome on Sunday night. In an exercise in damage control, text messages from the French president were leaked to some Australian media outlets. One leaked Macron text two days before Australia cancelled the Naval group contract and unveiled the Aukus pact with the United States and Britain had the president asking Australia\u2019s prime minister: \u201cShould I expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions?\u201d But the leaked message shared to reinforce Australia\u2019s position confirmed that Macron did not know which way Australia would go on the eve of the Aukus pact being announced. Morrison was asked on Monday why Macron\u2019s private messages had been leaked. The prime minister said he didn\u2019t intend to \u201cindulge your editorial on that\u201d. He insisted that Macron\u2019s claim to have been blindsided by the cancellation of the contract was contradicted by France\u2019s own actions after the two leaders dined at the Elysee Palace after a G7 summit in the middle of the year.\nMorrison says he conveyed Australia\u2019s significant hesitations about the Naval Group contract at that point. But he said he was not at that time in a position to be entirely candid with Macron about his plan to acquire nuclear submarines through the Aukus pact. \u201cThe suggestion that these things were not raised [with Macron] does not gel with the way the French defence system flew into action the very next day [after the dinner in Paris],\u201d Morrison said. He noted a French admiral had been sent to Australia to \u201ctry and save the contract after our dinner in Elysee\u201d. Morrison said France would not have launched a rearguard action to save the multibillion dollar deal on that scale \u201cif there was no concern about the contract being under threat\u201d. Morrison said he also tried to give Macron a heads-up about the Aukus pact before it was unveiled publicly, but the French president wasn\u2019t available to take a call. Morrison said he then texted Macron to say it was important that the two leaders spoke. Asked whether Macron \u2013 an important ally \u2013 deserved better than a last minute heads up, Morrison said: \u201cThis was a highly secure decision, a highly secure environment over which we had held these things incredibly tightly \u2026 for more than a year.\u201d \u201c[Macron] was clearly aware over some months that there were concerns, and they were responding to those concerns, and we had correspondence and other messaging during the course of that period,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe decided in Australia\u2019s interests not to go ahead with the [Naval Group] contract,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a contract, it had a gate, and that gate should have actually been passed through last December.\u201d \u201cDelays in the contract meant that didn\u2019t occur and that it extended out well into July. We had not made a decision, which [France] would have been very well aware of, we had still not made a decision on the scope two works, and they were seeking to respond to that. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I am going to take the tough decisions to ensure Australia has the best defence capability.\u201d Morrison eased around a question about whether France had offered to supply Australia with nuclear submarines as an alternative. He told reporters in Glasgow Australia wasn\u2019t interested in that option. He also declined to answer a question about whether he had failed to tell Macron about the Aukus discussion because the Biden administration had sought total secrecy. Morrison has faced public opprobrium about his conduct during the submarine fracas not only from Macron, but also from the US president Joe Biden.

{"title": "Barclays chief Jes Staley steps down after Epstein investigation", "article": "Barclays\u2019 chief executive, Jes Staley, has stepped down after an investigation by the City watchdog over how he described his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The bank said its board reached an agreement over Staley\u2019s resignation after being notified on Friday of the preliminary conclusions in an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority into how Staley had characterised his relationship with Epstein to Barclays. The investigation, which began in late 2019, also considered the way Barclays subsequently described that relationship to the FCA, which covers conduct related issues in the City.\nThe inquiry was launched after emails between Staley and Epstein were handed to UK regulators by their counterparts in the US. The outgoing chief executive plans to challenge the investigation\u2019s findings. Depending on the outcome of his challenge, it could delay or ultimately block regulators from issuing potential fines and penalties, as well as releasing the investigation\u2019s findings to the public. \u201cIn view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley\u2019s intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down from his role as group chief executive and as a director of Barclays,\u201d Barclays said in a statement on Monday morning. \u201cThe board is disappointed at this outcome. Mr Staley has run the Barclays Group successfully since December 2015 with real commitment and skill.\u201d Staley will be replaced by Barclays\u2019 head of global markets, CS Venkatakrishnan, with immediate effect. In an internal memo to staff seen by the Guardian, Staley said: \u201cThe reasons for my decision are simple. The FCA and PRA let me know on Friday evening the draft conclusions of their investigation into the characterisation of a professional relationship I developed earlier in my career. I do not want my personal response to those matters to be a distraction from the fantastic work you do every day to support our customers and clients.\u201d The bank said the investigation did not conclude that Staley \u201csaw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays\u2019 support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019\u201d. The FCA and PRA said in a joint statement that they \u201cdo not comment on ongoing investigations or regulatory proceedings beyond confirming the regulatory actions as detailed in the firm\u2019s announcement\u201d. Staley \u2013 who joined Barclays in 2015 \u2013 has previously said that he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000 while working at JP Morgan, where Epstein had already been a client. Staley stayed in contact with Epstein for seven years after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, and visited Epstein in Florida while the financier was still serving his sentence and out on work release in 2009. Staley said their relationship tapered off after he left JP Morgan. His final visit involved sailing his yacht to Epstein\u2019s private island in 2015. It is not clear why Staley decided to cut ties with the former banking client. Despite his resignation, Staley will still be paid his full \u00a32.4m salary, \u00a3120,000 pension allowance and other benefits, including medical cover and life assurance over the next 12 months. The American banker will also be eligible for relocation costs if he chooses to move back to the US. However, the bank said no decision has yet been made in regard to further payments, which include bonuses or clawbacks. It is understood that those decisions are likely to hinge on the final findings of the FCA and PRA\u2019s investigation. The outgoing boss was paid \u00a34m for 2020, including an annual bonus worth \u00a3843,000. However, he donated about \u00a3392,000 of that total to the bank\u2019s Covid fund. Barclays shares fell 2% to 198p, making it one of the worst-performing stocks on the FTSE 100 on Monday morning, although they later recovered to close just 0.7% down at 201p. New boss for Barclays Barclays has chosen CS Venkatakrishnan \u2013 also known as Venkat \u2013 to take over as chief executive with immediate effect. The bank\u2019s board said it had been working on a succession plan \u201cfor some time\u201d and had identified Venkatakrishnan as its preferred candidate more than a year ago, resulting in his move from chief risk officer to head of global markets in autumn 2020. The new boss \u2013 who, like Staley, also joined Barclays after a career at JP Morgan \u2013 will earn a higher annual salary than his predecessor, worth \u00a32.7m, a sum that will be split equally into cash and shares subject to a five-year holding period. He will also be paid \u00a3135,000 in lieu of pension, receive medical and life assurance benefits and an annual bonus worth up to 93% \u2013 or \u00a32.5m \u2013 of his fixed pay.\nA long-term incentive plan will also give the new boss a chance to earn up to 140% of his fixed pay in any one year, a sum that would currently be worth about \u00a33.8m. Barclays said it had \u201clong been confident in Venkat\u2019s capabilities to run Barclays Group\u201d. \u201cThe board is confident that Barclays under his leadership will continue its strategic direction and improve performance in line with the progress of recent years,\u201d it added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/barclays-jes-staley-steps-down-fca-investigation", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:39:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Flu, cancer, HIV: after Covid success, what next for mRNA vaccines?", "article": "It is one of the most remarkable success stories of the pandemic: the unproven technology that delivered the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines in record time, helping to turn the tide on Covid-19. The vaccines are based on mRNA, the molecule that instructs our cells to make specific proteins. By injecting synthetic mRNA, our cells are turned into on-demand vaccine factories, pumping out any protein we want our immune system to learn to recognise and destroy. Pre-pandemic, the technology was viewed with scepticism \u2013 a clever concept, but not guaranteed to deliver. Now there is growing confidence that mRNA vaccines could have far-reaching applications in tackling diseases from flu to malaria. Flu Every February flu scientists take part in an annual ritual: bets are placed at a World Health Organization meeting on which flu strains will dominate the following winter. There are four influenza viruses in circulation, each rapidly evolving so that the previous year\u2019s vaccines will have lost efficacy. Manufacturers need at least six months to produce vaccines, a laborious process that involves growing attenuated virus inside millions of chicken eggs. When the flu forecast is on target, vaccines can be 60% effective, but a mismatch between vaccines and circulating strains can result in efficacy as low as 10%. The holy grail of flu research is a universal vaccine that would work across all four strains and continue to work for their future incarnations as they shuffle their genomes over time. Such a vaccine would need to target the core influenza protein that doesn\u2019t change much from strain to strain. But our immune systems do not respond strongly to this part of the virus and so the goal has remained elusive for decades. However, mRNA is so quick and easy to produce that vaccines can be designed to strike many sites simultaneously. \u201cSuch a vaccine will likely be able to induce broadly protective responses,\u201d said Norbert Pardi, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. His team is working on a vaccine candidate that will use about a dozen pieces of mRNA and is designed to work across several flu strains. The team hopes to begin human trials in 2023. Cancer The HPV vaccine, which protects against the virus that causes most cervical cancers, already averts thousands of cases of cancer each year. In future, scientists hope that mRNA vaccines could be used to vaccinate against cancer itself by teaching the immune system to recognise mutations before they occur, in an entirely new approach to treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re taking advantage of the known genetic progression of cancer,\u201d said Prof Herbert Kim Lyerly, who is working on cancer vaccine technology at Duke University. His team plans to trial an mRNA vaccine next year in patients with late-stage breast cancer, where tumours typically evolve to be unresponsive to drugs by acquiring mutations in specific genes. Again, an advantage of mRNA is the ability to hit multiple targets at once \u2013 in this case, a handful of potential mutations. \u201cThere\u2019s no better surgeon in the world than your immune system to pick off those [mutated cells] in the early stage,\u201d said Lyerly. The first applications, if successful, could extend a patient\u2019s life by months by keeping cancer at bay for longer. Eventually it may be possible to prevent cancer in certain high-risk populations such as heavy smokers, where a mutation in a gene called KRAS accounts for up to a quarter of cancers. Malaria In October the WHO approved the first rollout of a malaria vaccine. But there is scope for improvement, with the RTS,S vaccine reducing severe malaria by 30%. A fundamental challenge is that the malaria parasite has evolved a way of preventing immunologic memory. Even after catching malaria, let alone being vaccinated, people remain susceptible to reinfection, and the disease kills 500,000 people annually, mostly babies and children. In 2012, Prof Richard Bucala, of Yale School of Medicine, and colleagues discovered that malaria induced this \u201cimmune system amnesia\u201d using a protein called PMIF, which kills memory T-cells. Bucala is working on a form of RNA vaccine that would immunise against PMIF. Studies in mice suggest that blocking the protein allows the immune system to clear malaria quicker, resulting in milder illness and, crucially, future immunity. Bucala has teamed up with scientists at Oxford\u2019s Jenner Vaccine Institute to test the candidate, and if results are positive they hope to begin human trials next year. \u201cVaccines are desperately needed in the developing world for parasitic diseases that have long depressed economic and societal development of many countries,\u201d said Bucala. \u201cRNA has not only enabled the success of our PMIF vaccine but the platform is far less expensive than protein-based vaccines, opening opportunities for a malaria vaccine that have not previously existed.\u201d HIV \u201cWe\u2019re going into the fifth decade now of a global pandemic for HIV,\u201d said Derek Cain, of Duke University\u2019s Human Vaccine Institute. So far, a vaccine has remained out of reach. Cain\u2019s team has focused on a subset of HIV patients (fewer than one-third) who eventually develop specialised antibodies that can neutralise HIV years after infection. By this time there is a huge reservoir of virus in the body, and it is too late to clear the infection. \u201cIt\u2019s like you find a fire extinguisher but the whole house is on fire already,\u201d said Cain. However, if a vaccine could induce these antibodies, the hope is that they could extinguish HIV before it takes hold. Cain and colleagues have meticulously mapped out the circuitous route taken by the immune system to create these highly specialised antibodies, and as part of a consortium they are concocting a sequence of four or five multi-target mRNA vaccines designed to \u201crecreate the arms race between the immune system and the pathogen\u201d. \u201cWe certainly think that an HIV vaccine will be far and away the most complicated vaccine that we\u2019ve ever had to put into the population,\u201d said Cain. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect it to work 100% or 90% like the Covid vaccines, but even if we can get to 50-60% that would be a success; 70% would be amazing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/01/flu-cancer-hiv-after-covid-success-what-next-for-mrna-vaccines", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:10:39Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "UK diesel prices reach record high in blow to households and businesses", "article": "UK diesel prices have reached a record high at the pumps a week after petrol prices hit their highest ever level, in a blow to hard-hit households and small businesses. About 12.5 million diesel-car drivers faced an average price across the UK of 147.94p a litre on 31 October, narrowly surpassing the previous high of 147.93p set on 12 April 2012. Diesel prices have risen by 30p a litre over the past year, driven higher by a sharp rebound in global oil markets, making a full 55-litre tank \u00a316 more expensive. A 55-litre tank of diesel will now cost about \u00a381, up from \u00a365 a year ago, according to the motoring group RAC.\nThe record pump price for diesel came one week after the average daily price for a litre of petrol reached a record 142.94p, in what was described as a \u201ctruly dark day for drivers\u201d. Businesses in particular are expected to bear the brunt of the record diesel prices, according to the RAC. The UK has 4.5m vans, most of which run on diesel, and 525,000 heavy goods vehicles. Simon Williams, a spokesperson for RAC, said although the new record was expected after the historic petrol price highs, it was \u201cstill another body blow to drivers and businesses across the country who were already struggling to cope with rising prices\u201d. \u201cAs well as hitting household budgets this will have a knock-on effect on the price we pay for goods and services, as diesel is very much the fuel of business and, as such, will contribute further to inflation,\u201d he added. Fears over a cost of living crisis this winter have kept a lid on fuel duty. In last week\u2019s autumn budget statement, Rishi Sunak scrapped plans to introduce a 2.84p hike in fuel duty that was expected to cost drivers up to an extra \u00a366 a car each year.\nPump prices have climbed steadily in line with global oil market prices, which have more than doubled from about $40 (\u00a329) a barrel a year ago to about $85 in recent weeks because of a sudden rise in post-pandemic energy demand. \u201cWhile the price of diesel on the forecourt has primarily shot up due the cost of a barrel of oil doubling in the last year from about $40 to more than $80, the price of biodiesel is now two-and-a-half times what it was 12 months ago,\u201d Williams said. The global energy supply crisis has also caused gas markets to rocket to record highs, which could lead to historic winter heating bills. Squeezed suppliers have been hit by soaring wholesale prices, while the amount they can charge consumers is limited by the energy cap. On Monday, Bluegreen Energy, which has 5,900 domestic customers, became the 15th supplier to collapse since early August. The government hopes to break the UK\u2019s reliance on gas boilers by offering \u00a35,000 grants to help homes switch to electric heat pumps. But Chris O\u2019Shea, the boss of the British Gas owner Centrica, warned that another 40,000 heating engineers would be needed to meet the government\u2019s ambition to retrofit millions of homes over the next decade. \u201cWe do have a real shortage,\u201d he told a side event at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Global oil prices are expected to continue to rise this year, and many banks have raised their market price forecasts to between $90 and $100 a barrel. Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of US investment giant BlackRock, said last week: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a high probability of $100 oil.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/uk-diesel-prices-record-high", "last_update": "2021-11-01T18:26:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "French fishing industry divided over sanctions on UK trawlers", "article": "France\u2019s seafood sector is divided over government sanctions on British trawlers due to start on Tuesday, with processing companies warning they will cost jobs but fishers insisting that after 10 months waiting for UK permits, tough action is needed. Paris has said it could ban British trawlers from unloading in French ports, carry out extra licence checks on boats, tighten checks on trucks and reinforce customs and hygiene controls unless London grants more licences to fish in UK waters. But the head of the fish wholesale association in Boulogne, France\u2019s largest fishing port, said the planned measures were \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, warning they risked doing more harm to the sector overall than good. \u201cOur processing businesses absolutely need British products, which represent about 25-30% of our deliveries,\u201d Aymeric Chrzan told French radio, adding that France imported more seafood from the UK than is sold in French fish markets. \u201cThe stake as are high for the whole fisheries sector \u2013 not just the wholesalers but the processing and salting companies,\u201d Chrzan said, warning that up to 1,500 fish and seafood sector jobs out of a total of 5,000 in Boulogne could be at risk. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Monday that France had 48 hours to back down or the UK would begin dispute talks. President Emmanuel Macron said the ball was in Britain\u2019s court and that France had tabled concrete de-escalation proposals. Chrzan said the sanctions would lead to \u201cdelays at the very least. Since we work with fresh fish and just-in-time deliveries, any hold-ups can be catastrophic.\u201d He said, however, that Britain should \u201crespect its commitments\u201d under the Brexit deal. \u201cWe need a measured response and rapid solutions in both countries\u2019 interests,\u201d he said. Arnaud Delegorge, the managing director of one processing company, Marine SAS, told local media his firm processed 7,000 tonnes of Scottish salmon each year. \u201cOf course we will suffer if the planned sanctions are implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we stop British fish entering the French market we will really be shooting ourselves in the foot \u2013 we\u2019re talking thousands of jobs here.\u201d However, Olivier Lepretre, the head of the Hauts-de-France regional fishers association, said his members had requested 80 licences to fish in UK waters but had so far been granted 35. \u201cSome have seen their incomes fall by up to 50%,\u201d he said. Lepretre said those businesses concerned \u201cwill be in seriously difficulty very quickly. We need a solution, urgently. It\u2019s a real problem. These boats are confined to French waters which as a result now risk being overfished.\u201d Fishers \u201creally don\u2019t care about the politics\u201d, he said. \u201cThey just want to work, to go to sea. But they\u2019re reaching the end of their tether now, because we\u2019ve been waiting for 10 months. Unless something gives, some are going to go under.\u201d One Boulogne fisher who asked not to be named told French television: \u201cAfter all this time, we need concrete steps.

{"title": "Britains\u2019s prisons are becoming ever more like the failed US system | Duncan Campbell", "article": "Just around the corner from where the Krays used to hold sway in east London\u2019s Brick Lane there is an establishment called Alcotraz. Described as \u201cLondon\u2019s first immersive theatrical cocktail bar\u201d, Alcotraz allows you to dress up in a prison uniform, get locked up in a cell, have a cocktail or two, and get your photo taken. So Britain is channelling \u2013 in the cause of entertainment \u2013 a famous prison in the United States. But look closely and you\u2019ll see that we are also mirroring that country\u2019s relentlessly unforgiving and counterproductive penal policy. Earlier this year, the prime minister joked that Britain was now \u201cprobably the Saudi Arabia of penal policy, under our wonderful home secretary\u201d. In October, the Prison Reform Trust published a report which showed that there had been a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase in the number of people serving long prison sentences, with far more people now serving very lengthy terms. Nearly 11,000 people in prison in England and Wales will spend at least 10 years in custody. More than two-thirds of them are serving indeterminate sentences and do not know when \u2013 or if \u2013 they will be released. Prison numbers will also inevitably increase if the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill becomes law. The bill creates new offences that will essentially criminalise the lifestyles of Gypsies and Travellers and bump up the overall prison population with increased sentences for protesters. The new nationality and borders bill means that those arriving in Britain illegally could now be jailed for up to four years. In addition, a growing number of people on parole are being recalled to prison on the basis of dubious information as the probation service stumbles to recover from the then justice secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s disastrous decision to privatise parts of it in 2014. On 21 October, Kevin Lane, one of those wrongly recalled and only recently released from prison, held a rally in front of the House of Commons to draw attention to this scandal. \u201cThe landings are full of people who should be on parole but are back in prison,\u201d he said.\nThe whole criminal justice system is in a chaotic state, partly \u2013 but far from entirely \u2013 because of Covid-19. Of the 320 magistrates courts that existed in England and Wales in 2010, 164 have been sold off to developers for a total of \u00a3223m and turned into hotels and apartments. In Scotland, 17 sheriff and justice of the peace courts were sold off or closed in the past decade. All of which makes it harder for lawyers, members of the public \u2013 and reporters \u2013 to attend courts and see what sort of sentences are being handed down. September\u2019s justice committee report suggested that as many as 70% of prisoners in England and Wales may have mental health issues. During Covid lockdowns many of us talked of being \u201cstir-crazy\u201d. For prisoners, often confined to their cells for 23 hours a day and heavily restricted from learning new skills or studying because of staff shortages, being driven crazy is now a daily reality. There is also a drugs epidemic inside, with \u201cspice\u201d \u2013 with all its wild and dangerous side-effects \u2013 widely available. In Scotland, which at least has a government more conscious of the problems of drug-related crime, the prison population is also surging. The number of those behind bars has risen sharply to an annual average of around 8,200 in 2019-2020. According to the Howard League Scotland, around a quarter of those inside are awaiting trial and have not yet been convicted. Maybe the owners of Alcotraz will not be able to resist opening something called Bar Linnie in Glasgow for anyone else anxious for that \u201cepic yet intimate\u201d cocktail experience. Britain currently leads its western European neighbours in terms of inmates per head of population. England and Wales jail 138 of their population per 100,000; Scotland 147. Compare that with 76 in Germany and 59 in the Netherlands and Norway. Even Spain (123), Italy (101) and France (105) lag behind us. Maybe not quite \u201cworld-beaters\u201d yet but at least we can defeat those pesky Europeans at something. But where \u2013 as many have asked about the response to the recent report on the government\u2019s early failings over Covid-19 \u2013 is the anger? In 1910, a young home secretary, Winston Churchill, the same one our current prime minister bases himself upon, said that \u201cthe mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country\u201d. It\u2019s a test this country is now shamefully failing.

{"title": "Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for pumpkin caponata | A kitchen in Rome", "article": "We found a pumpkin in the swimming pool car park one day last summer. My son spotted it and, thinking it was a toy half hidden in the leaning bamboo that marks the end of the plot, ran to get it. For a moment, I thought he\u2019d found a mannequin limb, a short leg or a long arm, and yelled at him to put it back. But it was too late; the extremely long, putty-coloured pumpkin was running towards me, and the next thing I knew it was in the car and coming home with us. We washed it, measured it (1.2m) and found out it was a zucca lunga, but decided it looked like a lute crossed with a baseball bat. We then came up with fantastical reasons as to why it was in a swimming pool car park, before balancing it on the top of the cupboard. That was two months ago now, and every couple of days it catches my eye, a strange souvenir from the summer, and hints at what to cook. Although not the souvenir, but rather something bought from Marco on Testaccio market, who grows and sells different varieties of pumpkins and squashes (all of which he calls zucca) that sit like people on a bench on the shelf at the back of his stall. There seems no urgency about pumpkins and squashes. It\u2019s as if they know their longevity, that they will be great the next day or in two months, so they can sit back while other more desperate vegetables vie for attention. All that changes when they are cut and flash their orange insides \u2013 then they do demand attention. Whether that\u2019s sliced and baked, or made into soup or a puree, or stirred into a risotto or fried for caponata. Caponata, the agrodolce Sicilian dish, is most commonly made with aubergine as the main element, supported by celery, onion, tomato, capers, olives, sugar and vinegar (plus variations). Traditionally, it was a summer dish, a way of enjoying and dealing with the abundance of aubergines. My Sicilian mother-in-law, whose parents were farmers on the south coast and grew aubergines, talks of how caponata was a persistent presence in the summer. Also of how, as summer drew to an end, her mother would add enough sugar and vinegar that it became a dark, demanding relish and could last into autumn. The caponata principle does not end with summer, though, because aubergines, like most things, are available all the time these days, and also because there is a caponata for all seasons: aubergines are replaced by apples or pears in winter, artichokes in spring, and pumpkins or squashes in autumn. The singularity of aubergines lies in the way they become rich and velvety when fried. Squash and pumpkin are more silky, but much denser, which makes for a different but still brilliant dish, and the celery feels even more essential here. A summer souvenir adapted for autumn, butternut caponata fits in almost everywhere, but is especially good with sausages. Ours is still on top of the cupboard. Pumpkin or butternut caponata Serves 4-6 Oil, for frying or baking 1kg butternut squash or pumpkin, cut into 1-2cm cubes Salt 4 stalks celery 1 handful capers, ideally packed in salt 1 handful olives 1 large red onion, peeled and sliced into half-moons 200ml tomato sauce or passata 50g currants (optional) 30g pine nuts or almonds (optional) 50g sugar 50ml red-wine vinegar Heat 5cm oil in a small, deep, heavy-based frying pan, then fry the diced squash in batches until golden brown, drain and sprinkle with salt. Alternatively, put the cubes on an oven tray, rub with oil and sprinkle with salt, and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 until golden. Trim the celery stalks of any tough ends or strings, then cut them in half. Drop the celery into a pan of boiling water and cook for about five minutes, until tender but still with bite. Drain the celery and, once cool enough to handle, chop into 1cm chunks and set aside. If the capers are salted, soak them for two minutes, then drain; if brined or in vinegar, drain and rinse. Pit the olives. In a large, deep frying pan, warm four tablespoons of oil over a medium-low heat, add the onion and cook, stirring, until floppy. Add the tomato sauce and cook for another three minutes, then stir in the capers, olives, currants and nuts. Make a well in the middle of the pan and add the sugar and vinegar, allowing the sugar to dissolve in the heat. Stir and cook for one to two minutes, tasting to see if it needs more sugar or vinegar. Turn off the heat, add the squash and celery, and stir gently, so the squash remains in distinct pieces. Leave to sit for at least two hours or, better still, several, stirring gently once or twice.

The same week, she discovered black mould in her home. \u201cInstead of going on holiday, I decided to move house.\u201d After finding a new flat, she asked a friend if she knew anyone who could help her to move. \u201cShe said she knew someone from Iran but he didn\u2019t speak any English.\u201d Amir had moved to Georgia to buy a home, had bought a van and set up his own moving business. When he arrived to pack up her boxes, she was struck by how attractive he was. \u201cHe was the most handsome man I\u2019d ever seen. I hardly knew where to look,\u201d she says. Because Amir couldn\u2019t speak English, they weren\u2019t able to communicate on the journey. \u201cEven though we couldn\u2019t talk, I thought she seemed smart and pretty,\u201d he says. The next day he texted her to ask her out, using Google Translate to send the message. They went for dinner and used their phones to communicate all evening. \u201cWe talked about our families and the reasons we\u2019d come to live in Georgia,\u201d says Amir. Amy admits she was \u201cbeing cautious\u201d because of the language barrier. \u201cIt kept me from opening up and getting to know him at first.\u201d But when he offered to help her unpack and sort out her new flat the next day, she recognised how kind he was. \u201cThat\u2019s when we were able to get a better feel for each other\u2019s personalities,\u201d she says. \u201cI could tell he was a good person who would do anything for anyone.\u201d A month after they started dating, the government announced that a strict lockdown would soon be coming into force. \u201cJust before everything shut down, I invited him to move in,\u201d she says. She continued to teach online, while Amir\u2019s business was temporarily paused. \u201cI started to teach him some English, but he\u2019s a very stubborn student,\u201d she laughs. It wasn\u2019t long before they began discussing marriage. \u201cI was thinking about it from the start,\u201d says Amir. \u201cShe is so smart and independent. She knew what she wanted from life.\u201d Amy also felt the relationship was right. \u201cHe\u2019s dedicated to me. Even though he couldn\u2019t express these things with words, I saw it through his actions.\u201d\nAt the end of the lockdown, Amir \u201casked me through Google Translate if we could get married\u201d, Amy says. As they were unable to have guests, they held video calls with both families before and after the wedding, which took place at the end of May this year in Georgia. \u201cMy family always trusted my decisions and they were happy for me,\u201d says Amy. Amir also had his family\u2019s blessing. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able to tell my dad anything and he supports me.\u201d The couple enjoy doing everything together, from hiking to yoga. They share a passion for travel and have plans to visit Japan in the future. In September, they moved into Amir\u2019s apartment, just outside the city. They\u2019re now planning to return to Amy\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Virginia. \u201cThe government in Georgia invited people from Iran to live here if they could buy a home for $35,000, but this rule has now changed and the home must be worth over $100,000. It means Amir is no longer eligible for residency, so we\u2019re going back to the States.\u201d Amy loves her partner\u2019s fidelity and commitment to her. \u201cI told him I wanted a pet fish and he bought me this amazing aquarium. He has unquestioning loyalty and will do anything to make me happy. He\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Meanwhile, Amir appreciates his partner\u2019s caring nature. \u201cShe\u2019s always teaching me about the world. I have a better understanding of culture, and she\u2019s opened my mind to new things and new experiences.\u201d Want to share your story?

{"title": "Do not trust Brazil\u2019s \u2018greenwashing\u2019 promises, say Amazon activists", "article": "Amazon forest defenders are urging delegates at Cop26 not to trust the \u201cgreenwashing\u201d promises of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government, which has wreaked havoc on the environment over the past three years. Brazil will field one of the biggest delegations at the UN climate talks in Glasgow and fund a lavish promotional pavilion inside the conference centre. According to the agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina Corr\u00eaa da Costa Dias, and the environment minister, Joaquim Alvaro Pereira Leite, the message is that Brazil is \u201ca longtime champion of the environmental agenda and an agrifood powerhouse\u201d. But climate activists say the world should pay more attention to the destructive policies of the recent past than vague promises about the future, which they say are aimed at securing cash. Suely Vaz, a former head of the environment regulator Ibama who now works for the Climate Observatory, said the Brazilian government had gutted forest protection agencies and tried to change the law in favour of farmers and land grabbers. \u201cNowadays Brazil has an anti-environmental policy. They are paralysing everything. Deforestation and forest fires are out of control. This must change to ensure that climate money \u2013 which is important for our country \u2013 can be used in very detailed, specified way,\u201d she said. Carlos Rittl, a senior policy adviser at the Rainforest Foundation Norway, said Brazil should not get away with a makeover that aimed to shake its pariah reputation under Bolsonaro. \u201cIt will be the biggest team ever. They are spending a lot on communications. Agriculture and industry will be there and a big comms team trying to sell the world a different image. But the world needs to hold Brazil accountable to the truth. The satellites don\u2019t lie.\u201d Satellite images show deforestation is at its highest level since 2012. More than 10,000 square kilometres were lost in the 12 months to July \u2013 an area nearly seven times bigger than greater London, and an increase of 57% on the previous year. Scientists say the rainforest is approaching an irreversible tipping point after which it would degrade into a dry savannah. Every nation is supposed to come to Glasgow with a more ambitious climate plan so the world can move closer to the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of holding global heating as close to 1.5C as possible. The vast majority of governments have promised stronger action, but when Brazil updated its national climate plan last December it weakened its targets and allowed an extra 400 megatonnes of emissions. Climate Action Tracker rated this \u201chighly insufficient\u201d. Brazil has often proved a key player at climate talks and its negotiating team is highly respected. Since Bolsonaro took power, however, the country has become notorious for nationalist, anti-globalist policies. One of its first acts was to abandon plans to host the 2019 Cop. At the subsequent meeting in Madrid, the NGO Climate Action Network presented Brazil with the \u201ccolossal fossil\u201d award for least progressive country. At Glasgow, Brazil will show a less fractious face. This is largely due to the shift in Washington. While Donald Trump was in the White House, Bolsonaro was emboldened to denigrate international cooperation on the world stage. Since Joe Biden came to power, he has been forced to drop his two most globally toxic representatives: the former foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, and the former environment minister Ricardo Salles. The new environment minister, Joaquim Leite, who will head the Brazilian delegation at Glasgow, is far more personable, but activists say he has done little to change the destructive policies of his predecessor. At Biden\u2019s climate summit earlier this year, Bolsonaro promised to meet a goal set by one of his presidential predecessors, Dilma Rousseff, to halt illegal deforestation by 2030. But this threatens to become meaningless because his supporters in Congress are trying to change the law to allow more legal forest clearance and invasions of indigenous land, which is usually the best-protected territory. Inside Brazil, the heat is growing on Bolsonaro, who faces reelection next year. The economy is weak, his ratings are down and the senate wants to try him over the country\u2019s 600,000-plus Covid deaths. Many in the agribusiness sector fear they will lose markets if the president continues to sully the country\u2019s overseas image. Some farmers realise the rainfall for their crops depends on a stable Amazon rainforest. Concessions are possible at Glasgow. Some observers expect Brazil to announce a green growth policy, tweak its national climate plan and compromise on one of the most contentious areas of the climate talks, the \u201carticle 6\u201d debate on a market mechanism for climate action. This could unlock billions of dollars in carbon credits and other incentives. A focus of Brazil\u2019s delegation is the potential market for carbon, methane and conservation credits. These forms of financial support are intended to protect and restore the world\u2019s great forests. This is a key goal of the UK hosts, who hope to announce a deal on Tuesday that would detail measures to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, including greater support for indigenous peoples, moves towards deforestation-free supply chains, finance and regulations. The EU, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have agreed to this deal. Brazil is reportedly yet to sign. Brazil and other developing nations will also be pushing wealthy countries to finally live up to their promise of $100bn a year in climate funding between 2020 and 2025. If approved, the key question is how to ensure the money is spent on projects that reduce emissions and climate impacts. The situation is reminiscent of the US under Trump, when the rest of the world largely ignored the official US delegation at Cop summits while giving prominent space and attention to a rival gatherings of state governors, city mayors, NGOs and others supporting more ambitious emissions cuts. The two very different sides of Brazil will be similarly present in Glasgow. While the official Brazilian pavilion will promote agriculture, a rival Brazil Climate Action hub will highlight the emissions-cutting efforts of Amazonian states, indigenous communities and civil society groups.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/do-not-trust-brazils-greenwashing-promises-say-amazon-activists", "last_update": "2021-10-31T19:49:08Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "First Thing: Poor countries at Cop26 concerned by limited climate progress", "article": "Good morning. Leaders representing more than 1 billion of the people most at risk from the climate crisis have accused the G20 of failing poor and vulnerable countries by not agreeing to a climate plan that would ensure their people\u2019s survival. The leading figures at the Cop26 climate talks told the Guardian they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d and had hoped for more from the G20 summit in Rome. They said the prospect of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a vital threshold that scientists say is a \u201cplanetary boundary\u201d, was slipping away as the UN conference opened in Glasgow. Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which represents 39 countries, said: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen it appears we are going to overshoot 1.5C. We are very concerned about that. This is a matter of survival for us.\u201d He blamed the influence of powerful private-sector interests for the G20\u2019s failure to come up with better plans, saying: \u201cWe are here to save the planet, not to protect profits.\u201d From the seemingly inexorable increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the rapid growth in green energy, here\u2019s the climate crisis explained in 10 charts.

As an environment writer, Fiona Harvey has seen many setbacks \u2013 but also triumphs, such as the tackling of acid rain. Here she shares her optimism for Cop26. Joe Biden dismisses bad polling and says domestic agenda set to pass\nJoe Biden sought to brush off concerns about bad polling on Sunday, telling reporters he expected Democrats to overcome internal differences and pass his domestic spending plan and a bipartisan infrastructure deal in the week to come. Earlier, an NBC News poll found that 54% of US adults disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance, down six points since August, a period in which the president\u2019s domestic agenda has stalled amid intra-party division. Biden spoke to reporters in Rome at the end of the G20, before traveling to Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit. He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t run to determine how well I\u2019m going to do in the polls. I ran to make sure that I follow through on what I said I would do as president of the United States. \u201cI said that I would make sure that we were in a position where we dealt with climate change, where we moved in a direction that would significantly improve the prospects of American workers having good jobs and good pay. And further that I would make sure that we dealt with the crisis that was caused by Covid. \u201cI believe we will pass my Build Back Better plan. I believe we will pass the infrastructure bill.\u201d Top Democrats reportedly want a final version of Biden\u2019s $1.75tn spending plan drafted by Sunday and passed by Tuesday. The price tag has come down dramatically from $3.5tn, with concessions to senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. The infrastructure deal is valued at $1tn. In a 50-50 Senate, and with no Republican support on spending, Manchin and Sinema are key. Democrats must use reconciliation, a way to pass budgetary initiatives via a simple majority rather than 60 votes. Jen Psaki, White House press secretary to Joe Biden, tests positive for Covid\nJen Psaki, Joe Biden\u2019s White House press secretary, said on Sunday she had tested positive for Covid-19. Psaki, 42, did not travel with Biden to Rome for this week\u2019s G20 summit. Biden has been accompanied in Europe by his principal deputy press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. The news of a positive test for a close aide to the president came a little over a year after an outbreak at the White House reached the then president, Donald Trump, who fell seriously ill and was forced to spend time in hospital. In a statement, Psaki said she last saw the 78-year-old Biden on Tuesday, \u201cwhen we sat outside more than 6ft apart and wore masks\u201d. Biden tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday, Reuters quoted \u201ca person familiar with the matter\u201d as saying. Why didn\u2019t she travel to Europe for the G20 and Cop25 talks? Psaki said she stayed in the US \u201cdue to a family emergency, which was members of my household testing positive for Covid-19\u201d. Has Biden had a booster shot of the Covid vaccine? Yes, the president got his Covid-19 booster on 27 September, shortly after federal regulators approved the third dose for many Americans.

{"title": "Woman has four-year wait to see Northern Ireland neurologist", "article": "A single mother of six children has been waiting four years and four months to see a consultant for suspected multiple sclerosis in Northern Ireland as officials admit in leaked court papers that health waiting lists have spiralled \u201cout of control\u201d. Although referred to a neurologist in June 2017, Eileen Wilson, 47, has still not received a date to see the specialist despite suffering choking episodes that leave her \u201cblue in the face\u201d, loss of muscle control and a multitude of other symptoms. She is one of the hundreds of thousands of patients suffering in silence because of the chronic waiting lists that have been building since 2013, according to testimony submitted to the high court. Her case is at the centre of two landmark cases to be heard in December and January against the Northern Ireland health minister, Robin Swann, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the health secretary, Savid Javid, who were named as defendants in the case last week after affidavits from Northern Ireland\u2019s Department of Health blamed years of underfunding for the crisis. Sitting in her garden in her army veteran house in Belfast, Wilson said she would not give up the fight even though the human rights commission, her GP, and her MP, Gavin Robinson, have all failed to get her an appointment. \u201cI just want to know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she says. She explains how she staggers around her home \u201clike a drunk\u201d even though she does not drink and now suffers episodes of sleep paralysis, which has been likened to locked-in syndrome.\n\u201cWhen I go to bed all the worry is there, it\u2019s like a washing machine on full spin,\u201d she said. \u201cI worry that if I fall or choke, that\u2019s going to be the end of it.\u201d Die? \u201cYes,\u201d she answers. \u201cIt can happen anytime. It\u2019s like something is stuck in my throat. I\u2019ve gone blue in the face. It lasts for a few minutes but it feels like hours,\u201d she said. To her shock, she heard through her MP that her GP\u2019s referral had been downgraded from \u201curgent\u201d to \u201croutine\u201d, with the chief executive of South Eastern health and social care trust telling Robinson that \u201cregrettably\u201d the waiting time for an appointment was 163 weeks \u2013 three years and 13 weeks. \u201cI am very sorry that we have not yet been able to offer Mrs Wilson an appointment,\u201d he said. Four years and four months later, she is none the wiser. Her solicitor, Ciaran O\u2019Hare of McIvor Farrell, has already applied successfully for leave for a judicial review, which is now listed for January with a second case expedited for hearing in December over a failed bid to get her an appointment overseas under EU legislation transposed into domestic law. He said her case was for the \u201cbenefit of the people of Northern Ireland\u201d and is asking the court to conclude that the waiting lists, the worst in the UK for much of the past decade, are \u201cunlawful and a breach of human rights\u201d. \u201cThis saga has been going on in Northern Ireland for over 10 years and hospital waiting lists have been getting longer and longer. We do not have the NHS here, like in England; we have health and social care and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said O\u2019Hare. \u201cThis is the first case of its kind and it is absolutely crucial because something must be done to end the suffering that is occurring every single day with people languishing and dying on hospital waiting lists,\u201d he added. Recent figures show nearly a fifth of Northern Ireland\u2019s population are waiting for a first appointment and more than half of those are waiting for more than a year. \u201cIt is the case that the majority of people on the waiting list are waiting for more than a year, which is pretty extraordinary,\u201d said Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the health services thinktank the Nuffield Trust. Waiting lists are the worst in the UK and possibly in Europe. Last week, the children\u2019s commissioner revealed that 24 children with confirmed or suspected cancer were among the 17,000 minors waiting more than a year to see a specialist. Affidavits submitted to the courts and seen by the Guardian paint a grim picture. A senior official in the Department of Health in his testimony, said the delays were \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d but the health minister had repeatedly said a significant increase in funding was necessary to make a return to acceptable levels. \u201cWhile doctors, nurses, other health professionals and managers have made every effort to ensure that any negative impact on patients has been kept to a minimum, waiting times have continued to grow to a level where many believe that they are now out of control,\u201d he added. Dayan said Northern Ireland\u2019s waiting lists began to \u201cspiral to more and more unacceptably poor levels relative to the rest of the UK\u201d 10 years ago. He said \u201cone year-plus waits\u201d were \u201calmost unheard of\u201d in England before Covid, but have been \u201ccommon in Northern Ireland\u201d. Out of an estimated 460,000 on a waiting list, 250,000 have been on it for more than a year, he said.

{"title": "\u2018My radar wasn\u2019t going off\u2019: Gladys Berejiklian tells Icac she didn\u2019t see or hear any corruption to speak of", "article": "When Daryl Maguire phoned Gladys Berejiklian in 2018 to tell her he\u2019d been summonsed to the Independent Commission Against Corruption did she realise that what she did next might cost her her career? Did the former New South Wales premier consider that she might have information gleaned from their five-year secret relationship that she, as a public official, had a duty to report? Apparently not. On Monday Berejiklian faced serious questions about whether she met her obligations the Icac Act to report \u201ca reasonable suspicion of corrupt conduct\u201d to either Icac or the head of her department of Premier and cabinet. She did not contact either, a decision that, depending on what the commission finds she knew about Maguire\u2019s alleged dealings, could lead to a finding of a serious breach.\nIcac guidelines explain reasonable suspicion means \u201cthere is a real possibility that corrupt conduct is, or may be, involved. No proof is required.\u201d We\u2019ve already heard tapped phone calls of Maguire telling Berejiklian he hoped to make $1.5m in commissions out of securing property rezonings at the new airport site at Badergy\u2019s creek. This was while he was a serving MP in an electorate 400km from Sydney\u2019s new airport site. Berejiklian has given evidence this sum did not ring alarm bells for her. She told Icac she didn\u2019t really believe him. But she was told more than that, as we learned from phone taps played to the commission on Friday. On the evening of 5 July 2018 the former MP for Wagga rang with a bombshell: he had been summonsed as a witness to Icac over an introduction he had made for a Chinese developer, Country Garden, to then mayor of Canterbury, Michael Hawatt. An increasingly alarmed Berejiklian spent the 52-minute call trying to untangle exactly what Maguire was being called to Icac for. He told her Icac was interested in an introduction he had made for Country Garden to a council 400kms from his own electorate. She commented that the people he was associating with were \u201cdodgy\u201d. He assured her he was just a witness. He railed against Icac and said they could be listening now. They were. Monday morning brought further grilling by counsel assisting Scott Robertson SC about Berejiklian\u2019s state of mind and her suspicions after that call.\nBerejiklian gave evidence she didn\u2019t put two and two together with anything she had heard over the last three or four years. She did not \u201cjoin the dots\u201d about what had been revealed to her privately about lobbying for rezonings of land at Badgery\u2019s creek and the Icac probe. She did not suspect corrupt conduct. \u201cI assumed he had been caught up in something,\u201d she said. Even after the 5 July call, she didn\u2019t think she needed to inform Icac what Maguire had just told her because \u201cIcac already knew\u201d. As commissioner, Ruth McColl pointed out, she didn\u2019t know what Icac knew or didn\u2019t know. Still she didn\u2019t suspect any corrupt conduct. \u201cMy radar wasn\u2019t going off,\u201d she said. \u201cI trusted him.\u201d The commission heard that in the days after 5 July, there were texts and calls in which Maguire urged Berejiklian to get another private phone and to communicate using the WeChat app, so that Icac couldn\u2019t read or hear their communications. She suggested WhatsApp might be easier and said she would try. She did not take up his advice, and said that she believed his requests were because of \u201cprivacy concerns,\u201d rather than trying to avoid detection. On 13 July Maguire appeared before Icac in Operation Dacha and the full extent of his involvement with Canterbury council became public. That inquiry was played phone taps of Maguire discussing his plans with business associates to seek payment for brokering property deals. The inquiry ultimately made no finding of corrupt conduct against him, but recommended he face criminal charges for giving false evidence. That evening Berejiklian phoned her chief of staff, Sarah Cruiksank whom she described as \u201ca close friend\u201d and highly professional public servant, to tell her about the secret relationship with Maguire. Cruikshank has given evidence that she was at dinner when the call came and did not take notes but she recalled Berejiklian telling her the relationship was \u201chistorical\u201d and had ended when she became premier in January 2017.\nUnder questioning Cruikshank\u2019s counsel on Monday, Berejiklian denied she had lied about its status to Cruikshank. \u201cTwo people could have different perceptions of the same conversation,\u201d she said. Of course, a current relationship would have had very different political ramifications. Cruikshank, had she known the relationship was ongoing, would have no doubt swung into full damage control, telling Icac that if she had known the relationship was ongoing she would have discussed with Berejiklian \u201cwhether or not there were implications for things she had done\u201d and told Maguire that Berejiklian should not be involved in decisions relating to proposals he was lobbying for. The motivation behind Berejiklian\u2019s obsessive secrecy about the relationship with Maguire is difficult to fathom. After his evidence at Icac, she removed him from the ministry and sent him to the crossbenches, as is protocol. But she made some poor choices. She did not seek any advice from Cruikshank or a lawyer on whether she had a duty to report what she knew to Icac, maintaining that she didn\u2019t have any suspicions. In fact she kept in contact with him until September 2020. She told Icac that she was \u201cmortified\u201d after he gave evidence, saying the \u201cshock of what happened made me question everything\u201d including whether Maguire might have lied to her.\nMeanwhile, at least two staff members came forward in the days after Maguire\u2019s evidence, to tell the head of the Premier\u2019s department they needed to go to Icac to report what they knew about Maguire. One of them was an adviser to the minister for trade and industry. The other had worked as an adviser to the minister for planning. We do not know what they told Icac but the fact they had made disclosures was noted in two memos to the premier\u2019s office which were tendered at the commission. Berejiklian saw at least one of these, noting on it: \u201cthe secretary\u2019s role in this should be replicated for all future declarations.\u201d Still Berejiklian did not see the need to report anything to Icac herself. Under intense questioning from Robertson, Berejiklian said she was \u201calive to her obligations\u201d and that she had asked herself over and over whether she knew anything that should be reported to Icac. She was not motiviated by a fear that the relationship would become public, and \u201cNo. Gosh,\u201d she was not affected by her personal feelings toward him. She just didn\u2019t suspect anything.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/my-radar-wasnt-going-off-gladys-berejiklian-tells-icac-she-didnt-see-or-hear-any-corruption-to-speak-of", "last_update": "2021-11-01T10:43:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "UK\u2019s largest purpose-built village for rough sleepers planned in Manchester", "article": "Plans are under way to build the UK\u2019s largest village for rough sleepers in one of Manchester\u2019s most desirable neighbourhoods. Embassy Village will provide homes for 40 men in purpose-built pods underneath 10 railway arches in the Castlefield district, where one-bedroom flats regularly sell for \u00a3250,000. Sandwiched between the River Irwell and the Bridgewater canal, the land has been given for free on a 125-year lease by Peel Group, the developers behind MediaCity and the Manchester Ship Canal. The village is the brainchild of Sid Williams, founder of a Christian charity called Embassy. A skinny-jeaned, perma-cheerful enthusiast, he ran a homeless shelter on Mumford & Sons\u2019 old tour bus until Covid got in the way. James Whittaker, Peel\u2019s executive director of development, calls him Jesus, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t help but feel the genuine good he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s probably the kindest, most genuine man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nThough he would blush at the blasphemous comparison, 36-year-old Williams has a remarkable knack for getting rich people to dig into their pockets in his mission to house the homeless and destitute in Manchester. An estate agent would describe Embassy Village as \u201cwaterside living in a city centre location\u201d. Showing the Guardian around the site last month, Williams admitted it currently looks more like \u201can apocalyptic wasteland\u201d, with water dripping from two viaducts carrying noisy trams and trains and some rough sleepers having already set up mattresses among the detritus of illegal raves. Planning permission was granted this summer, with 61% of local people in favour of the project. Now Williams \u2013 helped by Tim Heatley, founder of property developer Capital & Centric and chair of the Greater Manchester mayor\u2019s homelessness charity \u2013 is on a mission to raise \u00a33m to build the village, offering local corporates a chance to sponsor one or more homes. Computer-generated simulations of the project show alfresco dining, festoon lighting and imaginary residents tending to communal gardens \u2013 exactly the sort of aspirational images sold to wealthy young professionals moving into the skyscrapers popping up across Manchester. But while they may pay \u00a3800 a month for a one-bed studio, Embassy\u2019s residents are likely to pay no more than the local housing allowance \u2013 currently \u00a3302 a month for a room in a shared house or \u00a3552 for a one-bed flat. Embassy is not providing \u201cforever\u201d homes. Residents can stay for a maximum of two years. The idea is to \u201cgive every resident a live trial run at managing a home, cooking, cleaning and paying rent in a sympathetic and supported environment\u201d, said Williams.\nRunning the Embassy bus led Williams to conclude that shelters are not really the answer to solving rough sleeping. If people are to get off the streets, they need stable tenancies and wrap-around support. They also need jobs, which is why Embassy partners with 18 local businesses who agree to give interviews and hopefully employment to its tenants. To qualify for residency in Embassy Village, residents must be men with no alcohol or drug addictions. (Embassy will soon open a separate, more low-key project for homeless women fleeing domestic violence.) As well as paying rent, they must commit to six hours a week of training in shopping, cooking and budgeting. \u201cI wanted to get away from the shelter model where you sort of accidentally become a parent, going, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do the shopping. And I\u2019ll do the cleaning. And I\u2019ll do the cooking,\u2019\u201d said Williams. The preconception that most homeless people are addicts is not true, said Williams: \u201cSixty per cent of our chaps are homeless because of relationship breakdowns.\u201d During the pandemic, Embassy rented properties to move men from the tour bus into homes, including one who had spent seven years in shelters waiting for a council house. With about 13,000 households on the waiting list in Manchester, he never got to the top as a \u201csingle bloke with no criminal record, no addictions and no real mental health struggles\u201d, said Williams.\nPotential residents will be referred by Manchester city council or local homeless charities and then interviewed by Embassy. \u201cThe interview is really to ascertain whether you\u2019re serious about change,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBelieve it or not, about half the people we interview say, \u2018I don\u2019t want a job, I don\u2019t ever want to work, I want to live in a council flat. That\u2019s my ambition.\u2019 And we go, \u2018That\u2019s great. But we are not that thing.\u2019\u201d Smaller homeless villages have been built in recent years in Bristol and Edinburgh, and the Hope Gardens development in Ealing, west London, has 60 apartments in containers used as emergency accommodation in 20ft containers for the newly homeless. What makes Embassy different is the ambition to build a community. Central to this is a village hall, complete with counselling room, laundry and communal computers, plus a training kitchen to help residents learn to cook, said Williams: \u201cThat way we can be a community, we watch England lose at the football, we can celebrate people\u2019s birthdays, and Christmas dinner \u2013 all that good stuff.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/01/uks-largest-purpose-built-village-rough-sleepers-planned-manchester-embassy-village", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:13:42Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Great Resignation has employers sweating. It\u2019s time to escalate the pressure | Erika Rodriguez", "article": "Despite quizzical think pieces on the motivations behind the Great Resignation, anyone who pays rent or a mortgage knows why this \u201clabor shortage\u201d is under way. After years of inflation and stagnant wages, the pandemic has revealed the value of labor, the worthlessness of commutes and office culture, and the importance of finding personal comfort in times of increasing precarity.\nIn other words, we are living in what labor economist Lawrence Katz calls \u201ca once-in-a-generation \u2018take this job and shove it\u2019 moment\u201d \u2013 which gives workers a once-in-a-generation upper hand. The potential of this cultural moment is not limited to the 2.9% of the workforce who have quit their jobs in the past few months. As CEOs scramble to maintain retention rates, those who have kept their jobs can express solidarity with resigning workers and contribute to the cultural shift by slowing the pace of productivity. What I am proposing is not exactly a \u201cslowdown\u201d, but a \u201cslow-up\u201d. Traditionally, a slowdown is a strike tactic in which workers remain on the job but slow productivity with the aim of negotiating for a particular objective, such as higher wages. In this sense, a slowdown is a highly localized and temporary effort. By contrast, a slow-up must be unlocalized and permanent. It would entail a grassroots redefinition of workplace expectations \u2013 and frankly, it has been a long time coming. In 2020, 80% of US workers reported feeling that they have too many things to do and not enough time to do them \u2013 a phenomenon known as time poverty. This isn\u2019t just in our heads: a 2014 Gallup poll revealed that US workers clocked in an average of 47 hours a week, with more than 18% working over 60 hours a week. It would be naive to attribute these statistics to the industrious spirit of the American worker, considering that full-time minimum wage workers cannot afford an apartment in any state in the US without taking on another job.\nIt is no surprise that \u201cspeed up\u201d and \u201cslow down\u201d evidence a cultural recognition that a fast pace moves you up the corporate ladder, while a slower pace leaves you behind. Instead, a slow up (intentionally rhymes with \u201cglow up\u201d) signals that slowing down can improve workers\u2019 quality of life. The objective is not to drive down profits (though that may happen), but to uphold the ideal that everyone deserves a life of dignity, which includes rest and distance from work. Undoubtedly, some will say that calling for a slow-up ignores the lived realities of workers or the racialized and gendered dynamics of the workplace, where people of color still have to work twice as hard to be recognized and women are still expected to do unpaid work. While such criticism is valuable, it also reaffirms the expectation that living a worthwhile life or getting a human amount of rest is a luxury afforded only to the privileged. Moreover, such a critique intentionally ignores the work of Black activists and artists who explicitly call for a change in work rhythms. A 2019 art installation by Navild Acosta and Fannie Sosa, Black Power Naps/Siestas Negras, responds to the fact that 34% of Hispanics and 45% of Black US residents get less than seven hours of sleep a night. Similarly, Tricia Hersey, a performance artist known as the Nap Bishop, has convincingly argued since 2016 that rest is a necessary component of reparations. So, while it is true that groups who bear the brunt of workplace disparities would be taking the biggest risks in a slow-up, it is also true that we would have the most to gain. We would be, effectively, stealing back our lives. Although a slow-up is not a strike tactic, it does elicit many of the same concerns of a \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d as workers\u2019 strikes. Because our economic structure puts workers in continuous competition with each other, a worker who slows the pace could lose an opportunity, a promotion, or employment itself. The slow-up requires solidarity, flexibility and creativity. Depending on the job and the worker, slowing up might mean responding to emails only three days a week, blocking out time for yourself before and after draining meetings, taking unofficial breaks, following work expectations to the letter of a company\u2019s mission statement, or strategically engaging in untrackable forms of \u201ctime theft\u201d. Attending to a slower pace can also help us be vigilant against corporate attempts to rebrand fast-paced exploitation. CEOs are scrambling to create a \u201cnew normal\u201d that mollifies workers\u2019 desire for work-life balance while keeping existing power structures in play. While more than 70% of CEOs expect that the labor shortage will disrupt their business in the next 12 months, two of the main solutions they are implementing across the board \u2013 more flexible hours and increased diversity \u2013 fall short of the policy changes workers need, such as increased holidays and paid time off. It is not that flexible schedules or emphasis on diversity and inclusion are bad for workers, but rather that both of these retention strategies are easily subsumed into the traditional rat race.\nStudies already show that more flexible hours lead to more work hours \u2013 specifically, 2.5 more hours of work a day. This is not to say that flexible hours cannot be beneficial, but that workers should preemptively find ways of slowing up to make the most of their new work dynamic. Similarly, corporate-driven diversity efforts very quickly hit the limits of their potential, particularly given that most begin and end with \u201cwe should see more diversity in our employee base and \u2026 our leadership\u201d. In the spirit of slow-up, we could ask: What would it mean, instead, if diversity, equity, and inclusion practices were worker-led and intended to explore labor practices that can grapple with rest as a necessary part of reparations and closing the sleep gap? What if inclusion examined the relationships that emerge from labor organizing? Or if \u201cequity\u201d (defined as fairness and justice in the way people are treated) responded to the many reports highlighting that the US remains an outlier in overwork? As with any labor movement, the Great Resignation is a waiting game. The longer workers remain between jobs, the more their expenses go up \u2013 an important advantage to employers. Keeping those who quit their job afloat through mutual aid and pushing for generous paid time off and parental leave during this crucial time of workplace redefinition is also in the interest of our collective wellbeing. Does this seem impossible? The truth is, you don\u2019t have to be idealistic to participate in the slow-up. You only have to be imaginative. You only have to think about the meaningful things that could fill your day and imagine what it would feel like to work more slowly and feel more rested \u2013 and then strategically act as though that were already possible. In the words of Courtney Desiree Morris: \u201cWhat if we attempted to live as free as the many-gendered daughters that are yet meant to arrive but we know are coming?\u201d Erika Rodriguez is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maine at Farmington and the director of the New Commons Project", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/01/great-resignation-employers-sweating-time-to-escalate-pressure", "last_update": "2021-10-29T19:31:37Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Emotional infidelity: the devastating, destructive love affairs that involve no sex at all", "article": "Chloe had encouraged her husband to accept the new job. \u201cI told him: \u2018Life is too short to be unhappy.\u2019\u201d The effect on him was transformative \u2013 but not in the way she had imagined. \u201cOne minute, he was a family guy, the next, he was always working late and going in early.\u201d She found out why when she visited him one day at work. \u201cMy heart dropped when I saw them talking to each other \u2013 they had this closeness,\u201d says Chloe, 49. \u201cI realised then that it was her that had come between us. He went to her with problems, shared secrets and aspirations \u2013 all those things that we used to do together.\u201d Chloe is confident the relationship was never physical \u2013 but 15 years later it is still enormously hurtful. At the time, they had been married for 12 years and had a three-year-old son. \u201cBefore, I thought that pain could only come from a physical betrayal \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a rulebook to follow for this type.\u201d *** An emotional affair is characterised by nonsexual intimacy with someone other than your partner, in such a way that violates their trust and expectations. With technology enabling round-the-clock and covert communication, it has never been easier to fall into that grey area between \u201cjust friends\u201d and \u201cmore than friends\u201d \u2013 often with plausible deniability. According to a 2015 YouGov study of 1,660 British adults, 20% of people have been unfaithful to their partner. Of those, 15% said their infidelity had no physical component. When the Guardian ran a reader callout asking for experiences of emotional affairs, the responses showed that the fallout of this kind of affair is no less devastating for the lack of sex. Chloe says she could feel her husband\u2019s relationship with his colleague \u201ceroding\u201d her own, but \u201cit was so easy to duck out of discussing it because nothing had physically happened\u201d. Then she looked at her husband\u2019s phone: \u201cHis messages to her had their own kind of language and intimacy \u2013 I knew then that we wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Not every relationship would be threatened by such a bond: only 44% of respondents to the YouGov survey said they considered a non-physical connection to be cheating. Some people actively make room for others through consensual non-monogamy. Albert, a retiree who identifies as queer, says an \u201cemotional affair\u201d strikes him as a non-sequitur: \u201cIt equates the attachment with something that is duplicitous \u2013 this need not be the case.\u201d\nJealousy over friends or colleagues might also denote a relationship that is controlling or even abusive. But in instances where those suspicions are well founded, the truth may emerge only after many painful arguments, denial and even gaslighting. Confirmation of her ex-partner\u2019s emotional affair made Anneka, 31, feel strangely relieved: \u201cI felt vindicated that I had been right. I\u2019d spent a long time questioning whether I was just being crazy and controlling.\u201d Anneka\u2019s paranoia had been piqued by her then boyfriend being \u201cglued to his phone\u201d, while keeping it out of her sight. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident he wasn\u2019t cheating on me physically \u2013 but, in my mind, emotional cheating is almost as bad.\u201d What constitutes infidelity is specific to each relationship, says Sarah Calvert, a sex and relationships therapist based in London, but secrecy can be proof enough. \u201cThat is one of the factors \u2013 telling secrets and deep, intimate feelings that you wouldn\u2019t want your partner to know you were sharing. It comes down to that basic question: would you be happy for your partner to be overhearing these conversations, or to know how much time you spend thinking about them?\u201d Georgina, 40, says her three-year emotional affair with a colleague was \u201cas intense as a physical affair \u2013 perhaps more so. We never even kissed on the mouth. I had never felt closer to anyone.\u201d Dr Gayle Brewer, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Liverpool, says that if our partner is confiding in someone else instead of us, perhaps with intimate details about our relationship, \u201cwe tend to view that as a betrayal\u201d. Conversely, \u201cif we feel as if our partner is not listening to us or supporting us, we\u2019re more likely to engage in emotional infidelity,\u201d she says (although a strong support network outside the relationship could mitigate this).\nThe impact is felt more by women, says Brewer, with studies showing \u201ctime and time again\u201d that they are more distressed by an emotional affair than by a sexual one, while the opposite is true for men. \u201cMen tend to question their partners: \u2018Have you had sex with that person?\u2019 Women tend to ask: \u2018Do you love that person?\u2019 And the unfaithful partner will deny the aspect that\u2019s more hurtful.\u201d Daphne, 25, broke up with her boyfriend over his messages to a former colleague: \u201cThey were chatting like boyfriend and girlfriend. It hurt more than if he had drunkenly snogged someone on a night out.\u201d When they got back together a year later, her boyfriend struggled with Daphne\u2019s sexual encounters during the break. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really have the right to say anything about it,\u201d she says. The common conception is that an emotional affair is a precursor to a physical one. \u201cA little bit of chemistry or sexual tension\u201d is typical of emotional affairs, says Calvert, but their underlying cause \u2013 the behaviours driving the betrayal \u2013 may not be obvious. \u201cIn my experience, it comes from deeper issues within the relationship or the person \u2013 unresolved issues from past traumas, for example, or a need that\u2019s not being met.\u201d Walter, a middle-aged father of three, paraphrases When Harry Met Sally: \u201cAffairs are a symptom, not a cause.\u201d His wife\u2019s emotional affair, with a female friend, had roots in her sexual confusion and childhood abuse, he says. \u201cI can\u2019t judge her from an intellectual perspective. But I can say that when your lover gives her heart to someone else, it\u2019s simply painful.\u201d\nOther readers linked their (or their partner\u2019s) emotional affair to a wide range of factors including religious upbringing, difficulties in conceiving, new parenthood, mental and physical illness, the death of a parent, professional impostor syndrome, and the disruption to a social network caused by a change in job or location. One 29-year-old described feelings of panic at a looming engagement: \u201cI couldn\u2019t explain why \u2013 I had spent the past six years dreaming of our future. But a birthday message from an ex-lover popped up in my inbox and the rest unfolded at a rapid pace.\u201d Much more pronounced than doubts about the relationship was the toll taken on them by day-to-day responsibilities, especially after many years of monogamy. \u201cThe emotional high we both got from a feeling of being recognised as people \u2013 not parents, colleagues, spouses, whatever \u2013 was addictive,\u201d says Yvonne, 47, who had an emotional affair with her colleague. Clara, 24, echoed many respondents in describing a man she met via an app, with whom she talked nonstop for four months: \u201cHe was everything I wanted my partner to be.\u201d When the third party is often idealised, it is not a fair comparison, says Calvert. \u201cIt\u2019s like this big fantasy is created \u2013 they seem to understand you, but actually you\u2019re not seeing the whole of them, because you don\u2019t have a full relationship.\u201d Confronting what is at the root of your emotional affair could reveal the path out of it \u2013 and strengthen your relationship, she adds. \u201cJust like physical affairs, emotional affairs give an opportunity to look at the underlying issues, whether that\u2019s within the individual or the relationship. It can be a catalyst for quite a seismic change \u2013 but re-establishing trust takes a long time.\u201d Phyllis, 58, and her husband are opening up their 20-year marriage to polyamory after admitting to emotional affairs: \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up the person I\u2019m having an emotional affair with, but I am willing to repair what is broken in my marriage,\u201d she says. Caitlin, 37, says her husband\u2019s emotional entanglement with a colleague has \u201cbeen a real kick up the arse for us\u201d. At the time, they had been working long hours and raising young children, with little joy in their lives or time for each other. After the affair came out, they relocated, resolving to make a change. Now their marriage is \u201cbetter than ever\u201d, says Caitlin. \u201cWe remember we do actually like and love each other, and we feel good that we\u2019ve gone through so much together \u2026 it just as easily could have been me who had had an emotional affair; things were that bad. We\u2019re grateful that it happened now.\u201d Even if a relationship does not recover, there is more to be gained from confronting the problems at play, says Calvert. Through therapy, Walter found the self-esteem he needed to end his marriage after his wife\u2019s emotional affair. India, 28, says she is much happier after hers led to a divorce. Likewise, Tanya, 30, says it was a catalyst to end her 10-year relationship: \u201cI\u2019m thoroughly enjoying the independence and growth.\u201d As for Chloe, her husband\u2019s emotional affair led to their divorce. \u201cI slowly rebuilt myself by going to [the counselling service] Relate to \u2018get over it\u2019 \u2013 and him.\u201d And she did, later remarrying and having another child. She says her husband\u2019s emotional affair was the making of \u201cthe more savvy me. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without it.\u201d Some names have been changed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/01/emotional-infidelity-the-devastating-destructive-love-affairs-that-involve-no-sex-at-all", "last_update": "2021-10-29T17:27:32Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Players want Fifa vice-president suspended after Guardian investigation", "article": "Former Vancouver Whitecaps women\u2019s team players fear a proposed investigation by Major League Soccer into the club\u2019s response to allegations of sexual misconduct will be a whitewash and fail to adequately address multiple instances of wrongdoing. The players, who represented Vancouver Whitecaps in the 2008 and 2011 seasons, are supported by Canada\u2019s Professional Footballers Association (PFACan) in a call for key club executives to be fired. It is understood the players this week will also demand Concacaf suspends its president, Victor Montagliani, until an independent investigation is completed into events surrounding Canada Soccer\u2019s failure to deal with separate allegations against former Whitecaps coach Bob Birarda in 2008. Birarda was head coach of Canada\u2019s under-20 women\u2019s national team and the Whitecaps women\u2019s team while Montagliani was director of national teams. Montagliani also serves as a Fifa vice-president. At the time, an internal investigation into Birarda\u2019s behavior resulted in Canada Soccer and Whitecaps stating the coach had left his roles by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d, yet he continued to coach girls\u2019 youth soccer. In 2019, Montagliani told the Guardian he had taken the allegations against Birarda seriously. \u201cAbsolutely the allegations were treated seriously,\u201d Montagliani said. \u201cThe federation was notified through our general secretariat. Our staff was dispatched to meet with this ombudsman. There were a couple of days of discussions and interviews and after that it was deemed that this coach was no longer with our program. He was not an employee of the federation. We would just pay him a per diem as he was coaching. He parted ways with our program and the Whitecaps followed suit in parting ways with him as well. I never saw the report but the information that was given to the board [was sufficient].\u201d Birarda was arrested in December 2020 and faces six counts of sexual exploitation, two counts of sexual assault and one count of child luring, involving allegations spanning 20 years from 1988 to 2008. He is out on bail and has yet to enter a plea.\n\u201cI welcome the interest of Major League Soccer in these issues but we don\u2019t need MLS to be in charge of this investigation,\u201d said Malloree Enoch. In a Guardian investigation published last week, Enoch alleged her former coach Hubert Busby Jr attempted to pressure her for sex during a recruitment process spanning 2010 and 2011. Busby denies the allegations. After the Guardian reported the allegations last week, MLS said it intended to launch an investigation. \u201cMLS will only look after its own interests,\u201d Enoch said. \u201cWe need to see a thorough investigation.\u201d The former Whitecaps players are expected to release a statement in the next 48 hours supported by PFACan that will include a demand that any Whitecaps or Canada Soccer executive involved in the departures of Birarda and Busby, but who chose to misrepresent the reasons behind their exits, be fired. \u201cThese executives have lost their ability to continue in a leadership position,\u201d Paul Champ, legal counsel to PFACan, told the Guardian. The players will also call for Concacaf and Fifa to suspend Montagliani from his roles until an independent investigation into the 2008 events is completed. That issue centers on Birarda being allowed to coach in the local community after allegations of sexual misconduct were known by Canada Soccer. \u201cWe are happy we can carry this burden for the players,\u201d Champ said of the union\u2019s support. \u201cThere is already some reflection going on at Canada Soccer and we would like to continue to push them to consider these issues. All of these issues are connected and we need to know what the governing bodies are doing about it.\u201d The Whitecaps organization has been in crisis since the Guardian last week revealed the allegations by Enoch. Chief executive officer Axel Schuster called Enoch on Friday night to apologize for the club\u2019s failure to act at the time of the alleged incidents. After local journalists camped outside the club\u2019s headquarters on Friday hoping to speak with officials about the allegations, Schuster released a statement claiming unnamed executives had been placed on leave. Still, the club has yet to respond to questions from the Guardian sent to chief operating officer Rachel Lewis on 19 October. Lewis, along with current management executives Dan Lenarduzzi, Greg Anderson, and Bob Lenarduzzi are longtime executives at the club and were aware of the allegations against Birarda and Busby at the time they were made. Dan Lenarduzzi, a Whitecaps club vice-president, emailed members of the women\u2019s team in 2011 after Busby\u2019s departure from the club instructing them to not comment publicly on his exit. The club did not mention the allegations when Busby left the Whitecaps, instead saying it was in \u201cthe club\u2019s best interest to make a change in coaching staff for our women\u2019s team program\u201d. Busby told the Guardian that allegations of misconduct were never discussed when his contract was being negotiated at the end of the 2011 season. Busby, the head coach of the Jamaica women\u2019s national team, is scheduled to meet with the Jamaican Football Federation on Tuesday to discuss the allegations around his time with the Whitecaps. Issues with how Whitecaps executives have dealt with abuse claims have not been limited to the women\u2019s teams. In 2017, the mother of a Vancouver Whitecaps male youth team player who was allegedly sexually assaulted by his teammates claimed the club discouraged the boy and his family from immediately reporting the incident to police. The mother of the player \u2013 a minor at the time of the incident \u2013 told local media the MLS club provided her with two options to address the issue: hire either a private investigator or a moonlighting police officer who had previously provided the club with matchday security to look into the allegations. \u201cOur gut instinct was that they were trying to downplay it and protect themselves,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWe felt that they wanted to deal with it internally and not let it get out.\u201d The assault involved the player being pinned to the ground inside the team\u2019s training-ground locker room before what was described as \u201ca graphic sex assault\u201d. \u201cThese were his teammates,\u201d the player\u2019s mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing to think that this even happened.\u201d Police eventually charged two players with sexual assault after the mother called the police. It is unclear whether the Whitecaps reported the incident to the police. \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of our players is our top priority and we have been cooperating fully with the [police] investigation,\u201d the Whitecaps said at the time.

{"title": "The Bonfire review \u2013 distinctive icy parable of guilt and remorse", "article": "Dmitry Davydov is the self-taught Russian director from the remote eastern republic of Sakha who has been gaining golden opinions on the festival circuit for his spare and fervent films, often using non-professional actors. Here is Davydov\u2019s first feature, The Bonfire, from 2016, which is intriguing, if sometimes baffling in its stylistic variations. Mostly it has the uncompromising austerity of a stripped-down social realist drama. And yet occasionally it gives you quite a lot of frills. Intermittently, we get a rich orchestral score that feels as if it comes from another type of film altogether; there\u2019s a \u201cmontage\u201d sequence of an old man and a young kid getting to know each other that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Hollywood feature, and a late-breaking marriage subplot that is certainly startling. An old man, Ignat (Alexey Ustinov) living alone in this remote and freezing territory, is horrified when his grownup son takes his own life in a fit of remorse for accidentally killing someone while drunk. Ignat finds a kind of redemption in looking after a local kid whose mum is an alcoholic, but the ageing father of the boy his son killed is in no way chastened or mollified by the suicide of his son\u2019s killer. He can\u2019t forgive or forget and is consumed with the desire to kill Ignat.\nThe Bonfire has the simplicity of a parable (when it isn\u2019t periodically assuming the style of something with a higher budget) and it is always absorbing, despite or because of the eccentricities: there\u2019s a scene which is shot from Ignat\u2019s point-of-view for no very obvious reason. Ustinov shows us a real anguish and a real dignity and his stoicism governs the tone of the film itself. It\u2019s a movie with a tough and flinty solidity. \u2022 The Bonfire is available on 4 November on Klassiki.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/01/the-bonfire-review-distinctive-icy-parable-of-guilt-and-remorse", "last_update": "2021-11-01T09:31:07Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The ex-fitness trainers creating a Black-owned ranch: \u2018We need a new system\u2019", "article": "On the eastern edge of the Sonoran desert, in the grasslands not 10 miles north of the US-Mexico border, James and Rachael Stewart have arranged a dozen weightlifting machines and dumbbell sets. At sundown, as they and their four children herd lambs and alpacas into their stalls, the occasional chick or duck passes between these markers of the Stewarts\u2019 previous life. Two years ago, James and Rachael were fitness trainers living in a Phoenix suburb. James traveled frequently to bodybuilding competitions across the south-west, in cities such as Tucson and Albuquerque, and Rachael had just completed a master\u2019s degree in business management. But then the Covid-19 pandemic struck, shutting down meatpacking plants across the country, and they found themselves without the protein sources they needed as athletes \u2013 and parents of four growing children.\nThat\u2019s when an idea came to them that sounded a little impossible at first, but felt more important the more they thought about what doing it would mean for their kids. James sold his 1972 Chevy Caprice and the couple purchased 10 acres of land just outside Douglas, Arizona. They were going to start one of Arizona\u2019s very few Black-owned commercial ranches. In October of 2020, James and Rachael Stewart broke ground on the ranch they are calling the Southwest Black Ranchers. As a biracial couple (James is Black and Rachael is Filipina and Mexican), they immediately began looking for other Black ranchers for guidance \u2013 and so far have struggled to connect with any in Arizona. According to the USDA, Black farmers make up less than 1.5% of the country\u2019s producers and are primarily located in southern and mid-Atlantic states, despite the long, but often forgotten, history of Black ranchers in the American west. Connecting with other Black farmers, ranchers and gardeners across the country through social media, the Stewarts hope to build a ranch that inspires their children and other new generations of Black farmers to return to the south-west.\nIn 1920, Black farmers made up 14% of the industry, but after thousands lost their land due to discriminatory lending practices at the US Department of Agriculture, less than 2% remained. In order to connect with other Black farmers, the Stewarts joined a Facebook group where they met Texans who taught them about hydroponics and a South African farmer whose work on regenerative agriculture is inspiring their goals for the ranch. At home in Arizona, they also connected with Drinking Gourd Farms, a network of Black gardeners and homesteaders in Phoenix, who are helping the Stewarts mulch their farm\u2019s soil. As the Stewarts prepare their ranch they\u2019re hoping to create a world where their children don\u2019t think twice about being part of a Black-led agricultural revolution. When James and Rachael first bought their land outside of Douglas, they were motivated by the inequities they had seen come to light during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tyson Foods had just shut down several of its meatpacking plants and published a full-page New York Times ad warning that \u201cthe food supply chain is breaking\u201d. That same week, the USDA reported that beef production was down 25% and grocery stores started rationing the amount of meat each customer could purchase. That\u2019s when James and Rachael realized the perils of a factory farming system, where the fate of one company could harm their ability to feed their four children. They wondered if they\u2019d have more control if they owned their own livestock \u2013 and if the food supply chain overall might be more sustainable if there were many local farms, meatpackers and processors, as opposed to just a few. Although those questions have continued to motivate them, James and Rachael say it\u2019s their children \u2013 who go by their nicknames J5, Nay, Zey and JG \u2013 that are the real driving force behind their work.\n\u201cWe live in a very white state,\u201d said Rachael, and many people \u201cdon\u2019t realize the societal impact of [Black] kids not seeing positive role models who look like them\u201d. Arizona\u2019s population is only about 5% Black, and nearly 83% white. When the Stewarts discovered that they\u2019d be nearly the only Black ranchers in Arizona, they decided they wanted to fill that gap for their kids. \u201cSometimes you need to actually see something before it can become tangible,\u201d said Rachael. \u201cYou need to see a Black farmer before you realize you could be a Black farmer.\u201d James and Rachael see their work as parents not just as role models, but also as the creators of new systems that they can pass down to their children. \u201cWe want to create a situation where our kids have an option, and they have a trade,\u201d so that if they \u201cdon\u2019t want to take on the debt\u201d of college \u201cthat doesn\u2019t hinder them from being successful\u201d, says James. Although he and his wife both have college degrees, they\u2019d like their children to have choices so they don\u2019t \u201chave to go $80,000 into debt to get a $35,000 job\u201d. We\u2019re trying to \u201ccreate an alternative system for minority and socially disadvantaged ranchers\u201d, says Rachael, so that we can hand over a business to our children \u201cthat is always going to be needed\u201d. Part of that work has involved creating alternative networks with other Black ranchers, farmers, gardeners and entrepreneurs. The Stewarts realize they have a long way to go to make their ranch financially viable for the long term. Although they were able to purchase their initial animals and supplies with the support of a Go Fund Me account, they are now Beta testing approaches to sales, meeting with meat processors, and also applying for grants, including ones from the USDA.\nOne of those first collaborations was with the Drinking Gourd Farms community in Phoenix, which is primarily led by Black Muslim refugee women. During the early months of the pandemic, Drinking Gourd Farms also began to re-evaluate the sustainability of the food supply chain. To make sure Black families had access to healthy food while that system was in turmoil, they distributed food boxes to 4,600 families across the state. When a few of Drinking Gourd Farms\u2019 members heard about the Stewarts\u2019 plans, they drove down to visit the family in Douglas. That\u2019s how James and Rachael met their ranch manager, Grand Rahba. Rahba had spent most of the past decade working at independent farms and gardens across the country, learning sustainable techniques such as composting and permaculture, before landing at Drinking Gourd Farms. On those farms, Rahba says he learned the techniques to \u201cset up an ecosystem that will sustain itself\u201d and the \u201cimportance of having access to stuff, being able to grow your own food, raise animals, have space\u201d. When he met the Stewarts, he was immediately drawn to their mission and bought his own five acres of land adjacent to theirs. For Rahba, Southwest Black Ranchers was an opportunity to prioritize alternatives to capitalism, that would allow him, the Stewarts and other Black farmers to reconnect with the land and their livestock, while reimagining their relationship to work and rest. A history of pioneering Black cowboys It\u2019s late morning on the Stewart\u2019s ranch and Romeo, their sole male alpaca, has gotten loose. He\u2019s supposed to be in his pen while the females graze, but he\u2019s wily and desperate to mate, so instead he\u2019s chasing Soleil \u2013 who seems decidedly uninterested in his affections. The pair are not two feet away from crashing into their pen\u2019s fencing when 12-year-old J5 lassos Romeo in one fell swoop \u2013 accomplishing a skill he and his siblings have been practicing for months. Zey, Nay and JG cheer for their brother as he shepherds Romeo into his stall, and then each takes their own turn trying to lasso the alpaca under J5\u2019s now expert guidance. What none of them realize in the moment is that J5 has mastered a skill that Black ranchers invented and perfected generations before him.\n\u201cIt was enslaved cowboys of African descent in Mexico who invented this new technique of capturing cattle\u201d with a lasso, says Andrew Sluyter, professor at Louisiana State University and author of Black Ranching Frontiers: African Cattle Herders of the Atlantic World, 1500\u20131900. \u201cThe previous way of capturing cattle was simply to ride behind them with a lance that had a sharp blade on the end of it\u201d and cut the tendons in the cow\u2019s rear legs. But then, in the 17th century, there was \u201ca change in the laws that makes it illegal in New Spain and what\u2019s now Mexico for cowboys who are slaves \u2026 to own one of those lances with that halfmoon-shaped blade on the end of it because there were more and more slave rebellions.\u201d That\u2019s when enslaved cowboys developed the idea of lassoing cattle. \u201cThere was this imperative for Black cowboys to advance some kind of alternative means to capture cattle that didn\u2019t involve a weapon,\u201d said Sluyter, who cites an engraving from 1643 of Black cowboys demonstrating the technique by using a long pole to drop a lasso over a cow. \u201cBy the 1700s it had been perfected so they no longer needed that pole.\u201d\nAlthough lassos and cowboy hats are typically associated with white cowboys in the American west, Sluyter says it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that many early ranching techniques were developed by people of African descent. \u201cIf you look at the world in 1492 when Columbus lands in the Caribbean, the largest single area of open range cattle ranching was the Sahel\u201d in Africa, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where cattle and humans evolved together over millions of years\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s where the expertise was.\u201d The word \u201ccowboy\u201d itself originated during slavery when ranchers called Black cow hands by the pejorative \u201ccow boy\u201d. During reconstruction, many formerly enslaved men took jobs as ranch hands and by the late 1800s, historians estimated that one in four cowboys working on the frontier were Black. One of those men was Nat Love, who earned the nickname \u201cDeadwood Dick\u201d in a roping competition in 1876. Another was Bass Reeves, the first Black deputy US marshal west of the Mississippi River \u2013 and allegedly the inspiration for the Lone Ranger.\nToday, the legacy of Black cowboys is continued by groups such as the Louisiana Trail Riders and the Compton Cowboys. For more than a decade, the Arizona Black Rodeo Association has held a rodeo in Phoenix each year. And Black cowboy Lu Vason has, since 1984, hosted the traveling Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, named after the Black cowboy who invented rodeo steer wrestling (or bulldogging). But to this day, few Black cowboys or ranchers actually own their own land or livestock. Finding a home on the land If you ask James and Rachael for their address, they\u2019ll send you GPS coordinates instead. Although their ranch isn\u2019t far outside of Douglas, their neighbors are few and far between \u2013 depending on the route you take, you might see the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs along a neighbor\u2019s fence, but then again you might only spot the distant mountains and mesquite trees. Despite the many neighboring farms, the Stewarts are actually located in a food desert: the only grocery store for miles north of the border is a WalMart. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear of being out on the land, and being rural, and being the only minority there. It\u2019s a valid fear,\u201d said Rachael. Moving out of the city, she and James say, has been precarious. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming out here with money obviously everything\u2019s different, but if you\u2019re not coming out here with money then there\u2019s a lot of change you\u2019ve got to get ready to deal with. It\u2019s not the easiest experience in the world,\u201d says James. But if you do come out on the land, \u201cyou\u2019re getting a lot more freedom\u201d.\nSince moving, James and Rachael have helped three other Black families buy land on their same street. They\u2019re still wary of harassment, but they\u2019ve started building their own networks \u2013 largely made up of people they\u2019ve met on social media, like a South African farmer whose work on regenerative agriculture is inspiring their goals for the ranch and Black ranchers in Texas who have taught them about hydroponics. Black farmers \u201care already doing these things independently because they\u2019ve been forced to\u201d, says Rachael. For generations, official structures, such as the USDA, did not support Black farmers equally, so those farmers created their own systems. But the result, Rachael says, is that those independent networks exist now for ranchers who hope to challenge the factory farming system. The Stewarts have built almost everything on their ranch from scratch. They\u2019ve traded their labor for supplies, built pens out of pallets and wire fencing, and even adopted rehomed animals to grow their flock. \u201cWe\u2019ve never bought anything new. Everything we\u2019ve ever had was used,\u201d says Rachael. That reality can be difficult, she says, \u201csometimes you get to this point where you think you don\u2019t deserve anything\u201d, it\u2019s a mindset that \u201cminorities just always get the leftovers\u201d. But despite \u2013 or rather because of \u2013 that, Rachael says, she and James \u201care trying to create a blueprint for people to follow\u201d. Including their kids. \u201cWhatever we learn, we want to be able to pass on.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-ex-fitness-trainers-creating-a-black-owned-ranch-we-need-a-new-system", "last_update": "2021-11-02T15:44:36Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018So many have gone\u2019: storms and drought drive Guatemalans to the US border", "article": "For the Indigenous Maya Ch\u2019orti\u2019 people of La Uni\u00f3n in eastern Guatemala, the daily struggle for water involves catching every drop of rain that drips from sloping metal roofs and walking long distances to fill plastic containers from overused streams. In this parched region, communities rely on rainfall to feed their families, and in 2019 worked together to build water reservoirs high in the mountains in order to better cope with increasingly frequent droughts and unpredictable rains which caused their maize and bean crops to fail. But the following year brought the opposite problem. After years without enough rain, two powerful hurricanes, Eta and Iota, struck within a fortnight of each other, causing flash floods and landslides that left dozens of people trapped in partially collapsed houses. \u201cWe always worried about not enough water, and then this abundance came. What a disaster,\u201d said Yesenia Mart\u00ednez, the village mayor. It was around 9pm on a November evening when the concrete walls in Martinez\u2019s own home started to collapse. It was pitch black. Children screamed as cracks opened in the floor and rain poured infrom all sides. \u201cWe tried to fill the cracks with stones and plastic sheets, but the earth just gave way. We didn\u2019t lose any lives, thank god \u2013 but we lost everything else,\u201d said Martinez, 38, wiping away tears. It took almost a week for neighbours to rescue Martinez and her family using ropes, sticks and planks of wood to cross the flooded river. The season\u2019s bean crops were ruined, the soil too sodden for replanting. No government help ever arrived.\nAlmost a year later, Martinez and some of her extended family are living in temporary rickety houses built from corrugated metal sheets and wood, far from the river. But there isn\u2019t room for everyone, and so her four youngest siblings are back living in the derelict house. \u201cI cried when I came back here. The house could crumble at any moment or a rock could fall on us while we\u2019re asleep. Of course we want to leave, but we\u2019re poor and don\u2019t have anywhere else to go,\u201d said Mirna Mart\u00ednez, 19. Barefoot children, skinny dogs and noisy chickens mill about the partially collapsed structure, which is held together by wooden beams and crumbling concrete blocks. Two days before the Guardian\u2019s visit, a landslide had gobbled up another chunk of the neighbor\u2019s coffee crops just 50 meters or so away. It wasn\u2019t even raining when the ground gave way. *** Guatemala is one of five Latin American nations \u2013 along with Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia and Haiti \u2013 identified among the 11 countries most at risk from climate chaos due to a combination of geography and poor governance, in a recent US government report on climate and global insecurity. Eta and Iota marked the first time two major Atlantic hurricanes had been recorded in November, and came after six years of drought in Central America\u2019s dry corridor, an impoverished region that is highly vulnerable to catastrophic extreme weather events such as storms, torrential rain, droughts and heatwaves \u2013 all of which are getting longer and more intense due to global heating. Guatemala has contributed very little to greenhouse gas emissions but its people are suffering acutely from their impact. Acute malnutrition in children under five has more than doubled since 2019 due to the hurricane related crop losses, volatile commodity prices and the pandemic. Many campesinos were unable to reach coffee plantations, where they can earn $5 to $7 a day, because damaged roads and bridges were left unrepaired for months.\nFigures show that the largest increase in acute malnutrition cases and child deaths occurred in the regions hardest hit by floods and landslides caused by Eta and Iota. As women cut back on food to provide more for their children, the rate of low birthweight babies also skyrocketed. With few personal resources, little or no government assistance and NGOs struggling to cope with the unprecedented rise in food insecurity across Latin America, many Guatemalans have left in search of work and safety. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s sons, Brian, 21 and Esban, 18, borrowed thousands of dollars to pay coyotes or guides to travel overland to the US. They were repeatedly detained by Mexican immigration officials, but eventually made it to Florida where they work in construction, and have started sending some money home every month.\n\u201cMy sons had to go because we were left with nothing, so many young people have gone. There\u2019s no work here, especially if you\u2019re Indigenous,\u201d said Martinez. One of her sisters also migrated, with her six-year-old daughter. Almost 300,000 Guatemalans have been detained at the US southern border since Eta and Iota struck. It\u2019s unclear how many succeeded in entering the country, but 2021 is on track to break the remittance record, with more than $11bn sent home by Guatemalans in the first nine months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s evident from the numbers at the US border and remittances that the climate crisis and Covid economic downturn has led to a rise in migration as people try to get away from hunger \u2013 you can\u2019t deny this. It\u2019s already happening and the projections are not positive,\u201d said Ricardo Rapallo, the Guatemala representative for the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). At the UN climate talks in Glasgow this week, world leaders will hammer out what help and how much richer countries \u2013 those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 should contribute to cover the costs of climate impacts in lower- income countries. But the lack of scientific data on climate migration is hurting vulnerable countries like Guatemala, said Edwin Castellanos, member of the IPCC\u2019s scientific group on vulnerability and adaptation and dean of the research institute at Guatemala\u2019s Universidad del Valle. \u201cThe future is going to continue like this \u2013 very dry periods followed by very wet periods \u2013 so we have to adapt to both extremes. But the same socioeconomic conditions that make Central America particularly vulnerable also make us invisible scientifically and therefore least able to access funding needed to adapt.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s IPCC report on vulnerability and adaptation, which Castellanos helped write, will conclude that there is \u201clow confidence\u201d on the link between the climate crisis and migration, due to the dearth of scientific research. \u201cWe know from journalistic reporting that climate change is causing migration, but we lack the hard data because we can\u2019t get the funds to get the hard data, which makes accessing international green funds almost impossible. It\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d added Castellanos. *** Maya Ch\u2019orti\u2019 territory extends south from La Uni\u00f3n in Zacapa to Camot\u00e1n in the department of Chiquimula, where rural villages are scattered along dirt roads in the rain shadow of the picturesque Sierra de las Minas. Each house is flanked by clay pots and rows of colorful plastic jars and buckets used by women to collect water for drinking, washing and cooking.\nIn one tiny canton, campesino Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez was sorting through the maize harvest in front of the single-room adobe house where he sleeps with his wife and six children. In 2019, the family was already struggling when the Guardian visited after consecutive years of drought had left them without enough food. So far this year, they\u2019ve had enough maize for Guti\u00e9rrez and the children to eat three tortillas three times a day \u2013 but not his wife, Miriam \u00c1valos, 25, who has two for each meal. She\u2019s skinny, tired and breastfeeding four-month-old David, but must fetch water from the stream every other day when the communal tap runs dry. The three oldest children, aged 11 to 6, are chronically malnourished, and have barely grown since 2019. The two youngest girls, aged 3 and 4, are acutely malnourished after repeated bouts of diarrhea; their hair is falling out in small clumps. Guatemala has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world with almost half of all children suffering chronic malnourishment, but rates are significantly higher among the country\u2019s 24 Indigenous communities. \u201cIt\u2019s worse now than when you visited us before, the earth is so dry nothing grows,\u201d said \u00c1valos. Two years ago, Gutierrez was desperately trying to mortgage the family\u2019s small plot of land to pay a coyote. He\u2019s still trying to find away to migrate so he can provide his family with enough food. \u201cWe keep trying, we work hard, and hope the water comes in time.\u201d This story is part of a Covering Climate Now reporting series on climate migration called Flight for Their Lives.

{"title": "Japan election: rightwing populists sweep vote in Osaka", "article": "On a night when an expected challenge by the main opposition party quickly fizzled out, candidates from a tiny local party seized one seat after another in Japan\u2019s general election, turning an economically vital region into a citadel of rightwing populism. Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Innovation party) almost quadrupled its seats from 11 to 41 on Sunday to become the third largest party in the lower house of Japan\u2019s parliament, after winning almost every seat in the western prefecture of Osaka. While the biggest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic party of Japan, and its allies were counting their losses, Ishin was becoming the most intriguing backstory in an otherwise lacklustre election. By the early hours of Monday, the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), despite winning the national vote, had been summarily dismissed from Osaka by the upstarts from Ishin. Liberals and leftwingers will shudder at Ishin\u2019s rise. But the party succeeded where their candidates had failed, exploiting disillusionment with the LDP and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, and hoovering up votes from people who could not bring themselves to vote for a five-party opposition bloc that included the socialist and communist parties. \u201cNippon Ishin gathered votes from conservative voters who are frustrated with the LDP-Komeito government,\u201d the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said on Monday. A new governing coalition in which Ishin replaces Komeito as the LDP\u2019s official parliamentary ally is unlikely, however. While Ishin shares the LDP\u2019s enthusiasm for higher defence spending and a tougher line on China and North Korea, its opposition to income redistribution would be anathema to the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who campaigned on promises of closing Japan\u2019s wealth gap. Ishin\u2019s emergence as a force in national elections could be an uncomfortable reminder to Kishida that his party is no longer the natural home of conservative voters. Yoichiro Sato, a professor of international relations at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, said Ishin was \u201creally sweeping the Osaka region. They\u2019ve emerged as an important conservative bloc,\u201d adding that its MPs would oppose Kishida\u2019s \u201cnew capitalism\u201d mission to boost incomes. Yu Uchiyama, a politics professor at Tokyo University, did not rule out a political marriage of convenience between the ruling party and Ishin MPs who support changes to Japan\u2019s \u201cpacifist\u201d constitution \u2013 an ideological obsession of Kishida\u2019s mentor, the former prime minister Shinzo Abe. \u201cThere is a lot of interest, especially in Asia, over whether Japan will try to revise its constitution, but by the look of it that won\u2019t be possible with the (existing) ruling coalition,\u201d Uchiyama said. \u201cBut the Japan Innovation party looks like it has captured a lot of seats, so we may be seeing some sort of constitution-related coalition, even if the possibility of constitutional revision remains low.\u201d Formed in 2015 by Toru Hashimoto, the controversial former mayor of Osaka, Ishin benefited from the popularity of its acting leader, Hirofumi Yoshimura, who also serves as Osaka governor. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m most surprised by is how well Ishin has done,\u201d said Kenneth McElwain, a political science professor at Tokyo University. \u201cYoshimura developed a major national profile, which I think has also served as a tailwind for the party overall.\u201d Despite triggering panic-buying of iodine gargle solution last year after wrongly claiming it was effective against coronavirus, the 44-year-old Yoshimura \u2013 whom one party colleague described as a \u201cpop idol\u201d \u2013 won praise for his leadership and communication skills during the height of the pandemic. Yoshimura, who has 1.1 million followers on Twitter \u2013 more than the Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike \u2013 subscribes to traditional rightwing causes such as constitutional reform and prime ministerial visits to Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo. But he is not always an exact fit for the Japanese right\u2019s ideological template, having campaigned for a ban on hate speech towards ethnic Koreans and other minorities in Osaka.

{"title": "Victorian MP\u2019s husband paid taxpayer-funded salary for factional work, Ibac hears", "article": "The husband of a Victorian MP was paid taxpayer funded salaries by three other MPs to do factional work, according to evidence given to the state\u2019s anti-corruption commission. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) resumed public hearings on Monday as part of its investigation into the alleged misuse of public funds for factional activity, including branch stacking, within the Labor party. Branch stacking is not illegal but it is a breach of party rules.\nChris Carr SC, counsel assisting the commission, told the hearing MP Kaushaliya Vaghela agreed in an interview with investigators that her husband, Dinesh Chauhan, had \u201cpredominantly\u201d done factional work when employed in taxpayer-funded electorate officer roles. Chauhan worked in the offices of Marlene Kairouz, Robin Scott and Adem Somyurek. All three were implicated in widespread branch stacking last year, with Kairouz and Scott standing down as ministers, and Somyurek dumped from the ministry and resigning from the party. The trio have denied branch stacking. Vaghela, an upper house MP for western metropolitan region, said she believed her husband was rotated by Somyurek from his office through the offices of Scott and Kairouz as a reward for his ability to recruit members of the Indian community. A transcript of part of Vaghela\u2019s Ibac interview was tendered as evidence to the commission on Monday. \u201cYour husband also, as we\u2019ve already canvassed, has been quite active in the community, quite an active recruiter ... do you think that was the predominant activity he was engaged in during these times?\u201d an investigator asked Vaghela. \u201cYes,\u201d Vaghela replied. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe also agreed with the suggestion that Somyurek, Scott and Kairouz shared full-time staffer roles between their offices for their own factional purposes, including to \u201censure that people who are good recruiters could be kept in the fold\u201d. Vaghela was told during the same interview that records of her husband\u2019s work activity during 2020 showed he had sent one email using the address, which she agreed was \u201chighly suggestive\u201d he was mostly doing factional work. Last month, federal Labor MP Anthony Byrne told the commission that Vaghela, the first Indian-born MP elected to Victorian parliament, was given her spot by Somyurek in exchange for a large number of Indian members recruited by Aloke and Manoj Kumar joining Somyurek\u2019s moderate faction. It was not suggested Vaghela was aware of the scheme.\nVaghela\u2019s evidence came to light during Carr\u2019s questioning of Christine Kelly, an electorate officer who has worked for Kairouz since she was elected in 2008. Carr said Ibac had uncovered evidence of forged documents being produced from the electorate office giving permission for Kelly to pick up ballot papers from ALP headquarters on behalf of members. But Kelly said she had no knowledge of the letters, and could not recall any specific occasion when she collected ballot papers on behalf of members. Kelly denied ever doing factional work for Kairouz, and said she was aware electorate officers were not supposed to do such work on their taxpayer-funded wages. She also disputed that Chauhan was involved in factional work and said he would always be working on official business while she was there.\nShe mostly dealt with constituents, she said, even though Carr showed her phone records for 2019 that showed for six months, the office averaged less than one incoming call per day. Constituents emailed and stopped into the office, Kelly said, but she said that while the former electorate office at Mill Park was in a busy shopping centre, the current Caroline Springs office rarely had visitors. Carr asked Kelly why she had attended a Derrimut branch meeting in 2019 that had to be cancelled after 70-80 members showed up unannounced and were \u201chostile\u201d. Kelly, along with three other staff employed by Kairouz in her ministerial or electorate office, had attended, and Carr asked if it was an attempt to take over the branch. Kelly denied this, and a suggestion she had been one of the \u201cleaders\u201d who was responsible for directing the crowd to sign an attendance book. She said Kairouz had simply asked her to attend the meeting to give an update on local issues such as \u201ca new footpath \u2026 or roundabout being put in\u201d. Kelly also denied seeing Kairouz in the carpark outside the meeting. The hearings continue on Wednesday, when Kirsten Psaila, who has also worked for Kairouz in her electorate office since 2008, will give evidence. Carr started the hearing on Monday by revealing that lawyers for the commission had asked the ALP Victorian branch to provide further information as part of its investigation. But the branch had so far declined to do so, Carr said, meaning the commission may have to compel them to comply.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/victorian-mps-husband-paid-taxpayer-funded-salary-for-factional-work-ibac-hears", "last_update": "2021-11-01T09:19:02Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Salisbury train crash driver suffers \u2018life-changing\u2019 injuries", "article": "A train driver suffered \u201clife-changing\u201d injuries and 13 passengers, including a child, needed hospital treatment after two trains collided as they entered a tunnel in Salisbury. British Transport Police (BTP) said on Monday that they could not rule out foul play but officers do not believe one of the trains was derailed as it hit an object on the line, as had originally been thought. It is understood that police and the rail investigation branch are focusing on issues including the signalling and points, human error and weather conditions at the time. Speaking outside Salisbury railway station, Supt Lisa Garrett, of BTP, said the crash happened at about 6.45pm on Sunday when the Great Western Railway (GWR) service from Southampton to Cardiff collided with a South Western Railway train from London Waterloo to Honiton in Devon as both entered the Fisherton tunnel, close to the city centre.\nGarrett said: \u201cBoth trains were travelling in the same direction and one train struck the other, causing it to derail while in the tunnel. The front few carriages remained upright while the back tipped on their side.\u201d There were a total of 92 passengers on both trains. About 30 people attended a casualty centre set up in a nearby church. Most were \u201cwalking wounded\u201d but 13 passengers were taken to Salisbury district hospital by ambulance, where they received treatment for minor injuries. One remained in hospital in Salisbury on Monday afternoon. Garrett added: \u201cThe driver of the train was more seriously injured and his injuries are believed to be life-changing. He remains in hospital in a stable condition and his family have been informed.\u201d The driver, who was at the controls of the South Western train, had to be cut from the cab and is believed to be in hospital in Southampton. Garrett said a senior detective had been appointed to find out how the trains came together in the tunnel. BTP said it was working with the rail investigation branch and the office of rail and road. She said: \u201cWe are keeping an open mind but there has been nothing to suggest the train stuck an object or there was any significant delay between the trains colliding and one derailing.\u201d Garrett said there was no evidence the driver of the train that had been hit had activated his GPRS button, which warns signallers and other drivers of an emergency. Asked if they had ruled out that anything criminal was involved, she said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out foul play; until the investigation has concluded, we cannot confirm why this has happened.\u201d Passengers told of their horror at the crash. Alan Crocker, a former Royal Navy sailor, who was travelling home to Exmouth, Devon, with his wife, Wendy, said they were travelling at about 20mph when the collision happened. He said: \u201cThe impact was quite weird. There was a jolt and a juddering which I imagine was the train leaving the rails. There was a fireball and a little bit of smoke coming through the train. \u201cThere was a smell of diesel; that was a real concern. That was my initial concern: was there a fire and was there going to be smoke? Our carriage had gone off at a 35-degree tilt.\u201d Dimitri Popa, 17, was in the first carriage of the London Waterloo train. \u201cIt all happened very fast. There was a big crash, then I saw flames,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where we were or anything, we were very shocked.\u201d Morgan Harris, 20, who was travelling on the same train, was thrown from his seat. \u201cIt was all going along normally then all of a sudden there was a massive bang and all of the lights went out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere [were] sparks and flames. Our train was on its side. I was thrown out of my seat and I banged around the table.\u201d Asked about railway safety, a spokesperson for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a top priority for this government, which is why we\u2019ve allocated \u00a340bn-worth of spending to ensure that the railways continue to be one of the safest in the world.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/01/salisbury-train-crash-detailed-and-forensic-investigation-begins", "last_update": "2021-11-01T15:11:50Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Treacle Walker by Alan Garner review \u2013 the book of a lifetime", "article": "Alan Garner\u2019s novels are usually separated into his wildly successful books aimed at children \u2013 The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, Elidor, The Owl Service and The Moon of Gomrath \u2013 and his adult writing \u2013 The Stone Book Quartet, Thursbitch and Strandloper, which are more difficult and quixotic, at least thematically (Garner is always an author of supremely clear and readable prose). I was speaking at an event with Ruth Ozeki and Karen Joy Fowler recently and, having mentioned Garner in my talk, was surprised that neither of them had read \u2013 or even heard of \u2013 him. They asked me where to begin and I suggested the wonderful, time-collapsing Red Shift, largely because I feel like it contains the best of each of Garner\u2019s worlds: the magic of his children\u2019s fiction and the emotional and philosophical complexity of his adult work.\nGarner\u2019s latest novel, Treacle Walker, also belongs in this hybrid space. It, too, is concerned with time. Indeed, it seems as though the subject of time is the theme that underpins much of his later work \u2013 how we experience it, how we might refigure or alter our relation to it. \u201cTime is ignorance,\u201d reads the book\u2019s epigraph, from Carlo Rovelli, and the novel is essentially a response to this idea, seeking to ask how we would experience the world if we were able to step out of the straitjacket of time. Garner lives in a medieval medicine house on a site that has been inhabited for 10,000 years and is a stone\u2019s throw from the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire. It should perhaps not surprise us that, again, he takes time as his subject. Joe, our hero, is a child living a strange and circumscribed existence. He has been poorly, he says, and wears a patch to correct a lazy eye. His parents are not in evidence, and he measures out the days by watching the passing of Noony, the train, through the valley below. One day a rag-and-bone man appears, named Treacle Walker, and offers Joe a cup and a stone in exchange for an old pair of pyjamas and a lamb\u2019s shoulder bone. The cup has Joe\u2019s name written upon it, the stone is inscribed with the picture of a horse. This is classic Garner territory: obscure but resonant objects, a present that feels wedded to a mythical past, a questioning child seeking to unravel the mysteries of an off-kilter world, a landscape freighted with meaning. Joe wanders out into the marshy wood behind his house where he meets Thin Amren, a naked man with copper-brown skin and a hood made of leather. This bog-man informs Joe that his lazy eye is the result of \u201cthe glamourie\u201d \u2013 a gift that enables him to see time collapsed, to perceive the eternal in the now. Joe\u2019s adventures see him drawn into the mirror-world of a comic book, fighting alongside \u201cKit the Ancient Brit\u201d against \u201cWhizzy Wizard and the Brit Bashers\u201d. He\u2019s aided in these battles by the visits of the genial Treacle Walker, with his \u201cgreen violet\u201d eyes and face at once old and young, like \u201cthem knacky postcards that change when you look\u201d. The riotous energy of seemingly throwaway comics is shown to be in communion with the power of myth and both express truths found in the most cutting-edge science. This is a book about quantum physics as well as ancient lore. Garner has always suggested that there is essentially just one story, and this novel, published in his 87th year, contains all the exuberance and eccentricity, all the deep thought and resounding mythology of his best work. At the end of his life, Philip Roth wrote the extraordinary Nemesis, a book that felt like a conversation between the author and his younger self, an attempt to express in a single novel the concerns of a lifetime. Treacle Walker does something similar, cramming into its 150-odd pages more ideas and imagination than most authors manage in their whole careers.

{"title": "\u2018We are protected by prayers\u2019: the sects hampering southern Africa\u2019s vaccine rollout", "article": "Hymnal melodies reverberate around the hillside in Kuwadzana, a Harare suburb. On a blisteringly hot Saturday, members of the Apostolic church, dressed in white, hum and sing together. Songs, long prayers and a little Bible reading punctuate the outdoor service. It\u2019s a spectacle for passersby. Since the Zimbabwean government partly reopened church gatherings in August, Apostolic members, known for their open-air worship, can be seen every weekend around the capital. The government has asked religious groups to endorse the Covid-19 vaccine. The Catholic church, evangelical and adventist groups have done so.\nBut with a tradition of not seeking or trusting medical help, some of the \u201cwhite garment\u201d churches are refusing to encourage congregations to get vaccinated. With millions of followers across southern Africa, the church\u2019s stance could undermine Zimbabwe\u2019s attempts to vaccinate 60% of the population by December. \u201cWe believe in God, and science is entirely subject to God\u2019s will,\u201d says Gramaridge Musendekwa, of the Vadzidzi Apostolic church. \u201cI grew up on my parents\u2019 prayers and I am passing it down to my children. My family will not take the vaccine because we are protected by prayers,\u201d says Musendekwa, 38. \u201cI believe we should not be forced to get vaccinated. For us who grew up without medicine, vaccinations are an insult to our faith and religion. Surely the authorities can achieve whatever they want to do without involving us.\u201d\nThe Apostolic position threatens the success of vaccination programmes in southern Africa, according to research published in the Journal of Religion and Health in 2017, which linked it directly to the rise of measles outbreaks in 2009 to 2010. More than 85% of Zimbabweans identify as Christian, and 37% belong to the Apostolic church. It is 2pm on a Saturday and no one at St Peters Apostolic church in Harare is wearing a government-mandated face mask. After spending hours at a shrine, decorated with red and white flags, Miriam Mushayabasa, 34, a mother-of-three, believes she does not need a vaccine. \u201cOur preacher gave us a clear instruction that if we use these little stones and holy water he prayed for, nothing will happen to our families. Since Covid-19 began last March, my family and I have never suffered from this disease, we are as strong as ever,\u201d says Mushayabasa.\n\u201cMy children are strong, so I have no cause to fear. I have always believed in prayers and this is how I choose to go through this pandemic.\u201d While the government mandates only the vaccinated can attend religious services, it is tough to enforce in the Apostolic churches, who meet outdoors on hilltops and in fields. Zimbabwe\u2019s vaccination programme has inoculated 15% of the population since it began in February. It is one of 15 African countries to have achieved the World Health Organization target of 10% of citizens by September. Regular vaccine consignments are arriving from China, but the government says misinformation and general mistrust have slowed the vaccination programme.\nProsper Chonzi, Harare\u2019s health services director, says the authorities are running campaigns on the benefits of vaccination to increase take-up. \u201cOur efforts to continue engaging them [the church] are there, and now there is more literature. It was more people getting sceptical about the vaccine. There is more knowledge about the vaccine.\u201d Aaron Chakaipa, 40, reflecting the fears of his fellow Apostolic members, says, \u201cI heard that if you get vaccinated, you will not be fertile any more. I am really scared to take it. \u201cI believe an individual should make a personal decision and not be cajoled into taking the vaccination. Telling people to stay away from church if they are not vaccinated is the same as forcing the vaccination, which is not right.\u201d However, Andby Makururu, bishop and founder of the Johane Fifth of Africa Apostolic church in the eastern Manicaland province, is encouraging his members to get vaccinated.\n\u201cWe are transforming the indigenous church to suit global standards. Johane the Fifth of Africa has been on a vaccination drive. In all our preachings, we encourage members to get vaccinations because the Holy Spirit does not cure all these diseases. So I am encouraging the Apostolic sect to go to hospitals and get treatment, I also get treatment and regular checkups,\u201d he says. He says sects who deny the benefits of vaccines are out of touch. \u201cOur children are getting vaccinated. Those that are still behind are lagging but we are moving with the times,\u201d Makururu says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/01/the-sects-hampering-southern-africa-covid-vaccine-rollout", "last_update": "2021-10-27T16:12:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Petrit Halilaj: \u2018I started to live with fear on a daily basis\u2019", "article": "Petrit Halilaj was 13 years old when Serbian troops moved into his Kosovar village, forcing his family to flee and then burning their house to the ground. Piling as much as they could on to a tractor, they took off for his grandfather\u2019s home. When that was also invaded they moved again, flitting from refuge to refuge until they arrived at a camp in Albania, where they sat out the rest of the 15-month war between Serbia and Kosovo. It was there, in the spring of 1999, that Halilaj met up with the Italian psychologist who was to change his life. News reached the tent (in which he was living with his mother, grandfather and four siblings) that Giacomo \u201cAngelo\u201d Poli was giving out paper and felt-tip pens to any child who wanted to draw. Before long he was pouring out images so powerful that the then UN secretary general Kofi Annan asked to meet him during a visit to the camp. \u201cI\u2019d grown up with Kofi Annan. He was bigger than Star Wars to me, so I said to my mum: \u2018I can\u2019t show him a little A4 picture,\u2019\u201d recalls Halilaj. Together they managed to liberate some of the cardboard used to floor the tents, so he could redraw one image of a massacre in a village. The original plan was to give the picture to Annan, but Halilaj\u2019s mind was changed by his grandfather\u2019s insistence that the visit was no more than a piece of political theatre. So, while the image was broadcast around the world, the picture itself stayed in Albania, where Halilaj only rediscovered it decades later. A year after the war ended, the family returned to Kosovo. Halilaj was given a scholarship to art school in Italy, setting him on a course that now brings him to Tate St Ives for his first solo show in the UK. Though Angelo\u2019s visit to the camp only lasted two weeks, it was the start of a lifelong friendship. The two worked together to find an adult sense in the 35 drawings produced during that fortnight, which are the basis of Halilaj\u2019s Tate installation. One room documents his childhood: it not only includes a video of Annan patting Halilaj\u2019s head as he is shown the picture, but an Andrew Testa photograph he discovered years later on the New York Times website, of his little figure, squashed between two plumply upholstered women, in a food queue at the camp. Their plumpness, he points out, is the result of many layers of coloured felt that protected them from the vicious cold, and now plays a signature role in his art. The installation itself is an enchanted forest of images, where parrots and peacocks hover over the churned earth of mass graves and burn you into the mind of a 13-year-old boy who somehow managed to craft his own salvation from the trauma of war. As installers stitch the felt cut-outs to the threads attaching them to the ceiling, the artist runs around poking feathers in here and there \u2013 peacock, chicken, flamingo \u2013 \u201cfor those who care to look closely\u201d. \u201cWhen we talk about the war in Kosovo, we are not talking about a historical situation that has been resolved,\u201d says Halilaj. But it is the artist\u2019s role to find an alternative to \u201cboring diplomacy\u201d. In the end, Halilaj says, \u201clandscape is what remains and gives us dreams of the future. So to me this exhibition is not just fragments of 1999 but fragments of the future, too.\u201d Petrit Halilaj on his Tate installation\nThe blanket \u201cThis red and yellow cover was over the body of a three-month-old baby who was killed in the village of Obri, very close to where we lived. I didn\u2019t put the child in the picture, because for me it\u2019s an image of a massacre. I didn\u2019t want to show the victims, because we\u2019re so bombarded by war images. At first we were told that the soldiers would never hurt children. The murder of this child and his entire family was the moment when I started to live with fear on a daily basis.\u201d\nThe burning house \u201cIn another part of the installation you can see our yellow and red house before it all happened, but here it\u2019s burning to the ground. There\u2019s nothing left of it now. In the background you can see a soldier and a bulldozer, but in the foreground are birds in those first colours Angelo gave us. It\u2019s a way of giving back to him what he gave to us as kids: paper and colour and space for our imaginations. That was such an amazing gift.\u201d\nThe peacock \u201cBirds represented to me the colour and joy of my imagination, even in the worst of places. Behind it you can see the shadow of a soldier with a knife. It\u2019s up to you which way you turn: you have either the unfolding of war or the unfolding of dreams.\u201d\nThe little boy \u201cThis little boy is the one figure I have taken directly from the drawing I made for Kofi Annan. In that, he stands to one side, with a tank rolling in, watching a massacre. I didn\u2019t want to put him in the middle because it\u2019s not a self-portrait, but a picture of all of us.\u201d Petrit Halilaj: Very volcanic over this green feather is at Tate St Ives to 16 January.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/01/petrit-halilaj-i-started-to-live-with-fear-on-a-daily-basis", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:04:22Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "At Cop26 the stage is set for a battle over the next phase of capitalism | Simon Lewis", "article": "The most important UN climate change talks since the 2015 Paris Agreement are upon us, with more than 120 world leaders are arriving in Glasgow for Cop26. The question now is, amid all the big talk, will it make a difference? Given that Cop1 was held in 1995 and carbon dioxide emissions are now 14 billion tonnes a year higher than back then, we can be forgiven for thinking Cop26 is all a charade. But this time it is different, because it is a battle not only over reducing carbon emissions, but also over the rules of a new phase of capitalism that will affect us all. Governments are facing extreme pressure to act now. Climate impacts are hitting home. The climate crisis is no longer abstract and no longer about the future. The heatwaves, floods and droughts we experience or see in the news, and endless reports of more to come, make catastrophe easier to imagine. Public pressure gets ever higher, from Insulate Britain blocking roads to surveys showing most people are seriously concerned about the climate emergency. Scientific reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have unflinchingly shown that we can only stabilise Earth\u2019s climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to an average of zero, known as net-zero emissions. This means that the transition away from fossil fuel energy is not a matter of if, but when. The transition to powering society using renewables is also now technologically and economically feasible. The costs of wind and solar have plummeted to below the cost of building plants to produce electricity generated by oils and gas, with further falls expected. The economic argument for inaction is now gone. Given that countries and companies have left it to the last possible second to take action, and the stakes are sky high, an avalanche of announcements are arriving. What should we make of them? The bewildering complexity of the Glasgow talks can be seen, at its simplest, as a battle among three major blocs of countries, companies and protest movements. They aren\u2019t formal groupings and don\u2019t negotiate together, but can be grouped as they want similar outcomes. The first is composed of the income poor and vulnerable countries, marginalised communities and the protestors who will be outside the SEC as negotiations take place. They want urgent action to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the finance to achieve this, and a plan to adapt to climate change. Equity is at the heart of their demands. The second bloc want to delay climate action by almost any means necessary. These are extractive states, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Australia, and their allies in the fossil fuel and airline industries. The third bloc want a transition to net zero that consolidates their position of power in the world. This is composed of the EU, US, and China, big companies such as Unilever and Amazon, along with much of the financial industry. Aside from China they all argue for markets to deliver net zero efficiently. The three-way battle has already led to some surprising and rapid changes. Countries accounting for some 77% of global carbon dioxide emissions are now covered by mid-century net zero announcements, including countries traditionally hostile to climate action, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Australia, as well as the US, EU, UK and China. But why are climate delayers voluntarily announcing net zero targets? This may be a mix of global opprobrium from the first bloc and plain cynicism because they think they won\u2019t face the consequences of missing these targets. However, it is also likely to be because within the third bloc the EU have agreed, and the Democrats in the US have proposed, \u201ccarbon border adjustments\u201d to impose tariffs on high carbon imports. This means exporter countries will need to reduce their emissions to access these huge markets. This battle to shape the future will continue in Glasgow as countries negotiate rules on transparency, which would allow the UN to check what various nations are doing to achieve their targets. Negotiations on the rules governing carbon markets will also be tense. The prospect of interlinked markets for a new fungible global commodity \u2013 carbon \u2013 is a bonanza that banks and the financial industry are pushing for. But many are wary that carbon accounting tricks will trump real emissions reductions. Overall, there are serious problems with the seemingly sensible thinking of bloc three: that if governments in the core zones of the global economy invest to kick-start a green industrial revolution, then the market will drive down prices for new technological solutions that outcompete fossil fuels and drive down emissions, and carbon border adjustments will bring the world with them. Critically, this will not be anywhere near enough to shut down most of the fossil fuel industry and actually resolve the climate problem. Stopping new exploration for fossil fuels needs to go hand-in-hand with investing in alternatives. Yet, many governments who set themselves up as rational followers of the science are self-delusional. They cut emissions at home while also licensing yet more oil, coal and gas for export. Norway, the UK, the US and Canada are all doing this. A perhaps more fundamental problem of the EU, US and UK market-driven approach is that markets are not fair. The Covid vaccines scandal has shown how new technology and market approaches have left billions vulnerable. Unprecedented international cooperation is needed to tackle the climate crisis. And within countries, if the transition to net zero is not experienced as a fair and just transition, plans will be derailed and catastrophe beckons. Glasgow is a pivotal moment. The world cannot afford any more delays in climate action, so the climate-wreckers must not get their way. But for the most powerful countries and companies, they must realise that a transition to net zero can\u2019t be achieved by relying on markets. They need to listen to the vulnerable countries and people. Solving the climate crisis needs action that is both fast and fair.

{"title": "Why accounts of Philadelphia train passengers not intervening in a rape spread", "article": "The news was horrifying, a parable of inhumanity so grim that it was destined to go viral. Two weeks ago, police said that passengers on Philadelphia\u2019s elevated train watched a man rape a woman and did not intervene \u2013 and that some riders might have even recorded the 13 October attack with their cellphones. These onlookers did not call for help during the attack. The only person who dialed 911 was an off-duty transit worker, police alleged.\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by those who did nothing to help this woman,\u201d Timothy Bernhardt, superintendent of the Upper Darby Township police department, said on 16 October. \u201cAnybody that was on that train has to look in the mirror and ask why they didn\u2019t intervene or why they didn\u2019t do something.\u201d Bernhardt said the passengers who stood idly by might even face criminal charges, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Transit authorities made similar statements and the story rapidly spread around America and then the world as a grim symbol of an uncaring society, obsessed with social media over helping a victim being attacked. But, it now seems, the story was not entirely accurate. In fact, the story is far more complex, revealing not only a brutal crime, but how a mistaken narrative ran wild in the press. At the same time, the appalling rape does reveal social problems in America, but they center around crime, the pandemic and policing, not the baleful influence of social media. The Delaware county district attorney, whose office is prosecuting the case against alleged rapist Fiston Ngoy, said this portrayal of bystanders callously videoing the crime was \u201csimply not true\u201d. The prosecutor, Jack Stollsteimer, said it was wrong for authorities and media to advance the narrative that people were \u201ccallously sitting there filming and didn\u2019t act\u201d, calling this \u201cmisinformation\u201d. While Ngoy\u2019s alleged interactions with the victim took place over a 40-minute period, starting with unwanted talking and then groping, the rape lasted about six minutes. Other riders were not on the train for the entire duration of their interaction, and might not have known what was happening, Stollsteimer said. Surveillance video from the train revealed two passengers raised their phones toward the assault, and that one of those provided their video to authorities, AP said.\nThe dramatic turn of events has raised questions about how the original narrative took off, and why it might have staying power. There is no single answer \u2013 explanations are multifaceted and nuanced, ranging from police accountability to broad societal fears to longstanding concerns over public safety. But one definitive starting point is the Kitty Genovese case. The 1964 murder of Genovese in New York City rose to international notoriety after a New York Times report claimed that nearly 40 people witnessed her being attacked and didn\u2019t try to help her. The incident prompted extensive study, and the so-called \u201cbystander effect\u201d \u2013 a notion that when everyone thinks that someone else will act, nobody does \u2013 became de rigueur in psychology coursework. Many years later, it emerged that the Times\u2019 description of bystanders was incorrect. Far fewer people had actually witnessed Genovese\u2019s murder than was reported and some did contact authorities. One of Genovese\u2019s neighbors went out to help her, cradling the dying 28-year-old while waiting for paramedics. Most glaringly, an ambulance came to the scene \u201cprecisely because neighbors had called for help\u201d, the New Yorker said in explaining how the original narrative was debunked. Indeed, present-day research on bystanders stands in opposition to initial police accounts about the Septa passengers. A study based on closed-circuit television footage of 200 violent crimes across three countries found that \u201cin 90% of those cases, bystanders did intervene\u201d, explained Elizabeth Jeglic, a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\u201cSo the bystander effect, as we had known it or had taught it for decades, may not be applicable today,\u201d Jeglic said. \u201cThere are various factors that go into people acting and reacting, but for the most part, if the crime is clear, and it\u2019s a serious crime, in almost all cases people will intervene.\u201d When bystanders are worried about their own safety, or physically incapable of intervening, they might step in by going for help or calling the police. Some have hypothesized that bystanders\u2019 filming might even be an attempt at intervention. \u201cThey may be trying to help in videotaping it because it may be helpful in the prosecution of the crime later on,\u201d Jeglic said. Roy Peter Clark, senior scholar at the Poynter journalism institute in St Petersburg, Florida, said the concept of \u201cmaster narrative\u201d \u2013 effectively, cultural motifs that really stick \u2013 helps explain why the initial story resonated, even if facts ultimately don\u2019t add up. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it a master narrative \u2013 other stories are rejected as false or misleading or misinformation if they don\u2019t fit the particular narrative,\u201d said Clark, who has written about and discussed the Genovese case. Genovese\u2019s story appeared to prove a story about \u201cthe loss of community, urban isolation and alienation\u201d, not to mention the decline of good samaritanism. The same thing may have been at play with the Septa attack. \u201cIt may be magnified by the current moment \u2013 pandemic, catastrophic weather, economic disruption, people being unable to exercise the normal constructive communal rituals of a community and a society,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhatever darkness there is in these master narratives, they may have been magnified by our collective current experience.\u201d Jeglic voiced similar sentiments, saying: \u201cWe are in a period of time where everything is very polarized and we often jump to conclusions without considering all aspects of situations. \u201cA lot of people want to be drawn to the narrative that there\u2019s a lot of doom and gloom in humanity, that people are acting in very negative ways.\u201d But to dismiss the story would also be a mistake, say the people who actually live in the communities served by Septa and who ride its trains. Septa passengers in Philadelphia and the suburb of Upper Darby didn\u2019t find the notion of uncaring bystanders all that implausible, based on their own concerns about safety predating the rape. When presented with the fact that initial descriptions of uncaring bystanders appeared to be untrue, the consensus was that it made little difference. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you cannot see a sexual act,\u201d said Victoria Evans, 38. \u201cI would have rather taken my chances intervening than not saying anything.\u201d Evans, a certified nurse\u2019s assistant, said that body language should have made people think twice about what they saw. \u201cIt would look uncomfortable. You can tell the difference. There\u2019s no way nobody knew something was wrong.\u201d \u201cI was really sad because I take the [train] everyday,\u201d said Nasherah Tucker, 18. \u201cI don\u2019t really feel safe anywhere in Philadelphia, especially as a woman.\u201d Tucker said the fact that the rape took place in public, on a train, was incredibly disheartening. Even if the original police account regarding bystanders weren\u2019t true, she said, \u201cI think someone should have definitely said something.\u201d Many passengers, many of them people of color and especially women, do find riding public transport in the city a scary experience, where crime seems possible and a police presence seems thin on the ground. \u201cIt was a mix of both being surprised and not being surprised,\u201d said Noor Rana, a 19-year-old biology student, of her reaction to the incident. \u201cI was kind of scared \u2013 scared for myself, for other women my age. \u201cGo tell the police. Get to another car. There\u2019s so many things that you could do,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse not to do anything.\u201d Would she feel differently about the bystanders if they didn\u2019t know what was happening, as authorities have now said? \u201cThis is Philadelphia. Crazy stuff happens, so I feel a lot of people tend to ignore stuff,\u201d she said. Even if people mistakenly thought the encounter were consensual, they should have notified authorities, because \u201cit\u2019s still indecent\u201d. Some of those interviewed said that there needed to be a greater police presence on the the transport network. \u201cThey get paid to protect the public. You don\u2019t see them do anything. Police don\u2019t patrol inside trains,\u201d said Esdras Taylor, 46. \u201cThe public is not going to do it. They should be doing their jobs.\u201d But in the aftermath of the attack, even before Stollsteimer provided more information, some residents remained optimistic.\nJenice Armstrong, a metro columnist with the Inquirer, did not believe the description of bystanders originally put forth by police. \u201cIt took me a while to write something,\u201d Armstrong said in an interview. \u201cI thought about it every day after I heard the initial report, but I just kept trying to picture it and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d She told herself that there had to be more to the story. Before Stollsteimer provided the additional information, Armstrong was working on a column about how something didn\u2019t seem to add up. Then came word of Stollmeister\u2019s press conference. She rushed over there. \u201cI was glad I did, because it bolstered my initial hunch I had \u2013 that it didn\u2019t happen the way people were saying that it happened,\u201d she said. In the column Armstrong wrote after this information came out, she interviewed Septa police officer Tom Schiliro, who with his partner apprehended Ngoy when the train arrived at the 69th Street station. Schiliro told her that other riders quickly pointed out Ngoy. \u201cAs soon as the train cars opened, everyone was pointing, \u2018It\u2019s over there! It\u2019s over there,\u2019\u201d Schiliro told her. The week before, Schiliro arrested another man at this station for sexual assault. A good samaritan hurried to help the victim; Schiliro heard shouting and rushed to the incident. \u201cPeople are so quick to believe the worst about humanity. And ignore the good among us,\u201d Armstrong wrote. \u201cPhilly is a tough, tough city,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I would like to think that it\u2019s not so tough that you have passengers on a train standing around videotaping a woman being actively raped.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/philadelphia-police-bystanders-filming-mistaken-narrative", "last_update": "2021-11-01T16:42:27Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Time is running out\u2019: your messages for world leaders at Cop26", "article": "World leaders must commit to actions rather than promises, renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, and future security rather than present consumption, according to hundreds of messages from Guardian readers and supporters submitted to the Cop26 climate summit. As policymakers gather in Glasgow for the two-week summit, readers and supporters called for rapid divestment from fossil fuels, deeper investment in renewable energy and regenerative agriculture, and an end to the fixation on GDP as a measure of progress in society. The summit, which culminates on 12 November, will consider concrete cuts to carbon emissions, following the 2015 Paris agreement in which nations pledged to keep global temperature rises to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nA callout asking readers and supporters what messages they would like to impress on world leaders as they head to Glasgow elicited more than 800 submissions from around the world. Hundreds of respondents implored leaders to think about future generations and the burden they will bear as a cost of inaction. Readers emphasised the need for people in richer countries to adapt their ways of living, while a number of messages urged world leaders to understand that the summit is humanity\u2019s \u201clast chance\u201d to implement meaningful climate solutions. A sample of responses follows. \u2018We need world leaders to commit to taking drastic action and to actually do it\u2019\n\u201cI live on the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago. We, like the rest of the Caribbean, are paying the price for climate change even though we have contributed very little to it. Storms, droughts, rising seas \u2013 my children are going to suffer, not only for things you did but for the things you have avoided doing: reducing emissions and taking drastic action to prevent global warming. Where I live now is likely to be flooded out by rising seas in less than 100 years. It means my grandchildren are unlikely to continue to live in our generational home \u2013 I\u2019m the third generation to live here. The area we live in used to flood once every 10 years, now it\u2019s every year. In the Caribbean, it\u2019s become a waiting game every hurricane season. There is a sense of helplessness. We need you to commit to taking drastic action and to actually do it. There is no more time left to delay.\u201d Sachin Ganpat, 44, IT professional, Trinidad and Tobago \u2018Treat the climate crisis as an emergency\u2019\n\u201cAround the world, governments acted to treat the Covid-19 pandemic as an emergency. We saw the money they\u2019re prepared to invest in order to deal with the pandemic. We\u2019ve not seen anything like a similar response for climate change, which, without a doubt is a much bigger threat to our future survival. Why are governments failing so spectacularly to treat the climate and ecological crises as the emergencies they are? These are the defining problems of our time. The planet is fast approaching cascading tipping points which threaten the stable climate our planet has known for thousands of years, and with it, life as we know it.\u201d Julie Parker, early 60s, retired research scientist, Bristol, UK \u2018End the blind pursuit of GDP\u2019\n\u201cWe have to acknowledge that blind pursuit of GDP is the root cause of the climate crisis. In the case of countries like Indonesia, where most people live outside of the GDP, in the informal sector, to talk about GDP constantly is actually destructive. Much of Indonesia\u2019s GDP comes from extractive industries like palm oil and building infrastructure, which often relies on land-grabbing. This colonial-style economy is why we are in trouble \u2013 land use and deforestation is Indonesia\u2019s number one contributor to greenhouse gases. By design, the pursuit of GDP is destructive. We know that it\u2019s not possible to grow infinitely in a finite world, but the very nature of GDP is that you always want more. We must shift this distorted view of the economy.\u201d Melissa Kowara, 32, wooden toy maker and climate activist, Jakarta, Indonesia \u2018Stand up to multinationals and fossil fuel companies\u2019\n\u201cTime is running out. The vast majority of politicians will not be alive to see the worst consequences of the climate crisis, but those of my generation are keenly aware that we will be the ones to deal with a crisis we did not create. If ever there has been a time for selflessness, for leadership in the face of adversity, it is now. Stand up to multinationals and fossil fuel companies, to corporate interests weaving their money into political campaigns. Tax and emissions loopholes allow the largest polluters, including fossil fuel companies, to move their emissions around and use smart accounting to hide their emissions and avoid accepting responsibility. Stand up to those that say capitalism is the only solution, and dare to think differently. Listen to young people, and give us a seat at the table like the rightful stakeholders we are.\u201d Nick Gutkin, 26, intern at a carbon crediting company, Rotterdam, the Netherlands \u2018Talk about fair distribution of our planet\u2019s resources\u2019\n\u201cWe need to talk about what it means for us in the global north to lower our standard of living in order to save the world\u2019s resources. How can we bridge the gap between people\u2019s expectations and the reality of what one planet can offer, for a fair distribution? What are the dreams we can dream and what are the dreams that are someone else\u2019s nightmare? Does lowering our standard of living necessarily mean lower quality of life? I think we have to reconsider a lot of the things that we take for granted: fashion, travel, lifestyle choices like that. Things that perhaps Covid restrictions showed us that we could actually do without.\u201d Marianne Morild, 49, artist, Bergen, Norway \u2018Reduce animal agriculture\u2019\n\u201cAnimal agriculture is one key area which is not sufficiently talked about. Globally, livestock use more than 80% of the world\u2019s farmland and 56% of the greenhouse gas emissions from food. Reducing animal agriculture would have positive implications for food security, climate change, pollution and biodiversity. It would free up huge amounts of land which could then be rewilded. It is important to work closely with farmers to support them with any such changes. But we cannot keep ignoring this elephant in the room.\u201d Hannah Howarth, 31, postgraduate student, France \u2018Think about future generations\u2019\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect you who are reading this to care about me, beyond in the most abstract sense. I want you to think about your children instead. Your grandchildren. Your nephews. Your nieces. Anyone you personally know and love under the age of 30. I want you to think about how your actions will shape the world they inherit. I want you to think about how [people in power are] pushing us further to the end of human civilisation, the death of progress, and the extinction of almost every living thing on this globe. Young people see no future.\u201d Fergus McAteer, 30, quality assurance engineer, Edinburgh, UK\n\u2018Solving the climate crisis is a question of political will\u2019\n\u201cWe live on a finite planet, and economic growth is no longer a viable measurement of success, especially when surplus wealth is concentrated into a few hands. We need to act more urgently than we have ever done anything as a species. End all fossil fuel extraction now, stop cutting down the world\u2019s tropical forests, invest in renewable energy and regenerative agriculture. We need to invest the carbon budget into expanding renewable resources as quickly as possible, but also with drastic cuts in energy needs in the western world. It\u2019s a matter of political will. We don\u2019t have time for more of the same schemes, clever accounting, and broken promises \u2013 the future of all species is at stake and you are failing us.\u201d Andrew Payton, 35, works in online education, Virginia, US \u2018Time is running out \u2013 I want to see actions, not promises\u2019\n\u201cI want to see actions instead of beautiful and unrealistic promises, I want to see trees being planted, I want to see renewable energy sources and cutting emissions. While you are postponing real and concrete actions, my country is drying up, our forests are being consumed by hell-like flames, my body is being exposed to harmful temperatures, our animals are being extinguished at an unprecedented level. I want to see progress \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of time until the irreversible. We\u2019ve had a lot of summits but not a lot of action.

{"title": "Locked down in Cornwall, the sea brought me energy and spiritual healing ", "article": "The first lockdown, my family did medium-to-spicy well. It was me, my husband Mark, [my daughter] Tash and her boyfriend, Oliver. When the kids were fleeing university in London, and Tash said, \u201cIs it OK if Oliver and I come down?\u201d Mark and I said, \u201cOf course!\u201d \u2013 thinking that they would be down for three weeks at the most, like a long school holiday. Five months later, they were still there. We were very fortunate to be in Cornwall, in the country \u2013 we had more space than some people. We\u2019re a hop, skip and a jump from the water. There\u2019s a ferocious beauty to the Cornish coast. There\u2019s the gorgeous beaches, but then there are the crags and the rocks. There\u2019s something gently brutal about it. I surrendered to the land at a certain point: OK, I\u2019m in exile here. I can\u2019t get back to the States, because I don\u2019t know if I can get back [into the UK] if I go. If I can\u2019t get back to Mark and Tash, then I\u2019m going to evaporate. Because they are the reason I wake up in the morning. By the third lockdown, however, in January of this year, I was not at my best. I was grieving not playing live for the longest time in my life, not doing what musicians do. There isn\u2019t the spiritual ceremony of the collaboration with a live audience. We\u2019re talking about a voltage that I can\u2019t achieve by myself. That was gone, and there was no way to recreate that. The closest thing was to go to the ocean and feel when the tides are coming in and hitting those rocks. Yes, the sea can be calm and gentle, but when the gales are blowing, my goodness \u2013 now that\u2019s voltage.\nI became despondent and sad, and filled with loss. You\u2019re trying to find different coping mechanisms at 50-some years old, and sometimes not even realising that that\u2019s what you\u2019re needing to do. And that\u2019s where the songwriting began. The muses said to me: \u201cWrite from where you are. And where you are is on your knees in a grief and a sadness. You have to start from there.\u201d It was my own private little hell that I had to write myself out of. At first, I wrote from the chair I was sitting in, because I couldn\u2019t get out of it \u2013 [I didn\u2019t have] the energy that it took. I was able to make dinner with Tash. It was something we would share. But Mark gave up on trying to coax me into the studio. I don\u2019t need to be by an instrument to write; it\u2019s just not necessary \u2013 it is at a certain point, once I\u2019m exploring the structures that I\u2019ve thought in my head, but I needed to get out of this lethargy. The song Metal Water Wood came first. I was trying to combat this force of despondency, loss \u2013 a quagmire of \u201cWhat is this that\u2019s zapping us, almost stealing our life force?\u201d I started reading about Bruce Lee. I don\u2019t know why I was drawn to him. The muses take me to places sometimes, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily make linear sense. But he said: \u201cBe like water.\u201d As a fire being, as a fire creature, that was almost as if I was betraying the element that has always gotten me through stuff before. Once it was wintertime and I started going out into the land, I began to realise I needed to do it more and more. In that act of engaging with it, it began showing me, it began collaborating with me, with the songs. And the muses, of course, were there. I had to say: \u201cOK, I know I\u2019m a guest here, but will you share your secrets with me?\u201d And the land said to me: \u201cAre you worthy? What are you going to do with these secrets, Tori? Will you honour them? Or are you going to bend them to suit your own needs? Or are you going to be really honest, that this has broken you?\u201d And I said: \u201cI\u2019m not the mom I want to be. I\u2019m not the wife I want to be. I\u2019m not the artist I want to be.\u201d And they immediately rolled their eyes and said: \u201cOh, please stop with the dramatic postmenopausal crap.\u201d\nI want to step out of it, but you have to sometimes admit you\u2019re not there. You\u2019re in the middle of a complex conundrum. My mom passed away a couple of years ago. People talk about stages of grief. And sometimes you have to say: \u201cYou know, I miss my mom. And she\u2019s not here, and I can\u2019t call her. And she would know what to say.\u201d And then Tash finally walks in the room: \u201cOK, I need my mom back. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have your mom. I\u2019m really sorry. And I miss grandma. But I need my mom.\u201d Jesus. Then you go: \u201cOK, I have to stop being the child missing her mother.\u201d When I was a child, I would travel by listening to the Beatles\u2019 work and then playing it at the piano. The music was able to take me to anywhere in the universe. If the music was right, I could jump on that sonic spaceship and go. And I had to relearn that skill, but the trick this time was I needed to write a song in order to try and find my mom, Mary. She\u2019s in Speaking with Trees and Flowers Burn to Gold. People have said to me: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to shame you, T, but you had a mother who had unconditional love. You\u2019ve experienced that. What a gift. Can you hold on to that gift? She runs through your veins too, so if you can channel the songs, can\u2019t you channel her?\u201d And, God, that left me speechless. The playwright Samuel Adamson, who I worked with on The Light Princess, sent me a message. He\u2019s such an amazing writer. He said: \u201cI just had a vision. And I have to tell you, Cornwall\u2019s protecting you.\u201d I thought, What? And he said: \u201cI\u2019m just giving you a message. I know this to be true. She\u2019s protecting you. She\u2019s keeping you safe.\u201d And I felt, OK, then I need to keep her safe. Not that she needs protecting in that way, but her stories. I need to give something back to this majestic, compassionate energy. The way to reflect that energy was a collaboration with the land, the water and the muses. Trying to give people a glimpse of this essence that I\u2019ve spent 18 months with. The mythology of Cornwall feels alive. It doesn\u2019t feel in the past. If you squint your eyes and don\u2019t look at the cafe on your right, but look around you, there\u2019s something so ancient about it.

{"title": "How to start investing safely and profitably", "article": "Have the spare cash Inflation is running at 3.1%, and finding a savings account paying above that is impossible. But many experts claim you can reasonably expect investments to grow by about 4% a year after fees are taken into account, or more if the stock market has a strong run. If you invested \u00a350 a month for 10 years and enjoyed a 3.9% return, you would end up with \u00a37,348, according to investment firm Fidelity. That\u2019s growth of \u00a31,348 on your contributions. Carry on for 20 years and your profit rises to \u00a36,193. If you are in it for the very long term, and are lucky, your returns may be supercharged thanks to the power of compounding. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, your investment earns returns, and those gains are reinvested and start earning returns, too. However, remember investing means taking some risk \u2013 it\u2019s possible investments could fall in value, so this isn\u2019t for everyone. First, you need some cash set aside for emergencies, so allocate some of your savings to that. It\u2019s also vital to tackle any expensive debt, such as credit or store cards, before diving into the stock market. Assess your risk Before choosing where to put your money, decide on your risk profile. In other words: how comfortable are you with seeing the value of your investments fall? As a rule, the sooner you need your money, the less risk you should take. Online investment providers designed for self-starters, such as Nutmeg, Evestor, Wealthify, and sustainable investment provider Clim8, simplify this. Pick from a few investment options, rather than thousands of funds, after the providers have asked basic questions about your preferences and goals to match you to suitable options. Start small Investing a small amount every month is a great way to get started. You could, say, kick off with \u00a325 a month into a single fund, although some providers will accept contributions from as little as \u00a31. Regular investing will help to iron out the highs and lows of the market. You buy more shares when the stock market is performing poorly and the price is lower, and fewer when their value rises. You can invest a lump sum, too, if you have some cash savings you want to put to work in the stock market, for example, but this is a higher risk strategy as you might be buying at the top of the market. Pick funds Rather than buying shares in individual companies, funds are a good option for beginners. They hold a range of different companies, so you don\u2019t have all your eggs in one basket. \u201cWhen it comes to choosing funds, I think of personal investors in three broad camps: \u2018choose for me\u2019, \u2018help me choose\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ll choose myself\u2019,\u201d says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International. Many investment websites offer best-buy fund lists put together by experts, including Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Wealth Shortlist, and Interactive Investor\u2019s Super 60. There are two main fund types: index trackers and active funds. Trackers, also known as passive funds, follow a particular market index such as the FTSE 100. They typically return the average of the market they invest in, and, as there is no one choosing the investments, they are the cheaper option. Active funds are usually more expensive as they have a manager who chooses the shares they hold, aiming to beat the market. You can pick from thousands of funds, such as those focusing on, for example, sustainable investments, smaller companies or emerging markets. Holding a range of funds spreads your money and protects you from market falls. If one company falls in value, hopefully another will rise. Go ready-made If you don\u2019t know where to start, you could go for a single, ready-made fund that holds investments from around the world. Interactive Investor has a list of six quick-start funds. \u201cThese are well-diversified, multi-asset portfolios that are very competitively priced,\u201d says Moira O\u2019Neill, its head of personal finance. They include Vanguard\u2019s LifeStrategy funds, each investing in thousands of global companies. Alternatively, there are model portfolios on investment websites. These include a mix of some of the most popular funds and can be used as a template to build your own portfolio. AJ Bell Youinvest offers four ready-made options, tailored to whether you are cautious, balanced, adventurous or seeking income. Check charges Watch out for fees, as these can really eat into your returns. Investment providers either charge a percentage fee, based on how much you invest, or a fixed fee. Comparetheplatform.com offers a simple calculator to help you find the most appropriate and cheapest provider. \u201cA percentage charge is better for portfolios up to \u00a350,000, and Vanguard is the cheapest but has a limited selection of investments,\u201d says Bella Caridade-Ferreira, the chief executive of Comparetheplatform. If you are investing a larger lump sum, you will be better off with Interactive Investor, which charges \u00a39.99 a month, including one free trade a month, she adds. As your investment grows, charges stay the same with a flat fee. You\u2019ll pay for your investments on top of this fee, and to buy and sell funds. Average charges on active funds are about 0.75%, which, on top of a 0.25% service fee, brings the total to 1% a year. Use your Isa allowance Wrapping your investments in a stocks and shares Isa means you won\u2019t pay tax on profits, or need to include them on your tax return. This tax year you can hold up to \u00a320,000 in an Isa wrapper. You can invest all, or some, of your allowance in a stocks and shares Isa, and hold any investments you wish. Stay invested Investing can be a bumpy ride, but it generally pays to hold your nerve. You need a time frame of at least five years, ideally far longer. If you can sit tight through market falls your investments may bounce back and go on to be worth more. \u201cGreat years can often follow terrible ones,\u201d says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. \u201cIn 1974 the UK was beset by recession, a miners\u2019 strike, three-day weeks and an oil crisis \u2013 the FTSE All Share tanked 55%. The following year it rose by 140%.\u201d If you want further help before investing, seek assistance from a financial adviser, but you will need to pay.

{"title": "Is this a watershed moment when it comes to sewage in England\u2019s rivers and seas? | Rachel Salvidge", "article": "The groundswell of disgust over water firms dumping raw human sewage into England\u2019s rivers and seas has grown into a roiling tsunami threatening to overwhelm the government. By their own confession, water companies say they dumped untreated sewage into English water bodies more than 400,000 times last year, for a total of about 3.1m hours. As shocking as that seems, you can safely assume this figure grossly underplays the true picture because not all sewage discharges are recorded, and because the sector is allowed to self-report its spills, a practice that begs to be abused. Take a look at Southern Water, which was fined \u00a390m for repeatedly and deliberately dumping raw sewage into seas along the south coast, while misreporting its performance to the regulator, the Environment Agency. Or you could ask the data scientist who has calculated that Thames Water may not be reporting 95% of its illegal dirty discharges. For its part, Thames Water says it will look carefully at the findings and stresses that it regards all untreated sewage discharges as unacceptable. So how did we get into this mess? When water companies\u2019 sewerage infrastructure is overwhelmed by sewage and rainwater, it is dumped into rivers and on to beaches via combined sewer overflow pipes, rather than allowing it to back up and cause flooding. In many cases it\u2019s not illegal because the Environment Agency issues the firms with permits allowing the discharges on condition that it only happens under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d when there is heavy rainfall \u2013 and only then if the water company is already treating a specified volume of sewage. But companies are dumping with such appalling regularity, and during dry weather, that the term \u201cexceptional\u201d has lost all meaning. But when called out over the horrific pollution, the sector and the Environment Agency simply point at the creaking infrastructure they inherited from the Victorians, perhaps not realising that in doing so they\u2019re demonstrating just how overdue an upgrade to the system is. It hardly needs saying, but there are around 27 million more people in the UK now than at the end of the Victorian era, so you\u2019d think someone somewhere might have thought about the extra sewerage capacity needed to cope with that. Apparently not. Since privatisation, the water sector has paid out billions of pounds in dividends and director salaries and bonuses, and although it has invested in water treatment it has not found the cash to stop the rampant pollution. Given that the financial regulator, Ofwat, has not seen fit to force them to end it, can we really blame them? They have fiduciary duty to their shareholders, after all. I\u2019m kidding: of course we can blame them, but the regulators and successive governments are also at fault. The half-starved Environment Agency, with its budget repeatedly slashed, is reduced to accepting whatever figures the industry supplies to it rather than play the role of fearsome watchdog. By its own admission, aside from the occasional prosecution, it can\u2019t take on polluters with paltry resources, despite the best efforts of its remaining frontline staff. Meanwhile, the population keeps growing, rainfall intensifies, and all across the country ugly pipes continue to spew their nauseating contents into our waters, choking wildlife and infuriating water users. Fish die, beaches are closed, rivers run rich with effluent. But things could be about to change \u2013 because the water sector\u2019s dirty little secret is now exposed, thanks to the hard graft of campaigners who have refused to stop banging on about it and lockdown-enforced staycations focusing more people\u2019s minds on the state of the UK\u2019s coastlines and rivers. So what is the government planning to do about it? Initially, not much. But public pressure is a powerful thing and the furore of recent days has embarrassed the government into making a number of changes to the environment bill that is currently making its way through parliament. It is keen to show it is serious about tackling sewage pollution now everyone knows it\u2019s happening.\nOver the past few months, the government has been dragged from its position that giving the water firms a stern ticking off was all that was needed, to reluctantly adding amendments to the bill requiring it to make plans to reduce discharges; though these changes are lacking targets or timelines to make the reforms concrete. More recently, as part of a parliamentary ping-pong, the House of Lords demanded stronger action, adding their own amendment to the bill which would place a duty on \u201csewerage undertakers to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows into inland and coastal waters\u201d. In response, the government has said it intends to table its own amendment that would place a direct legal duty on water companies to \u201cprogressively reduce the impacts of sewage pollution from storm overflows\u201d. You\u2019ll notice that \u201creducing the impacts of sewage pollution\u201d is not the same as saying it will require the sector to stop it entirely. The devil, as always, will be in the detail. The difference this time around is that everyone is watching.

{"title": "Sunbathers of Beirut: the photographs celebrating everyday life in the Middle East", "article": "On 4 August 2020, Fouad Elkoury was sitting in his home in Beirut when an enormous explosion at the port shattered his windows and blasted through his living room. Miraculously, the Lebanese photographer survived but his home was destroyed, along with those of an estimated 300,000 others. \u201cWhen you go through such an explosion,\u201d he says, \u201cfirst, your memory disappears. Second, your hearing is ruined. And third, you stop planning. Things are so big, you realise you are nothing. This is where I am at the moment.\u201d One of Lebanon\u2019s foremost photographers, Elkoury came to international recognition with his intimate photographs documenting life during the Lebanese civil war in Beirut in the 1970s and early 80s. Travelling in the years following the conflict, he found himself aboard the ship carrying Yasser Arafat during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. He created Atlantis, a nautical series of images featuring the Palestinian leader. Typical Elkoury shots juxtapose the personal and the political, producing images that imbue scenes of everyday life with the heavy resonance of their often traumatic histories. They include Portemilio, Lebanon, 1984 \u2013 a black and white image of sunbathers reclining by a fountain at a holiday resort north of Beirut, while the year the image was taken reminds the viewer that, a few miles out of the frame, conflict was raging. In Changing the Wheel, two well-dressed men stare imposingly into the lens while their driver replaces a tyre. It\u2019s not just a microcosm of social hierarchies \u2013 in the background, you can see the blasted-out shells of Beirut high rises. Life and its rituals go on, Elkoury shows, even amid the chaos.\nWe are speaking by phone, since Elkoury has spent the past year relocated at his family\u2019s \u201cmountain house\u201d in the countryside, where the electricity and the internet are unreliable. Despite having spent much of his life on the move, initially coming to London as a young man to study as an architect, the past two years have seen him grounded, with his work reaching a new audience online, largely via the popular Instagram account Middle East Archive. Founded by Romaisa Baddar, MEA reposts historical images of the region, and has just released its debut photography book, comprising Elkoury\u2019s shots of Oman, Palestine, Egypt and Lebanon from 1980 to 1997. \u201cWhen Romaisa approached me, I told her I didn\u2019t have much energy,\u201d says Elkoury. \u201cFor two months after the explosion, I couldn\u2019t do anything because I was so traumatised. I would rather stay alone and think for myself than be on Instagram looking at pictures of what people are eating.\u201d Yet Baddar persisted and Elkoury finally relented. The result is an intriguing collection of Elkoury\u2019s lesser-known, optimistic work, from a horse rider in the middle of a busy road talking with someone through a car window (Jerusalem, 1993), to a man in a coat leaping wildly in a bid to stop a kid from scoring a goal during an impromptu football match (Gaza, 1994). The book, also called Middle East Archive, is full of this quiet poetry of everyday life: no matter the geopolitical context, Elkoury is saying, kids still play football. Is that the winning ball of the match? We will never know.\nThe book, explains Baddar, is intended as a corrective for the usual depictions of the Middle East. \u201cThe Arab world has been framed mainly through suffering, when that is not all these places stand for,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to show the region in its true essence and Instagram is a place where me and a lot of people of my age get informed. So it felt important to display something far more joyous than what you would see if you just Google the Middle East.\u201d Elkoury does not, however, see his work as a mere journalistic documentation. \u201cIf my images just show the event happening in front of me,\u201d he says, \u201cthe meaning of it will die when the event dies. For my pictures to be preserved in time, they had to be more symbolic.\u201d Shooting his first images with a camera pilfered from his father\u2019s desk drawer at the age of six, Elkoury took a circuitous route into professional photography, initially becoming an architect. But a return to Beirut in 1979 coincided with the chaos of the civil war and he began photographing his surroundings again. \u201cThe war was raging and there was nothing else to do but take pictures,\u201d he says. \u201cI was scared of the conflict so, rather than head to the frontlines, I concentrated on what constituted life during the war.\u201d\nThis focus on the personal in a time of massive upheaval is a recurring theme in his work, most notably in his 2006 series On War and Love. Here, text is written directly on to his images of unmade beds, bathroom mirrors and sunlit walls, creating a startling combination of a diaristic account of a breakup with the ongoing conflict in Beirut. Just as his lover is absent from the images, so are the usual bombastic depictions of war. That series formed part of Lebanon\u2019s first pavilion at the 2007 Venice Biennale, where Elkoury again exhibited earlier this year with a new series accompanying works by Lebanese-American poet and artist Etel Adnan. \u201cI\u2019m continually surprised by the fact that respectable museums want to display and purchase my work,\u201d Elkoury says. \u201cI photograph where I live and what I see and feel and there\u2019s not more to it.\u201d\nHis search for sincerity has seen Elkoury immersing himself in the places he has chosen to photograph. \u201cUsually when I travel to a country, I stay for some time \u2013 like in Palestine I stayed two and a half years. I don\u2019t travel for five days. I stay, I rent a house or flat and slowly get to know the atmosphere and the mentality of the city. It is interesting to immerse oneself in a country. But at the same time, it is quite a dangerous move because you often fall into things you didn\u2019t recognise.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that I\u2019m still alive. I could have died six or seven times, just being in places I shouldn\u2019t have been in.\u201d Elkoury shoots on film. Right now, there is a pile of rolls waiting to be taken to town and developed. The images they contain document a therapy of sorts, one he embarked upon after that fateful explosion last year. Those rolls record the walks he has been taking through the mountains around him. The act of taking these photographs \u2013 of returning to his craft \u2013 have aided his recovery. \u201cNature seems to be the only soothing element,\u201d he says. \u201cIt provides eternity.\u201d Middle East Archive is out now.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/01/fouad-elkoury-sunbathers-beirut-photographs-celebrating-everyday-life-middle-east", "last_update": "2021-10-29T15:04:48Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Cop trumps: how bad are emissions from key polluting countries?", "article": "As world leaders descend on Glasgow for vital United Nations Cop26 climate talks, seen as one of the last chances to prevent environmental breakdown, they will try their utmost to be seen to be taking action. But when it comes to the data, where do the biggest polluters really stand? To help get a clearer picture, the Guardian has created data profiles for individual countries, using the most recent available data from the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), IEA Statistics and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The information is broken down into five key categories: total greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emissions per capita, modern renewables share in final energy consumption, any current net zero target and CAT rating. At the top of the leaderboard for total emissions is China, which is rated \u201chighly insufficient\u201d by CAT, and has a net zero target of \u201cbefore 2060\u201d. And in second place is the US, which in 2019 emitted 19.77 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita of greenhouse gases. The UK, co-host of Cop26, is rated \u201calmost sufficient\u201d by CAT, but despite being home to the world\u2019s largest offshore wind energy market, in 2019 its renewable energy share was only 12.2% \u2013 considerably lower than the overall EU figure of 18.2% and far behind other European countries including the other co-host Italy (17.3%), Portugal (28.2%) and Norway (62.4%).

{"title": "The big idea: Is democracy up to the task of climate change?", "article": "It\u2019s time to acknowledge a difficult truth: our democracies are failing us on the climate crisis. As world leaders meet for the crucial Glasgow summit, rhetorical commitments abound. But no government has a plan compatible with the goal that they have all agreed is critical to our collective future: limiting global average temperature rises to 1.5C. In some democracies, such as the UK, there is at least a consensus that something must be done; in others, such as Australia, Canada and the US, political debate rages over the most fundamental questions. Faced with a problem of these proportions, some are running out of patience. The veteran Earth scientist James Lovelock puts his faith in eco-authoritarianism. Climate change is so severe, he has said, that \u201cit may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while\u201d. Lovelock may state this explicitly, but in my many years of work on climate policy and politics, I have been struck by how often people make the same argument implicitly. Bill Gates, in his breathlessly upbeat book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, describes how enlightened investment strategies from well-meaning entrepreneurs could save the day. No need to bother, he implies, with winning hearts, minds or votes. Then there are those who look approvingly towards China, a country where the very lack of democratic accountability, they argue, allows leaders to take tough and unpopular decisions. The common theme in all these accounts is that the public are not to be trusted \u2013 they do not understand, or care; they are too selfish, or too shortsighted. Better to let the experts decide.\nYet proposals for some sort of eco-authoritarianism raise more questions than they answer. How, exactly, do we move beyond democracy? Who appoints the experts? Scientists may have evidence at their disposal, but how would they make deeply social decisions about who wins and who loses? Under whose authority would they regulate, and how exactly would that regulation happen \u2013 how would laws be made? The best that can be said about these proposals is that they gloss over the complex realities of political, social and legal change. There\u2019s also the fact that authoritarian states have not performed better, historically. A recent study by the University of Gothenburg\u2019s V-Dem Institute showed that autocratic regimes lag significantly on climate action. Given the economic and political might of China, we have to hope that they find a way to buck this trend \u2013 but it would be reckless, not to mention ethically dubious, to suggest China as a political role model on climate. Despite the considerable flaws in our democratic systems, the alternatives crumble under any sort of close inspection. It is hard to disagree with Churchill\u2019s pithy summary that \u201cdemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others\u201d. My experience leads me to a very different conclusion to that of the eco-authoritarians. The data just doesn\u2019t support the picture of an uncaring or uninformed public. Research consistently shows high levels of concern about climate change, across different ages, demographic groups and parts of the world. Yet this concern is coupled with a deep mistrust in government and political elites, and a breakdown in the means by which people\u2019s priorities are translated into political action. To generalise, we have a population that is cynical yet concerned about the climate, frustrated with the inability of politicians to act decisively in the face of growing climate impacts.\nCould it be that the problem here is not too much democracy, but too little? What if we were to begin with the assumption that people can and do make sensible decisions if they have the evidence and the influence that they need? That if we designed a meaningful dialogue between citizens, experts and governments, we would get better outcomes? Just before Covid-19 struck last year, I was part of an incredible experiment that did just this. Climate Assembly UK was a citizens\u2019 assembly commissioned by parliament, bringing together a representative group of 108 citizens. Over a series of weekends, they learned about climate science, impacts and action; discussed and debated with experts and each other; and then voted on recommendations. The assembly\u2019s findings are a coherent, far-reaching set of proposals for tackling the climate emergency \u2013 created by a different sort of democratic body. Processes such as this aren\u2019t intended to replace our system of representative democracy, but to make it work better. They allow citizens and politicians alike to talk about what they need from each other. Citizens\u2019 assemblies on the climate crisis have now taken place in Scotland, France, Denmark and some US states, as well as at a local level in many areas. They show the potential of a move to a more deliberative democracy \u2013 one which goes beyond the blunt instrument of a vote, toward an informed conversation. But making democracy work better for the climate doesn\u2019t just mean hearing more from people. It means hearing less from those economic interests, such as oil majors and airlines, that have a stake in the high-carbon status quo. We\u2019ve recently seen corporations suing governments under trade law, claiming that climate policy, passed by democratically elected parliaments, has damaged their profits and is therefore illegal. US scientist Michael Mann has documented this \u201cnew climate war\u201d. He shows that denial of the scientific facts of climate change has been replaced with more complex, but equally insidious, attempts to delay or derail legislation. A key tactic, Mann shows, is to deflect attention away from the workings of big companies, and towards individuals, by saying that it is up to each of us to make the right choices, and reduce our carbon footprint. When this doesn\u2019t happen, it is a short step to blaming people for the state we are in, and undermining faith in the ability of democracies to handle the climate crisis. What is necessary, then, is not to dispense with democracy, but to double down on it. Seeing climate change not as something that can be solved by experts, nor through individual sacrifices \u2013 but by the negotiation of a new sort of social contract between people and the state. The novelist Amitav Ghosh refers to our current climate predicament as a \u201cgreat derangement\u201d, a collective reluctance to face up to the reality of how the crisis will affect our lives. Pretending that we can bypass people and democracy is, to my mind, the ultimate derangement. \u2022 Rebecca Willis is a professor of energy and climate governance at the University of Lancaster, and the author of Too Hot to Handle?

{"title": "Cop26: polling data is overwhelming \u2013 people want leaders to act", "article": "The world\u2019s nations meeting at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow are tasked with dramatically ramping up action to tackle the climate emergency. But do their citizens back them? And does the UK, as host, have a strong public mandate to act? The evidence from dozens of recent opinion polls is overwhelming: yes. So who is worried? Most people, everywhere: the biggest ever opinion poll on climate change, for the UN Development Programme, found two-thirds saying it is a \u201cglobal emergency\u201d. Across 50 countries, a majority in every one agreed. Both the young and the old agreed: 69% of those aged 14-18 and 58% of those over 60, indicating there is not a huge generational divide. Another large poll, for the BBC, showed most people (56%) across 31 nations want their governments to set stronger targets to address climate change as quickly as possible, with 36% backing more gradual action, and just 8% opposing action. In the UK, Ipsos Mori found that 80% of people think the climate crisis is a global emergency, with the same proportion blaming human activity. Concern is rising fast: between 2016 and 2020, the proportion of people very or extremely worried about climate change jumped from about 20% to almost 60% among UK citizens over 35 years old, with those younger going from 30% to 70%. \u201cThe UK government can take heart from the very strong levels of public support for the goals of the Cop26 summit,\u201d said Bridget Williams at Ipsos Mori. Across major European nations, anxiety about global heating is as high, or even higher than in the UK, YouGov polling shows.\nIs climate concern a worry that only the well-off can afford, as some opponents of climate action in the UK suggest? Absolutely not. A poll for Global Future found working class people are just as likely to be \u201chighly worried\u201d (43%) as the middle class (46%). The same poll did indicate a gender difference. For example, 40% of women said they had altered the food they ate to help combat climate change, compared with 27% of men. The UNDP poll also found significantly more women and girls were concerned about global heating in the UK, US, Australia and Canada, though not elsewhere.\nThose on the political left often report more climate concern than those on the right but, even in countries where climate change has become a very polarised issue, heavy majorities support action. In the US, for example, 75% of people support regulating CO2 as a pollutant, according to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. In the UK, work by WWF and Demos found levels of support for various climate actions changed little depending on party loyalty, as did polling for the New Economics Foundation. How worried are people? Climate change is the biggest concern for the public in the UK and Europe, ahead of Covid and the economy, according to recent research by SecNewgate, although it ranked significantly lower in the US, Australia and China. Another survey backed the high levels of concern in Europe, with 81% of EU citizens saying climate change was the biggest challenge humanity faces this century. A Yale poll found 66% of people in the US are worried about climate change. In the UK, most people (56%) believe that climate change will have a bigger impact on humanity than coronavirus, with the majority holding across all classes and genders, according to the polling by the Global Future. Britons do not think stark warnings about the climate crisis are alarmist: 69% say the threat is not exaggerated, found YouGov, compared to 17% who think it is. Other UK polls show climate change consistently ranking highly as an issue of concern, vying with the economy and health for the top spot.\nMore than half of UK citizens said \u201cdrastic action\u201d is needed, researchers at the Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (Cast) at Cardiff University found, with similar levels of concern in China and even higher levels in Brazil. \u201cAs world leaders discuss how they want to fulfil the international commitment to avoid the worst of the climate crisis, it is important to understand what citizens expect from their governments,\u201d said Katharine Steentjes at Cast. \u201cPolicymakers should note that citizens expect their governments to take responsibility and [implement] effective climate action.\u201d What action do people want? The UNDP poll, which surveyed over 1 million people around the world, found the most popular actions to tackle the climate crisis were protecting and restoring forests, renewable energy and climate-friendly farming. In nations where fossil fuels are a major part of the economy, people strongly supported renewable energy, including the US (65% in favour), Australia (76%) and Russia (51%). However, while 65% of Saudi Arabians believe there is a climate emergency, only 30% support stopping burning fossil fuels. Where the destruction of forests is a big cause of emissions, people supported conservation of trees, with 60% support in Brazil and 57% in Indonesia. In the UK, the biggest analysis of climate policy preferences ever published in UK, found backing for a carbon tax on polluting industries, higher levies on flying and grants for heat pumps. WWF and Demos asked 22,000 people to choose their favoured mix of policies to hit emissions cuts targets and they also supported a speed limit of 60mph on motorways and a campaign to reduce meat eating by 10%. All the policies had between 77% and 94% public support. Recent YouGov polls also recently asked Britons about climate action: when taking into account the costs and possible disruption, 84% supported subsidies to make houses more energy-efficient. An earlier YouGov/Sky Survey found 50% backed higher air taxes and banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2030. The UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics found that one in four people purchasing a new car in the next year said they would choose an electric or plug-in hybrid. Governments often shy away from action that targets people\u2019s behaviour, but a large survey across the UK and Europe for the European Investment Bank found more than 70% support for imposing changes on people\u2019s behaviour to fight climate change. \u201cThese demands from the public are a clear mandate to strengthen our efforts and accelerate the green transition,\u201d said EIB\u2019s Ambroise Fayolle. Even in the US, 60% say they are willing to drive and fly less, or already do, and 51% to eat less meat. But don\u2019t most people object when action, such as a wind farm, is planned in their backyard? The polling indicates not. Renewable energy is popular \u2013 79% support in a UK government poll. Another poll, in the UK and nine European countries, found 67% of people supportive of the construction of an onshore wind farm near to where they live, even in rural areas. In contrast 65% of Europeans would oppose the construction of a new nuclear power station near their home. A separate poll found those already living within five miles of a windfarm were just as supportive (70%) as those who did not. Cutting meat consumption in rich nations is vital to beating the climate emergency but is seen as one of the most controversial policies. However, in the UK, 70% of people agree they should definitely or probably do eat less meat, according to data from the Centre For Climate Change And Social Transformations, and Britons have already cut down by 17% in the last decade. Nonetheless, the promotion of plant-based diets was the least popular of the 18 policies in the global UNDP survey, with only 30% support, and the idea of a higher taxes on meat was last in a UK Ipsos Mori poll of eight policies, albeit with 47% support. Other research has shown that 80% of people in the UK and US would be open to eating meat grown from cells in a factory. Another idea seen as controversial is taxing motorists per mile that they drive. This has been proposed in the UK as one way of replacing the \u00a337bn-a-year tax revenue from petrol and diesel sales as more people take up electric cars. But a survey for the Social Market Foundation found 40% in favour, with 26% opposed. But what about the cost of action? The UK public is much more worried about the costs of inaction on climate change, according to Opinium polling, rather than the costs of action. More than half (55%) said we can\u2019t afford not to implement climate change policies, compared with 21% saying that is unaffordable. \u201cYou still need funding to reduce up-front costs, but the view that normal voters won\u2019t wear action on climate belongs to 2001 not 2021,\u201d said the pollster Steve Akehurst. Almost three-quarters (72%) of Britons say green products are too expensive for those on lower incomes, according to an Ipsos Mori poll. But they also think those people should be protected. The consensus of the 22,000 people participating in the WWF-Demos work was a suite of policies leaving people earning under \u00a322,000 a year better off, thanks to redistribution of a carbon tax and savings on heating and car bills. Tax rises to fight climate change found support in a Savanta ComRes poll, with 67% of UK citizens saying that would be acceptable, and only 22% saying the reverse.\nJust over half of UK people (51%) believe the household cost of tackling global heating will be larger than any savings from things like lower heating and petrol bills over one year, but they expect the trade-off to be more favourable in 10 years\u2019 time. \u201cBritons seem to be prepared for hair shirts. They just don\u2019t want to wear them forever,\u201d the Economist concluded. Who has the most responsibility for fixing climate change? In the UK, 34% put the most responsibility on the government, compared with the general public (26%) and businesses (19%), according to the government\u2019s own data. But YouGov polling shows only 13% of people think politicians are genuinely interested in tackling the climate emergency. Instead, most thought politicians were only trying to maintain a positive public image for themselves (68%). Surveys in the UK and nine other European countries found only 18% of people thought their government was doing \u201call they realistically can to tackle climate change\u201d. Another large European survey found 58% believing their country would fail to drastically reduce its CO2 emissions by 2050. There is strong support for the Cop26 goals among UK citizens, according to Ipsos Mori research, but low confidence that the government will deliver on climate. Over half (55%) are not confident that the government will take the actions needed in the next few years, compared with 40% that are confident. What can we conclude? In summary, there is strong and widespread support for climate action and equally strong scepticism that governments will fail to deliver. The opportunity for leaders at Cop26 is, therefore, to confound people\u2019s expectations and give them what they want. \u201cThe voice of the people is clear \u2013 they want action on climate change,\u201d said Cassie Flynn at the UNDP.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-polling-data-is-overwhelming-people-want-leaders-to-act", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:59:49Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Observant Eddie Jones feels at home being England\u2019s outsider | Simon Mundie", "article": "Eddie Jones has always felt like an outsider, and still does. \u201cAn Australian coaching in England rugby,\u201d the England rugby head coach tells me in the latest episode of Life Lessons: From Sport and Beyond. \u201cIn Japan, half-Japanese \u2013 you\u2019re an outsider.\u201d Born in Tasmania to a Japanese-American mother and Australian father, as a boy he lived in La Perouse, a south-eastern Sydney suburb. There were around 30 children in his school class. \u201cTwenty-six Anglo-Saxons, three aboriginal kids and myself.\u201d Jones\u2019s mother would make him take presents whenever he visited someone else\u2019s house, a Japanese custom he found uncomfortable. \u201cOther people could never understand why that was done. So, you were different.\u201d\nGrowing up feeling like an odd-man-out helped to shape Jones\u2019s eventual career choices. \u201cI wanted to be good at sport, because I wanted to be part of something.\u201d Rugby was his ticket in. While he was not physically imposing \u2013 estimates of Jones\u2019s height vary from 5ft 3in to a somewhat unlikely 5ft 8in \u2013 he had other skills, including a talent for sledging. \u201cI would be quite fast with my lip, so there was a role for me to play in the team.\u201d While Jones played against the British & Irish Lions for New South Wales B in 1989, he never made it into Australia\u2019s first team. Some have suggested that was a chastening experience that left a mark and a point to prove. As a coach, he has led teams to two Rugby World Cup finals, the first with Australia in 2003, when his side were pipped by Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s England. \u201cThat defeat was easier to take than 2019 [when England lost against South Africa],\u201d Jones admits, adding that, while he doesn\u2019t like to lose, \u201cif we played close to our best and got beaten that would have been easier to accept.\u201d As a leader, Jones prides himself on his observational skills, which he admits were borne of that feeling of not quite fitting in while growing up. That prompts the question, what has he observed about English culture that surprises him? \u201cHow complicated and complex it is, and I\u2019m still trying to work it out,\u201d he says. \u201cEngland has a history as a colonial power, and now people are trying to dissociate themselves from that. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a small-island mentality. And I see that in Japan as well, where people don\u2019t want to offend each other. They really want to get on and sometimes, that can make relationships quite difficult because it\u2019s harder for people to be honest. And the thing that strikes me is how often English people say, \u2018to be honest\u2019 or \u2018to be fair\u2019. Why? What else would you be? \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to be polite and fit in with what\u2019s going on in the moment. Until alcohol comes into it. Alcohol has a remarkable change on behaviour here, more so than even [with] Australians.\u201d Having spent time coaching and living in Australia, Japan, and England, Jones believes there is one Japanese habit that could enrich English culture. \u201cOne of the customs I really like in Japan \u2013 and my [Japanese] wife\u2019s really big on it \u2013 is that wherever you go, you have got to leave that area better than it was. It\u2019s such a harmonious and simple thing to do that\u2019s better for society. If you go to a park, don\u2019t leave it in worse condition. Leave it in a better condition.\u201d\nWhen Jones was first given the England job, there were some who said he would be a short\u2011term appointment; the sort of person to get quick results before burning out. Jones has been there nearly six years now, through ups and downs including the dismal fifth\u2011place finish in the Six Nations last season. His hardline methods have been controversial and at times divisive, and there has been high turnover rate among the coaching staff. But Jones insists he wants his players to know he cares about them, and that he\u2019s trying to move them \u2013 and subsequently the team \u2013 to a better place, via an \u201carm around the shoulder\u201d or \u201ca couple of tough words\u201d. Jones has also been quick to dispense with the services of several stalwarts who have served him well throughout his English tenure. Several big names have been cast aside for the autumn internationals including the Vunipola brothers Billy and Mako, George Ford and Jamie George. A new generation featuring players such as Marcus Smith, Louis Lynagh and Sam Simmonds have been given the opportunity to spearhead Jones\u2019s next crack at the World Cup. When asked recently to nominate his top five career moments, Jones left one place clear for the 2023 World Cup final in France. He has confirmed he will stand down after that tournament, by which time he will have been the country\u2019s longest\u2011serving head coach. Jones insists his priority is to ensure England are better off than when he was brought in. \u201cThe main thing for me is how I leave England. I want to make sure I leave England always thinking they should be top three in the world. That will be a job well done.\u201d When I point out how that chimes in with the Japanese trait of seeking to leave a place better off that when you arrived, Jones pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually thought about it like that. But that\u2019s true.\u201d \u2022 Simon Mundie hosts the Life Lessons: From Sport and Beyond podcast, available to download on all major podcast platforms.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/nov/01/observant-eddie-jones-feels-at-home-being-englands-outsider", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:24:34Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Bengals were flying high until we witnessed the Miracle Of Mike White", "article": "When the New York Jets needed one yard with two minutes left to secure a stunning 34-31 upset over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, the football stayed in Mike White\u2019s hands. It had to. White\u2019s successful quarterback sneak was the perfect ending to a game that showcased how nothing in the NFL is certain. Two weeks ago, very few people outside of the Jets universe had even heard of White \u2013 quite frankly, I kept envisioning the former Raiders head coach. White erased any confusion over his identity with a brilliant performance, especially as far as Jets quarterbacks go. His 405 passing yards were the most by a Jets quarterback in 327 games. That dates back to the year 2000. His 37 completions (out of 45 attempts) are an NFL record for a player in his first start. White also tied Cam Newton as the only player to top 400 passing yards in his first start. White also magically brought the Jets back from a 10-point deficit on two separate occasions, including during the fourth quarter. And executed a Philly Special two-point conversion to give the Jets the late, decisive three-point lead.\nThe fairytale of a player like White coming out of nowhere is why, despite its many troubles, the NFL continues to draw us in. White was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round of the 2018 draft. He lost a battle for the backup job behind Dak Prescott and was waived in 2019 when the team decided to carry just two quarterbacks. Then the Jets swooped in and signed White, though it\u2019s been a rocky relationship. Since 2019, White has been cut four times, and signed and waived and re-signed and moved to the active roster 11 times. White\u2019s performance led to the home fans at MetLife chanting his name. For now, the 26-year-old should enjoy the adulation \u2013 because the NFL has only a few examples of quarterbacks emerging from obscurity to sustained success. Kurt Warner famously quit football and stocked shelves at a grocery store when he was waived by the Packers before what would be a Hall of Fame career. But what makes Warner\u2019s story so compelling is that it is the exception rather than the rule. Whatever White\u2019s long-term merits turn out to be, the fact that he beat a team that were competing for the AFC No 1 seed heading into the weekend raises a serious question. How can the Jets go back to Zach Wilson, currently sidelined by injury? The Jets, of course, drafted Wilson as the No 2 overall pick this spring with the idea that he would be their quarterback of the future (and the present). While it\u2019s still very early in Wilson\u2019s career, it\u2019s safe to say no one in Canton is thinking about fitting him for a gold jacket any time soon: he currently sits 32 out of 33 eligible quarterbacks in ESPN\u2019s QBR rankings. Jets head coach Robert Saleh told reporters after the game that White will start for the Jets against the Colts on Thursday night. More telling, when asked if White could be the long-term solution at quarterback, Saleh replied: \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d Perhaps Saleh was merely caught up in the revelry after a resounding win and will need to backtrack for the sake of Wilson\u2019s psyche. Or maybe White really did make the first step to winning the starter\u2019s job on Sunday. Because, as he showed us, anything is possible in this league. MVP of the week\nMatthew Stafford, quarterback, Los Angeles Rams. Stafford continues to thrive under center on a Rams team overflowing with weapons and strong coaching. In Sunday\u2019s 38-22 win over the Texans (which was much more of a blowout than the final score suggests), Stafford was nearly flawless with 305 yards and three passing touchdowns (without playing in the fourth quarter). It\u2019s not just the great system Stafford entered, it\u2019s his command of a complicated offense and his elite ability to read defenses. Exhibit A: By the end of the first quarter, Stafford had already surpassed Jared Goff\u2019s touchdown total for the Rams last season. Video of the week Best Broncos pass of the season? Peyton Manning, who was inducted in the Broncos Ring of Honor on Sunday, showed he still has some life left in that arm after all.\nStat of the week This week it was revealed that Dallas Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb has been fined by the NFL a whopping FIVE times in six games this season. That might lead you to conclude that Lamb has serious behavioral issues. But Lamb\u2019s egregious crimes include: Having his jersey untucked ($5,510 v the Eagles; $15,450 v the Panthers). Failing to have his socks cover his lower leg ($5,510 v the Bucs in the season opener). Waving after his game-winning touchdown ($10,300 v the Patriots). Lamb was also fined for an illegal crackback block which, OK, is a fair penalty. But everything else? The NFL is loaded with examples of greed, but none may be more so than its list of fines. The pettiness of the league\u2019s attempts to strip players of their individuality has been known for a while but seeing it manifest in fines like Lamb\u2019s is a reminder of the ickiness. Quote of the week \u201cI need to step away from football at this time and focus on my mental wellbeing\u201d \u2013 Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley. Ridley\u2019s heartfelt explanation of his absence is the latest in a string of athletes being open about their mental health struggles. Just before Ridley released this statement, the NFL on Fox aired a riveting segment with Eagles tackle Lane Johnson about what it\u2019s like to live with anxiety and depression. The more we see athletes as humans, the better. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 Trevor Siemian\u2019s Saints beat Tom Brady\u2019s Buccaneers 36-27. Let that simmer for a moment. Siemian hadn\u2019t played since 2019. He beat Brady \u2013 Tom Freaking Brady \u2013 who has played almost nonstop for around 472 years. In fairness Siemian, who entered the game in the second quarter when Jameis Winston was injured, wasn\u2019t as critical to the Saints\u2019 win as White was for the Jets. But he played well enough in a tough situation, with 159 passing yards and a touchdown. It was the Bucs and Brady who shot themselves in the foot throughout. They committed 11 penalties (to the Saints\u2019 two) including a taunting call on Devin White on third-down deep in the final quarter that kept the Saints alive and led to a go-ahead field goal. For his part, Brady lost a fumble and threw two interceptions, including a pick six that sealed the game for New Orleans.\n\u2022 Back to that Winston injury. It sounds like he could be out for a while. \u201cI cried when I saw him coming in,\u201d said Saints head coach Sean Payton. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d The injury came after a horse-collar tackle from former teammate Devin White. \u201cI hate that this happened to you, man,\u201d White told Winston after the injury. \u201cBecause you\u2019re playing good ball and just praying for you.\u201d \u2022 More backup quarterback heroics in Minnesota. Where Cooper Rush stepped in for the injured Dak Prescott and led the Dallas Cowboys to victory over the Vikings. Rush threw for 325 yards and led an impressive touchdown drive late in the game to secure a 20-16 victory. The Cowboys are now 6-1 this season and firmly in control of the NFC East. \u2022 Both San Francisco and Chicago entered Sunday with major questions at quarterback. The 49ers won 33-22, which doesn\u2019t greatly matter since neither of these teams are shaping up as playoff contenders. But both Jimmy Garoppolo and Justin Fields gave performances that should please each fanbase. Garoppolo was efficient, decisive, and accurate. He ended the day with a very clean 322 passing yards (171 of which were to Deebo Samuel) and no turnovers. Even in a loss, this game may have been more monumental for Fields, who finally showed us his dynamic playmaking skills. Entering Sunday, the Bears had only designed eight run plays for Fields. Against San Francisco, Fields was let loose. He rushed for 103 yards and a score (on top of 175 passing yards). And in what felt like his true welcome to the NFL moment, Fields showcased his athleticism and instincts on an incredible touchdown run.\n\u2022 It was another tough day for anyone trying to understand the roughing the passer rule. Every week, without exception, there are flags thrown on questionable calls. A defender rolling over a quarterback to avoid his head. Or giving him a light shove to avoid deeper contact. Sunday saw some of the inverse, the non-calls. There was a very late hit on Mac Jones that was allowed to fly. More egregiously, Steelers kicker Chris Boswell, who had become a passer on a fake field-goal, was demolished by Browns DE Jordan Elliott on a clear roughing the passer that went unpenalized. Boswell had to go to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. Let\u2019s please get some consistency. \u2022 Jaguars head coach (for now) Urban Meyer really said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d after one of the biggest coaching shitshows you\u2019ll ever see in the NFL. Among the highlights of the Jags\u2019 31-7 loss to the Seahawks were consecutive penalties for 12 men of the field. And when his team finally scored with less than two minutes remaining, Meyer kicked an extra point that was followed by an onside kick. Does he want to win or not?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/mike-white-new-york-jets-quarterback-nfl-football", "last_update": "2021-11-01T11:29:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018We didn\u2019t deface the Eiffel Tower\u2019: Barnaby Joyce dismisses French anger at axed submarine deal", "article": "Australia\u2019s acting prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has dismissed the diplomatic row over the scrapping of the French submarine contract by declaring: \u201cWe didn\u2019t deface the Eiffel Tower.\u201d Other members of the Coalition also played down the fallout, saying Australia\u2019s actions were not as bad as \u201ccheating on a lover\u201d. They made the comments hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, criticised Australia\u2019s handling of plans to end the French contract and instead partner with the US and the UK to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines.\nAsked whether he thought the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had lied in the lead-up to announcement, Macron told reporters in Rome: \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know.\u201d Morrison later denied Macron\u2019s claim, telling reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d Joyce, the leader of the Nationals and acting prime minister while Morrison is overseas, implicitly accused France of overreacting to the cancellation of the $90bn deal, saying contracts had terms and conditions that allowed for an exit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t steal an island; we didn\u2019t deface the Eiffel Tower,\u201d Joyce said. Joyce said he understood the French sentiment, but he was \u201ccertain that with time, like all things, we can get over this and move on\u201d. Matt Canavan, a backbench senator from the same party told ABC TV: \u201cWe have not cheated on a lover here or somehow requested a divorce, we have changed a business arrangement and done so in the best interest of our country.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nWhile Joyce and Canavan attempted to minimise the significance of Australia\u2019s decision, the Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, took a step towards repairing the relationship with France. On Monday Payne met for more than an hour with the French ambassador, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault, who returned to Canberra after being recalled to Paris for consultations at the height of the diplomatic crisis. When he left Canberra in September, Th\u00e9bault told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe thought we were mates and we were stabbed in the back.\u201d Payne said Monday\u2019s in-person meeting was \u201cconstructive\u201d and added that Australia was \u201cfocused on moving forward in our relationship with France\u201d. \u201cThis is another important step in that process, building on discussions between our countries\u2019 leaders,\u201d Payne said. \u201cAustralia looks forward to regular engagement continuing.\u201d Th\u00e9bault has yet to comment on the outcome of the meeting, but he is scheduled to address the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, welcomed the meeting, but said Payne\u2019s efforts would be \u201cundermined and damaged by what the prime minister has done and how he is now dealing with it\u201d. \u201cIt is unprecedented to see a world leader so bluntly assert that we are led by a man whose word he doesn\u2019t trust,\u201d Wong told ABC TV.\nWong said France was an important power in the Indo-Pacific and Macron would take a leadership role in the EU after the retirement of German chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the Australian government should have ensured it managed the issue in a way \u201cthat minimises disruption to our relationship with France\u201d, adding: \u201cOn what possible planet is a good idea for us to have a stoush with them?\u201d The Labor senator Kristina Keneally told Sky News that Joyce was \u201cnot exactly helping here\u201d and asked: \u201cAre there any adults in this government? I mean, come on!\u201d The dispute with France dominated Morrison\u2019s trip to Rome for the G20 summit. Shortly after Morrison arrived in Italy, US president Joe Biden moved to repair his own damaged personal and political relationship with Macron by acknowledging that the Aukus announcement had been a \u201cclumsy\u201d episode handled with a lack of grace. Biden told Macron with television cameras present that he was \u201cunder the impression that France had been informed\u201d about Australia\u2019s intention to ditch the contract \u201clong before\u201d the Aukus partnership was revealed publicly. Morrison denied he had lied to the French president. He said he had told Macron that he had formed the view that conventional submarines would not meet Australia\u2019s strategic interests when the two leaders met in Paris after a G7 summit in June. He said when the two had dined together at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in June, \u201cat that stage we had not concluded any other arrangements with any other parties\u201d. Morrison said he understood Macron\u2019s disappointment, but that he did not resile from the decision to abandon the French contract and proceed with the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the US and UK. He said doing otherwise would have elevated French disappointment above Australia\u2019s national interests. Macron expressed scepticism to Australian journalists that the Aukus nuclear submarines would arrive on schedule. He noted there was an 18-month review of the feasibility of the arrangement, and quipped: \u201cGood luck.\u201d Macron has told Morrison that Australia\u2019s decision was about more than the submarine contract. In a phone call last week, Macron said it was also a \u201cunilateral decision\u201d to scale back the French-Australian strategic partnership and \u201cbroke the relationship of trust\u201d. France has urged Australia to propose \u201ctangible actions\u201d to heal the diplomatic rift. At Senate estimates last week, the secretary of the defence department, Greg Moriarty, said there had been \u201ca number of engagements with French officials about our thinking about capability requirements\u201d but added: \u201cI did not discuss cancellation of the Attack programme with any French official prior to the night before [the announcement].\u201d Asked whether representatives of France\u2019s Naval Group were blindsided, Moriarty said: \u201cThey were surprised and disappointed \u2013 understandably.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/we-didnt-deface-the-eiffel-tower-barnaby-joyce-dismisses-french-anger-at-axed-submarine-deal", "last_update": "2021-11-01T07:00:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Not just because of the Rubik\u2019s cube, the iconic toy invented by Ern\u0151 Rubik in 1974, but also because of its long history of maths outreach. In 1894, Hungary staged the world\u2019s first maths competition for teenagers, four decades before one was held anywhere else. 1894 also saw the launch of K\u00f6MaL, a Hungarian maths journal for secondary school pupils full of problems and tips on how to solve them. Both the competition and the journal have been running continuously since then, with only brief hiatuses during the two world wars. This emphasis on developing young talent means that Hungarians are always coming up with puzzles designed to stimulate a love of mathematics. (It also explains why Hungary arguably produces, per capita, more top mathematicians than any other country.) I asked B\u00e9la Bajnok, a Hungarian who is now director of American Mathematics Competitions, a series of competitions involving 300,000 students in the US, whether he knew of any puzzles that originated in Hungary. The first thing he said that came to mind was the \u20183-D logic puzzle\u2019, a type of logic puzzle in which you work out the solution in a three dimensional box, rather than (as is the case with the standard version) in a two-dimensional grid. He said he had never seen this type of puzzle outside Hungary. Below are two examples he created. You could solve these using an extended two dimensional grid. It\u2019s more in the spirit of the question, however, to draw a three-dimensional one, like you are looking at three sides of a Rubik\u2019s Cube. 1. Date night Andy, Bill, Chris, and Daniel are out tonight with their dates, Emily, Fran, Gina, and Huong. We have the following information. 1. Andy will go to the opera 2. Bill will spend the evening with Emily, 3. Chris would not want to go out with Gina, 4. Fran will see a movie 5. Gina will attend a workshop. We also know that one couple will see an art exhibit. Who will go out with whom, and what will they do? 2. Condo conundrum When Mr and Mrs Verona opened the door to their condominium at 11am this morning, they saw a terrible sight: their beautiful home had been burgled. They called the police, who came over immediately. The upcoming investigation revealed the following. 1. There are six condominiums in the building, numbered 1 to 6, the Veronas owned #4. 2. The Veronas left their home at 6pm last night. 3. The night guard of the building, Mr. Safe, works from 6pm till 10am. 4. There were six visitors in the building during last night: Mr A. Bream, Miss F. Green, Mr R. Hill, Dr T. Smith, Miss T. Taylor, and Mr Z. White. They all visited one of the six condominiums, each a different one, some time between 6pm and midnight. Mr. Safe could not recall, however, who visited which place; but he was sure that none of them stayed longer than an hour. Furthermore, they all stayed during different hours; the first one between 6pm and 7pm, the second between 7pm and 8pm, and so on. 5. Mr Bream was at a huge party at the country club. He arrived there at 8pm and stayed till midnight. 6. Miss Green was also at the country club; she arrived at 9pm and left with Mr Bream. 7. Mr Hill could not provide any credible alibi for the night before. 8. Miss Taylor was at her home watering her front yard between 7.45pm and 9pm. Several of her neighbors saw her. 9. Mr White was at the party at the country club. He arrived at 7pm and left at 10pm but, surprisingly, he came back again at 11pm and stayed till after midnight. 10. No one could enter the condominium without going through the lobby where Mr. Safe was stationed. 11. None of Dr. Smith\u2019s, Miss Taylor\u2019s, or Mr White\u2019s fingerprints were found in condo #5. 12. Dr Smith could not have visited condos #1, #3, or #6. 13. Miss Green couldn\u2019t have visited condos #3 and #6. 14. Mr Safe recalled that shortly before 8pm a visitor left either condo #1 or #4. 15. Nobody entered condos #5 and #6 before 7pm. 16. A visitor arrived at 8pm, and entered condo #1, #3, or #6. 17. Nobody visited condos #2, #3, and #6 between 10pm and 11pm. Well, these were all the clues that the police investigation revealed during the first day of the investigation. Can they solve this terrible crime without further information? I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK time with the solutions. PLEASE NO SPOILERS Instead discuss your favourite Hungarians. UPDATE: To read the solutions click here. Thanks to B\u00e9la Bajnok for today\u2019s puzzles.

{"title": "\u2018The lights went out and the shooting started\u2019: #EndSars protesters find no justice one year on", "article": "In October last year, thousands of mainly young Nigerians took to the streets to protest against police abuses, particularly among the now-disbanded brutal special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police unit. \u2013 Yet the several protests across the country were brutally repressed. At least 12 people were killed in the #EndSars protests, according to Amnesty International, and dozens were injured, including at Lekki tollgate in Lagos on 20 October, where witnesses livestreamed soldiers shooting at protesters draped in or waving Nigerian flags. The army and Nigerian government continue to deny anybody was killed at Lekki tollgate, and atrocities at other demonstrations have scarcely been acknowledged. A year on, four young Nigerians present at the protests across Nigeria reflect on the brutality they suffered and witnessed. They describe how it changed them and how they now feel about their home country.\nAmaka Obi*, 30, living in the US I didn\u2019t see any of the shootings [at Lekki tollgate]. But I saw blood everywhere. It was unreal. And I heard screams, I heard people crying. And the gunshots. The only people that had guns were the military. After it happened, it was something that I tried not to think about, but the images, I just couldn\u2019t get them out of my head for months. That night, it started off OK. The military was kind of surrounding us. They had these machine guns. And they were shouting at us. But I didn\u2019t feel scared at that point. I thought there\u2019s no way they\u2019re ever going to do anything, there are hundreds of people around. It wasn\u2019t bright daylight, but it was light enough for people to see.\nBut then it got dark and the tollgate lights went out. I wasn\u2019t at the main entrance of the tollgate, I was a little further away, but I just heard screaming and running. People were shouting, \u201cthey\u2019re killing, they\u2019re killing\u201d. People were being pushed over and trampled. I was trying to find my friend because I didn\u2019t know what was happening and I was afraid. For at least a few days afterwards, I was in shock. I left Lagos immediately and went to Abuja, even though Abuja wasn\u2019t safe. During the protests, my mum was calling me every day begging me to leave, crying, and I didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t feel unsafe. But that was the first time I did. I left Nigeria within a week. And then I felt this guilt. I was privileged enough that I didn\u2019t have to be there. I have a blue passport [one of Nigeria\u2019s five types of passport, given to government officials], I could leave at any point, but my friends and everyone are still there.\nFor a while, I thought maybe it didn\u2019t happen. But then how can all of us remember the same thing? It did happen, it\u2019s just they [the government] denied it. That\u2019s the scary thing about the government. They can just gaslight you and tell you what happened isn\u2019t what happened. Then you feel crazy. I know I\u2019ll never go to another protest in Nigeria, because we can\u2019t protect ourselves. When I went back to Nigeria, it felt different to previous times. I love to travel a lot, I used to take a bus from Abuja to Lagos, but no way now. Ogechi Igbani, 32, from Abuja When the agitation started and conversations happened online, it gave me energy. I wanted to do something. That day [11 October], I got to Unity fountain. There were about 200 or 300 of us. The idea was to march to the police headquarters. We were singing our songs, and people were greeting us on the road. When we got to an intersection with two police armoured trucks, 30 or so people went towards them and knelt down. The police began firing teargas. Initially, we were standing our ground, but then gunshots started. We were running and they [the police] were chasing us. I thought, \u201cwow, I\u2019m going to die\u201d. But at the same time, in a weird way, I wasn\u2019t afraid. Some people ran into a bush to hide. I could have joined them but I thought, \u201cwhy am I running? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t commit any offence\u201d. So I just stopped.\nThere was a police van with seven to 10 policemen. Immediately they saw me, stopped and said: \u201cShebi, you\u2019re one of them?\u201d [Shebi is Yoruba term used for confirmation of a statement: \u201cis it not that?\u201d or \u201cyou agree?\u201d]. The officers that attacked me had guns and sticks, which were thick branches cut from trees.\nThe first person slapped me across the face. I fell to the ground. About four or five of them started hitting me with the sticks. I tried to cover my head. All I was thinking was, \u201cIf I can\u2019t do anything else, let me prevent them from hitting my head\u201d. And they asked, \u201cWho sent you? How much were you paid? Do you think you can protest? Who are you?\u201d. I can\u2019t even tell how long it lasted. Before then, I had not had encountered police brutality. But now I was seeing it for myself. And it wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t nice. It\u2019s not something that I would wish for anybody. It made me start thinking about how, one day, I\u2019m not going to be here any more. It made me think of things I would do or should do to make my society better. For me, it was like a reawakening. Now, I\u2019m part of a group of young people wanting to change the country for the better. I still believe in Nigeria and think while I\u2019m here I want to try to make things better. Isaiah Ekabo, 32, from Lagos I wanted to join the protests immediately as they began in Ajangbadi [a suburb of Lagos]. I was excited, the youths were protesting all over Nigeria, even around the world, outside embassies and everywhere. It was our time. I was thinking, \u201cyes, finally. Let\u2019s come together. Let\u2019s tell them that we\u2019ve had enough\u201d. The government, the police, they know what they put people through every day, so they can\u2019t tell us they were surprised. Harassment all the time, because your hair is one colour, or because of piercings, or dreads. Even without any of those things, they can stop you for any reason. But, instead of seeing us as citizens demanding our rights, look what they did?\nThe first day I joined, straight away, they [the police] were shooting. They didn\u2019t care at all. I know of two people who were killed. I was running and heard them shooting from behind me. One person running some distance in front of me suddenly collapsed. They shot him. I couldn\u2019t stop to check him, I just ran. Fearing for my life, I ran into a sidestreet. In Nigeria, in a so-called democracy, I was running from police who were trying to end my life, because of protests.\nI don\u2019t really think about the protests now. I don\u2019t give myself that opportunity. It\u2019s a painful period because our government showed itself. But this is not new, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve known it to be. Just to survive in Nigeria, it\u2019s too much. Everything is working against you. Be it no light, no roads, few jobs, bad water. Then, on top of that, we have to beg that the police don\u2019t harass or kill us. I studied architecture at university. I finished six years ago. Since then, I\u2019ve been working, doing different jobs that are OK, it\u2019s just not what I was hoping for. I have an uncle working in Norway. It\u2019s my prayer that I will join him after some time, either to find work or to continue university, because the situation here is too hard. Agbeze Ifeanyi Matthew, 35, from Ondo state\nOn 20 October, my friend, Olamide Gudo, and I left the protest at about noon. But when we got to Obalende [a neighbourhood in Lagos state], we were not able to get a bus home to Ikorodu. We were stranded. Some youths had taken over the area. So we thought, let\u2019s go back to Lekki tollgate, because that place is safer. We had been at the protest there and the atmosphere was very safe, like nothing I had ever seen before. People were giving speeches, singing, dancing, protesting. There was food around and drinks. At about 6.45pm, we heard that Nigerian soldiers were coming to the Lekki tollgate.\nThe tollgate lights had never gone off before, but when they turned them all off and we saw people [in uniform] removing the cameras, we became scared. What happened was the worst memory that I can never forget. When they [the army] got to the tollgate, they immediately started shooting. I was so shocked. Did this government send soldiers to come and kill innocent youths? It\u2019s our right to protest peacefully. Some of us sat down. I saw a military man \u2026 He shot me [in the chest].\nI ran away \u2026 but I was gradually getting weaker. There were so many people running, everywhere was dark. I thought if I carried on in that direction I was going to lose blood until I died, so I started to run back. And I heard two men say, \u201cthis guy has been shot\u201d. I fell to the ground. These young men took my picture, then they took me to the general hospital in Marina. The bullet had gone through my back. In the ambulance they were saying I had lost so much blood. The nurse was praying, trying to encourage me to be courageous, saying that I should not lose hope. This was around 1am. I was the first person from the tollgate admitted to the ward. By later that morning, there was no more space. To this day, Lai Mohammed [Nigeria\u2019s information minister], the army, the government, are telling us that nobody was killed at the Lekki tollgate. You can see how disgraceful they are. So what we saw with our eyes is a lie? Are these bullet wounds fake?

I did Gangsta\u2019s Paradise at a birthday party once. I felt so self-conscious, but you have to commit to that song, which I definitely did, as I was absolutely hammered. I don\u2019t think I could do it sober. *** The song I inexplicably know every lyric to My mother used to always put Barry Manilow on in the car, so I know all the words to Copacabana. The last stanza, all about how she used to be beautiful and now she\u2019s lonely and old and her lover has been shot dead, is really bleak and misogynistic! *** The last song I streamed Scratchcard Lanyard by a band called Dry Cleaning that my good pal Lolly Adefope got me into. They\u2019ve got an art school feel, almost spoken word. The lyrics are these little celebrations of banal, everyday things, and they\u2019re all delivered in a monotone. It\u2019s trying to do the opposite of entertaining you, which I really respect.\n*** The song I want played at my funeral Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 5: it\u2019s so emotive. I\u2019ve loved it ever since I first heard it, aged 16, on the soundtrack to Death in Venice, and became obsessed with it. Weirdly, I heard it at a funeral recently and, if anything, it confirmed: \u201cYeah, this is very powerful music!\u201d *** The song I pretend to like, but I secretly hate When I\u2019m writing, I can\u2019t listen to anything with lyrics, because it\u2019s too distracting. A friend recommended the soundtrack of The Master, but it was very invasive. Just really difficult to write to. So I told a white lie about liking it and went back to my cheesy three-hour-long YouTube compilations of instrumental Disney piano. It\u2019s naff, but it does the job.\n*** The song I can\u2019t help singing When I was about 15 and doing National Youth Theatre, we had to learn this incredible Georgian folk song called Tsintskaro. I don\u2019t even know what the words mean, but when I\u2019m in the shower, it\u2019s the tune that wants to come out. I\u2019d love to speak to a Georgian person to find out what it means! It\u2019s been haunting me all these years. *** The best song to have sex to I once accidentally had a threesome at university to the [hidden camera comedy show] Trigger Happy TV soundtrack. It has amazing tracks on it by bands like the Waterboys \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the Nokia tune on it! I remember suddenly becoming conscious of what we were listening to, and going: \u201cHave you seen Trigger Happy TV?\u201d, as if I was about to say: \u201cWell, guess what? You\u2019re on it!\u201d Katy Wix appears on Stath Lets Flats on Channel 4.

{"title": "The climate crisis explained in 10 charts", "article": "The problem: rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The level of CO2 has been rising since the Industrial Revolution and is now at its highest for about 4m years. The rate of the rise is even more striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we are in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d.\nThe causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. The slight reduction in 2020 due to coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a \u201ctiny blip\u201d in the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\nThe causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth.\nThe causes (III): farming Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and emissions are increasing faster now than at any time in 40 years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites are responsible.\nThe consequences: global temperature rise The planet\u2019s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.\nThe consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai.\nThe consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat, causing more heating \u2013 one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America.\nThe upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and tackle difficult sectors such as aviation and farming.\nThe upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream.\nThe upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating green hydrogen, will also be needed.\nSupport urgent, independent climate journalism Make a contribution from just \u00a31 Become a digital subscriber and get something in return for your money", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts", "last_update": "2021-10-21T15:13:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "It was a safe bet my money was stolen but TSB won\u2019t refund me", "article": "I am in a battle to get TSB to refund more than \u00a31,000 taken from my account by thieves, and I need some help. Two weeks ago I realised that several unknown debits had appeared on my current account over a two-day period. I immediately rang the TSB fraud helpline. While I was waiting on hold for three hours, I unilaterally cancelled my card, to be on the safe side. The bank has refunded a \u00a33 payment to Travelodge and a \u00a335 Just Eat order, but it has refused to refund 22 transactions at various betting sites including Bet365, Unibet, Betfair, Trannel International and Sky Bet \u2013 all for sums of between \u00a330 and \u00a340. I have never used any of these sites except Sky Bet, where I do hold an account. The bank\u2019s staff immediately refunded the \u00a33 and meal charges as \u201cthey could be seen to be fraudulent\u201d, but refused the others because they were deemed to be \u201cgambling\u201d. I was told to investigate myself and that TSB could not assist me in doing so. Many of these companies are offshore in Malta and elsewhere and I\u2019m at a loss where to start. I don\u2019t understand why the bank is making this distinction given that it accepts that my card has been compromised. The Financial Conduct Authority regulations clearly state that \u201cif you didn\u2019t authorise a payment, you can claim a refund\u201d. The disputed entries have since been changed so I can no longer see which vendors were even involved. SG, Southampton Last month an expert on fraud told me that TSB has the best record of the banks for refunding victims of fraud. Your case was all the more surprising given that it clearly accepted that you had been the victim of fraud, but declined to refund the sums spent on gambling sites. Clearly the thief was spending small sums to prevent any security flags being raised. You did the right thing in cancelling the card, and this probably saved you from further losses. I raised your case with TSB, and it now accepts that you did not authorise these payments. It has refunded you in full. It did so having looked into the \u201cadditional information provided by you and the betting companies\u201d. The bank has also offered \u00a3100 compensation.

{"title": "After 30 years of Cop, our ex-environment editor is now optimistic", "article": "In September 2006, shortly before the annual UN climate talks to be held that year in Nairobi, Kenya, I looked for hope amid the predictions of ecological collapse and the total failure of countries to act on emissions. It was hard going. The best I could manage was to argue that political, social and technological awareness of the climate crisis was growing and starting to translate into action. It was now a race between new ideas and political realities. A personal revolution was taking place, I wrote. \u201cSee how far we have [all] come in a generation \u2026 Have you thought about installing solar panels or bought renewable energy? Have you chosen not to take a plane or bought a less powerful car? Have you voted for a political party or an individual because of their record on the environment? Have you tried to recycle more? Have you linked heatwaves and hurricanes with climate change, or wondered what kind of physical world your children will inhabit?\u201d Yes, it was thin, but then it seemed unlikely that an oil-addicted, carbon-illiterate world could, or even wanted to, ditch fossil fuels. Hopelessness was rife. Net zero was on few agendas. Renewable wind and solar power barely registered, and disinformation by denier and free-market thinktanks had paralysed the debate. Even the most cautious predictions warned of climate change accelerating fast as populations and wealth grew, with more extreme and unpredictable weather, sea level rises, water and food shortages, and effects on biodiversity.\nI concluded: \u201cWithin most of our lifetimes there will be at least 2 billion more people \u2013 another China and a half \u2013 all being encouraged to consume as much oil, water, land, minerals, wood and stone as we in Britain do today. That will mean something like 1,000 times as many aeroplanes, 10 times as many cars and half as much food and water again being needed. Forget it. This will require several new planets.\u201d Worryingly, few people seemed to understand the scale of the catastrophe-in-waiting. That year, the Royal Society in London declared there was scientific consensus of man-made warming, the 692-page Stern review showed how it could lead to the greatest recession in history, and the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, told world leaders that those who questioned climate change were \u201cout of step, out of arguments and out of time\u201d.\nBut the media were barely interested enough to even send reporters to Nairobi, and it would be many years before the Murdoch empire, the BBC and even Channel 4 TV stopped giving equal air time to deniers. Even worse, despite climate being on the international agenda since 1992, the Kyoto protocol \u2013 the only binding global treaty that stipulated cuts in greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 had been in force for a year and then only obliged a handful of industrialised countries to cut emissions by 5.2% on 1990 figures. Meanwhile, the world\u2019s two largest emitters \u2013 China and the US \u2013 were not even signed up. 2006 was possibly the lowest point in attempts to get the world to reduce emissions. More than 6,000 diplomats and NGOs went to Cop12 in Nairobi in 2006 and saw the US, Australia and other countries delay and undermine progress. A modest last-minute consensus was scrabbled together to take forward a five-year \u201cplan of action\u201d that allowed the EU, US and other governments to congratulate themselves. The British environment secretary, David Miliband, returned from Africa to tell parliament that \u201cgood progress\u201d had been made. But to anyone outside the Cop bubble, progress had been negligible and ambition minimal. In truth, the talks were going at snail\u2019s pace and a few rich countries that had helped create the climate crisis had once more chosen not to act decisively, nor provide the technology or the finance for others to help themselves. In the words of Greta Thunberg in 2021, the climate talks were just \u201cblah, blah, blah\u201d.\nAnd most of those gloomy predictions have already become real. Since 2006, world population has grown 20%, or by more than 1 billion people. By 2050, it is expected to reach 9.7 billion, a 50% rise in just one generation. There are 500m more vehicles now than there were then and air passenger numbers have more than doubled. Instead of 1.2 billion people being affected by water shortages in 2005, there are now more than 3 billion. In that short time, too, CO2 emissions have risen nearly 23%, and the last decade has been the warmest on record. Meanwhile, many millions of people have died in natural disasters, there have been catastrophic fires, droughts, floods and heatwaves, and nature is in clear decline. How Rio changed the world Climate talks have been strained to breaking point since 1972 when the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm first put the issue on the international agenda. By 1992, when diplomats at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro started negotiating a treaty to cut emissions, the enmity between rich and poor nations was running deep. Nearly one in two people in heavily indebted Africa, Asia and Latin America were living in extreme poverty, while consumerism in the rich world was rampant. The north wanted to talk about the global atmosphere and the felling of forests in Brazil and Indonesia, but the rest of the world demanded they first talk about development and poverty. There was deep resentment at the inequalities and those gaps between countries have never fully closed. By the time the then UK prime minister, John Major, arrived at the Riocentro convention halls in June 1992, weeks after being unexpectedly elected, any hope that cuts could be negotiated had been dashed. With the favelas in lockdown and military helicopters thundering up and down Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, US negotiators were under orders to water down previously-agreed positions to reduce greenhouse gases, and flatly refused to sign a treaty to protect biodiversity.\nIt was the shape of things to come. The US \u2013 responsible for one quarter of the world\u2019s emissions \u2013 had decided there should be no binding targets or timetables for cuts, that only a paltry $75m should be given to the world\u2019s 4 billion poor to help them adapt, that action to cut emissions should be delayed for at least eight years and be voluntary. It got its way. Nevertheless, a weak climate convention was adopted and hailed by the rich world as a landmark agreement to save the planet. In truth it was almost meaningless and effectively ensured no action had to be taken for a decade. But in one respect Rio did change the world. As tens of thousands of local Cariocas joined western environmentalists, indigenous peoples, charities, women\u2019s and faith groups, poverty campaigners and youth, there was a real sense of an impatient global grassroots climate movement emerging, demanding action and giving a voice to nature as never before. Two short speeches \u2013 one political, one emotional \u2013 captured the Rio mood. The Cuban president, Fidel Castro, expressed the anger felt by the south at the rich countries\u2019 abuse of nature. \u201cAn important biological species \u2013 humankind \u2013 is at risk of disappearing due to the rapid and progressive elimination of its natural habitat. It must be said that consumer societies are chiefly responsible \u2026 They have poisoned the seas and the rivers. They have polluted the air. They have saturated the atmosphere with gases, altering climatic conditions with the catastrophic effects we are already beginning to suffer,\u201d he said to thunderous applause at the opening session, before ending: \u201cEnough of selfishness. Enough of schemes of domination. Enough of insensitivity, irresponsibility and deceit. Tomorrow will be too late to do what we should have done a long time ago.\u201d\nThe second speech came a few days later, from 1992\u2019s equivalent of Greta Thunberg. The 12-year-old Severn Suzuki, daughter of one of Canada\u2019s best-known environmentalists, shamed world leaders, saying: \u201cI am only a child, yet I know if all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental answers ending poverty and in finding treaties, what a wonderful place this Earth would be.\u201d A third speech is possibly apocryphal, but has been quoted widely and has came to define the direction of future climate talks. A combative George HW Bush, leader of the world\u2019s remaining superpower, flew to Rio on Air Force One for 24 hours and declared the US to be the world\u2019s leading environmental nation, reportedly adding that \u201cthe American way of life is not up for negotiation. Period.\u201d It was a reality check for optimists and from then on, the US was cast as the leading climate villain, a role it has played in most talks since. Unspectacular progress \u2026 until Paris In the 29 years since Rio, CO2 emissions have risen nearly 60% and are still rising, leaving some commentators to argue that the meetings are a circus, and because so few cuts have been made negotiations should be ditched in favour of radically different talks outside the UN process. The opposing argument is that blame for consistent failure should not be put on the complex, inclusive UN process, so much as the lack of political will from big emitters to act. Climate change is a global issue, so everyone must have a say and consensus via the UN is the last best hope to progress, it is said.\nBoth arguments have merit. The talks have indeed been marked by mistrust and rancour but also by extraordinary initiatives and great gatherings of civil society. All meetings since 2001 have run overtime, many ending at dawn with last-ditch compromises, brinkmanship and dramatic rescues from abject failure. Angela Merkel, the then 38-year-old German environment minister who chaired the first Conference of the parties (Cop1) in Berlin in 1995, is said to have single-handedly pushed through proposals for what would become the Kyoto protocol, the cornerstone of all international action on global warming. Two years later, John Prescott, the British environment secretary, is credited with taking charge at Kyoto in Japan and banging heads together to secure an agreement to bind developed countries to cuts of about 5% by 2012. Disaster loomed on the final night of Cop17 in 2011 in Durban until, in a moment of genius, the South African presidency employed a traditional African mediation technique known as an indaba to bring together opposing people in small huddles.\nThere have been villains, too. Bernarditas Muller, lead negotiator for China and the developing countries group, was widely disliked by western negotiators but admired by developing nations for her refusal to be bullied into watering down legal commitments. Al Gore, awarded the Nobel prize in 2007 for his work on climate, was the lead US negotiator in 1997 who demanded loopholes to allow rich countries to buy their cuts from poor countries, so evading the moral responsibility to act themselves. Saudi Arabia, Canada and Australia have all been accused regularly of trying to wreck, block or dilute commitments. But despite the dramas, most Cops since Berlin have only managed to grind out unspectacular progress. Cop6 in The Hague in 2001 failed to agree anything significant at all; Cop8 in Delhi may be remembered merely for agreeing to call for technology transfer; Cop11 in Canada just extended the life of the Kyoto protocol beyond 2012; Cop16 called for developing countries to be handed $100bn a year to adapt. The lowest point may have been in 2009 when Cop15 in Copenhagen descended into chaos and recrimination as rich countries were found negotiating secret deals. High points such as Cop21 in Paris in 2015, when a new treaty was signed binding all nations to make cuts, are very much the exception. The cause of a generation And yet. Despite the snail\u2019s pace and the failures, I am far more optimistic now than in 1992 or 2006. In the early climate talks, the science was a side issue for many countries and negotiations were a political battleground, with groups of like-minded countries playing out ideological agendas to maintain influence or economic domination. For years, the US, EU and UK splashed foreign aid to keep former colonies onside and tried to prevent China from growing its economy. Equally, China could \u201cbuy\u201d the support of countries with promises to invest in their economies. Now all governments have plans and self-interest today is redefined as rapid decarbonisation.\nIn just 15 years, too, there has been a renewable power revolution, led by solar and wind. Green hydrogen is now roughly where solar was in 1992, and battery storage technologies and marine power are developing fast. With China no longer funding foreign coal plants and electric car sales taking off, the end of fossil fuels is nearly in sight. It will not be enough to hold temperatures to a rise of 1.5C-2C, but the revolution has started. There are other reasons to be optimistic. Every country has now had a taste of climate change. Social media, too, has sharpened the world spotlight and leaders will not want to return from Glasgow empty-handed or be branded as climate laggards or wreckers. Money issues, so long a stumbling block in the talks, may now be resolved, too. Since Covid, which has already cost countries trillions of dollars, the $100bn a year pledged but not provided by rich countries in 2009 to help vulnerable countries adapt does not look that much. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero alone has brought together hundreds of the world\u2019s biggest banks and finance groups. To not find the money now would only make countries look cruel and self-destructive.\nAbove all, that global hunger for action, which I first saw expressed in Rio 29 years ago, is now insatiable. The fight for the climate has become the cause of a generation, joined by worldwide movements of youth, indigenous peoples, faith and justice groups, businesses and local governments. Climate now embraces science, human rights, health, environmental justice, race, gender and equity. The arguments have been won, the science is certain, the solutions found, and people want progress. There\u2019s still far to go, but the future is not set in stone as it appeared to be in 2006 \u2013 the old walls of doubt are crumbling, the momentum is building and there will be no going back from Glasgow.

{"title": "Growing Up by Peter Doggett review \u2013 the seamy underbelly of free love", "article": "In 1964, Germaine Greer arrived in Cambridge from Australia to study for a PhD in English Literature. The subject of her thesis was love and marriage in Shakespeare\u2019s early comedies, but in truth, Petruchio and co were not her only preoccupations. Cambridge, with its large population of men in what she described as \u201cthe full flower of their potency\u201d, seemed to Greer to be \u201can ideal spot for the dedicated practitioner of the arts of love\u201d. By her own admission, she was elated at what she saw as \u201cthe vastness\u201d of the opportunity for \u201cproselytising\u201d. But, alas, the male fleshpots of Cambridge \u2013 otherwise known, I assume, as pubs \u2013 turned out to be a disappointment: \u201cFor six months after I arrived, the only sex I experienced directly, apart from endlessly repeated discussions in which I found it necessary to explain that there had been improvements upon coitus interruptus as a contraceptive method \u2026 was the sight of three grubby, scrawny men in their 40s, who derived some satisfaction from exposing to me their genitals, pallid and bluish in the frosty air.\u201d If she were to \u201cinfiltrate the wilds of Bohemia\u201d, she realised, she would have to travel to London, where the sexual menu was altogether more \u201cpromising\u201d \u2013 and where, having chosen from it freely, she would eventually publish an article in Richard Neville\u2019s underground magazine, Oz, called In Bed With the English.\nIt probably goes without saying that Greer was a swashbuckler; her bravado, which would endure long after the 60s ended, should always be taken with a pinch of salt. But still, this story of corduroy trousers, unyielding even in the face of so much antipodean determination, illustrates rather neatly the difference between perceptions of the 60s and reality \u2013 a yawning gap that Peter Doggett makes the most of in Growing Up: Sex in the Sixties, his fascinating but deeply strange new book about the decade. As he notes, the montages so beloved of TV documentary-makers \u2013 the fuzzy clips of gyrating hippies with flowers in their hair \u2013 don\u2019t tell even half the story. Decades are not neat. Just as the 60s would not really get going for most people until some time in 1975 (at least), the 50s hung about like a bad smell long after 1960. The so-called revolution walked hand in hand with something altogether more repressive: a backwards tug that enabled the old double standards so far as men and women go not just to survive, but to thrive. In the same year that Greer found herself explaining birth control to bearded men in polo necks, the designer Rudi Gernreich unveiled his \u201cmonokini\u201d, a swimsuit that left the breasts uncovered. Bare breasts were, seemingly, all the rage; in the Daily Mirror, Marjorie Proops informed her readers that \u2013 good news! \u2013 Carnegie Models\u2019 topless crepe dress had already been ordered by more than one London store. But really, who was ever going to wear such things? As a reader of Tit-Bits (not as naughty as it sounds) put it: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t show my figure to anyone \u2013 not even my husband.\u201d Swerving the obvious territory of the Chatterley trial and the Profumo scandal, Doggett sets out to show that in 60s Britain, most radical concepts were only notional, the revealing of too much flesh to the world among them.\nHe doesn\u2019t buy, or not wholeheartedly, the liberation that came, for women, with the pill, legalised abortion and (yes) tights. The sexual revolution was, he believes, a smokescreen for a more problematic and enduring change, one that objectified women\u2019s bodies like never before, establishing underage girls in particular as legitimate subjects of adult desire (he traces this back, in part, to Nabokov\u2019s Lolita, Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film of which was released in 1962). If \u201cfilth\u201d of the kind that Mary Whitehouse made it her mission to outlaw seems quaint now \u2013 an innocent BBC comedy drama called Swizzlewick, set in a fictional Midlands town, shrivelled and died when she objected to it \u2013 life for many women in the 60s must still have felt, at moments, pretty unbearable. Doggett\u2019s speciality in Growing Up is to provide detailed accounts of court cases involving sexual assault and murder where the male offender inevitably gets off with little more than rapped knuckles, though, as he also makes clear, such attitudes were hardly restricted to stodgy judges and juries. The liberal intelligentsia was just as bad. In films such as Alfie, A Kind of Loving and Room at the Top, sex inevitably spells doom \u2013 for women at least. The philosophy espoused by Emmanuel Petrakis, which had it that men are pre-eminent, and women there to serve them, was particularly prevalent in the 60s underground. It has to be said that the reader of Growing Up must plough through some quite peculiar and gratuitous stuff: on our behalf, he has (making like Kate Millet, only without the theory) reread John Updike\u2019s 1968 novel Couples, with its lavish descriptions of \u201civory rods\u201d, and even Leslie Thomas\u2019s ghastly bestseller, The Virgin Soldiers. But I think, in the end, that I\u2019m prepared to forgive its author these strange interludes. He understands, better than many, that half of the human race is still paying the price for the insurgency that started, and then stalled, in this period. \u201cIf it were possible at this moment for women to take their masochism and radicalise it, there would be the bloodiest revolution ever,\u201d said Jane Arden, whose play, Vagina Rex, was staged in London in 1969. In Growing Up, women\u2019s suffering can be found on almost every page, the new, guilt-free lives they\u2019ve read about only ever, for them, a chimera. \u2022 Growing Up: Sex in the Sixties by Peter Doggett is published by Vintage (\u00a325).

The standing area here at the UK\u2019s largest freefall abseil is narrow, and feels like the crow\u2019s nest of a ship. The sunny day has clouded over. It\u2019s gusty, 80 metres (262ft) in the air. Two wind-buffeted safety crew, Sian and Jack, hook me to ropes. My life is in their hands, and I don\u2019t even know their surnames. Looking out over the head-spinning edge, I feel afraid. In a few seconds I\u2019ll be descending unsupported but for a rope, from almost the height of the Statue of Liberty. To give me \u201cmy full Zen moment\u201d I won\u2019t have an instructor with me. I\u2019ll be alone. The building itself lends a trippy, out-of-your-head element to this. Sir Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond\u2019s sculptural oddity looks like a tentacle enveloping a can of Spam, or a pulled-apart Slinky. Does Kapoor know thrill-seekers are walking all over it from the outside? Is this what he wanted? I didn\u2019t know people were allowed to do this, and wish they weren\u2019t so I wouldn\u2019t have to. It feels like tempting fate. What kind of people do this? And why? \u201cIt\u2019s urban exploring \u2013 seeing London from a new angle,\u201d said Max earlier, as we gazed up at the disorienting loops from ground level, the sky still blue. Max works for Wire & Sky, which runs urban aerial adventures, in which anyone can traverse recognisable landmarks such as the O2 in Greenwich, or Brighton\u2019s i360, in terrifying new ways. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating to conquer fear. Makes you feel alive,\u201d he says. Maybe. Waddling in my punishingly tight harness, festooned in carabiners and clanking like a discordant bell, I sound more like Jacob Marley\u2019s ghost.\nThen again, life can be a gift. A group of abseilers here today are raising money for Keech, a children\u2019s hospice in Bedfordshire. My harness helper Fran tells me she recently assisted a group of jelly-legged midwives, raising money for their local hospital. (She told them to breathe, which must have felt ironic.) Some people are here simply because their loved ones are fond of edgy presents. \u201cThis is my dad\u2019s idea of a joke for my 30th birthday,\u201d admits Jordan, who is going before me. Is his dad here for the punchline? \u201cNah.\u201d Despite having two safety ropes, when you\u2019re told to lean backwards off a ledge at a height like this, your brain and (very) nervous system can\u2019t help but protest. I look down. It\u2019s dizzying. I\u2019m wearing a GoPro, rented for an additional fee, and trying not to swear. \u201cKeep your feet on the platform and lower yourself until your feet are above you,\u201d says Jack. I\u2019m a lobster clinging to the lip of a pot, upside down. I think about asking Jack what his surname is, or his favourite colour. Establish a connection. Oh, that\u2019s hostage negotiation. \u201cYou need to step off now,\u201d he shouts. Was it like this for Neil Armstrong, with Buzz Lightyear over the radio telling him to step off? Aldrin, not Lightyear. Haha! How do I stop this happening? I can\u2019t. I step off. As far as mankind goes, it\u2019s a tiny step. People do this all the time. But for one man, it\u2019s huge, a moment of absolute trust. I surrender to Jack and Sian, to the air, to life. They hold me. And my God, the view. London arrayed before me in all directions. The metal fungi of the city offices, bursting skyward. A halo of unbuilt space around St Paul\u2019s. The moss-like preponderance of treetops and greenery. I forget this city was built on rivers. But even more than the buildings, it\u2019s the tiny people I see. They flow like water too, over bridges and through streets, carrying their individual stories. I see the connected stream, the blood of a living city. I realise a torrent of them are heading towards me. To my left, London stadium is filling up, ahead of West Ham\u2019s game against Spurs. Fans swamp the boulevard. Jump by Van Halen blasts upward, hardly the soundtrack I want. I feed the rope through my hands, speeding my descent. Tom Petty, Free Fallin\u2019, would be more apt. A family inside the building gaze out at me, looking sick on my behalf. But I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s incredible how quickly one can adjust to this. It would actually be a good seat to watch the match, I think. As I get closer to Earth, the fans don\u2019t look like ants any more. They\u2019re gawking at me. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d one yells. There\u2019s no point replying. No one has any dignity when their feet aren\u2019t in contact with the ground. I feel like Boris Johnson on a zipwire.\nI remember gravity, and the harness, as my feet return to Earth. My testes hurt, I complain to Fran, in so many words, as I touch down. \u201cI\u2019ll just switch your GoPro off \u2026\u201d she says. Oh yeah. I\u2019ve picked up a fair amount of embarrassment during my sky journey. But what a terrifying privilege. I feel enlarged and free. I\u2019ve conquered fear, and even turned the air blue again. How\u2019s that for aerial dominance? Is this a gateway thrill? I do find myself wondering if I\u2019m allowed to use Stonehenge as a pommel horse, or high five the Angel of the North.

Sunil Kandar, Ghoramara Island, India I live in the Hatkhola locality of Ghoramara. I remember how on this island, during my childhood, I had a very happy and enjoyable life. We had a big mud-walled house. We also had large farmland of our own where rice and other vegetables grew. We sold a big part of our farm produce in the market. Like some other families in the island we were pretty rich. The farmland owned by our family was our biggest strength. Our island is located at the mouth of a river coming from the north. The northern edge of the island began sinking bit by bit under the river water when I was a child. Then, 20 or 25 years ago, the sea began eating away land around the southern edge of the island where we lived. Ghoramara began going underwater almost from all sides and the island began shrinking fast. Farmlands and houses of the people are constantly going underwater. Cyclones are pounding our island more frequently in recent years. The fragile island is too feeble to keep away the tidal waves. Often during natural disasters, tidal waves cause flooding of the island with salty seawater. Whatever farmlands are left on the island are turning unusable because of inundation by seawater and increasing salinity of the soil.\nOnce I owned four acres of farmland. In the past 20 years, three-quarters of it has been lost under the sea. This year I have been forced to buy rice for us, for the first time in my life. I am over 50 now. I cannot go out of the island, learn a new skill and pick up another job. My son knew he cannot earn a living on this island. So, he left the island and has become a migrant day-wage labourer in south India and sends money to support our family. Within a few years, my son, daughters and their families will have to move out of this island to save their lives. But my wife and I are already very old. Somehow we will spend the remaining few years of our lives on this island. Oceanographers and other experts came to the island and conducted studies five years ago. They said the water level around the island is rising and it will perhaps completely vanish underwater by 2050. But in the past five years, the island has been shrinking. I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/the-island-has-been-shrinking-living-on-the-frontline-of-global-heating", "last_update": "2021-10-29T09:06:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Optimism for Cop26: we must win the climate battle \u2013 and we absolutely can", "article": "I\u2019ve been covering climate and the environment for 17 years \u2013 it\u2019s astonishing to me that so many positive things are happening in response to the crisis. Of course, we should have been bringing down emissions much sooner, and lots of the things that should have happened didn\u2019t. In particular, I\u2019d point to energy efficiency, which we all thought would be a big win early on, and fossil fuel subsidies, which have not come down as fast as we would have hoped. But in general we are seeing positive trends. Coal, gas and other fossil fuels are mostly on the way out, and clean energy is rising and rising. Renewables are a key part of the solution to this crisis. We need to shift away from fossil fuel energy to clean forms of power, and we need to do so urgently. Thankfully, their use is growing massively around the world, and the cost of this renewable energy has come down far faster than anybody had anticipated: now, in most parts of the world, wind and solar power are as cheap as \u2013 or cheaper than \u2013 building coal-fired power plants, which is fantastic news.\nIt means the cost barrier to renewables that existed in the past has largely gone away, and we can see the cost of renewable energy, electric vehicle technology, and battery storage falling further. These will be hugely important at Cop26. I spoke to Alok Sharma, the president of the summit, earlier this week, and one thing he is very anxious about is that Cop addresses the real economy. The messages cannot just be political and high level about global action, but how this plays out on the ground with real people. It\u2019s vital that we don\u2019t see this as an abstract problem, but that it translates into greener business and personal decisions.\nIt really is essential that we hold businesses to account because they are holding the purse strings and they are the ones who make the world go round. We need to be vigilant against greenwashing, make sure we hold businesses to account on the targets, and ensure they are not wasting time with off-setting but making genuine reductions. The more businesses we have on board, the more successful the outcome is likely to be. What would success at Cop26 look like? For me, strong ambitions on emissions cuts, from all national governments, as well as at state and regional levels. Banks need to put their money where their mouths are too, in terms of green investments. There is hopefully going to be a deal on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and forests \u2013 we need to be planting more trees and restoring degraded land as a priority. The long-term goal of net zero by mid-century is key, and we need to see countries putting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in place, which are stringent 2030 goals. We may fall a bit short, but narrowing the gap would still be a positive outcome. After all, the world doesn\u2019t stop after Cop. But what we really do need is a plan. In my years reporting on this issue, I\u2019ve seen so many triumphs and disasters. The bottom line on our struggle against climate catastrophe is this: we don\u2019t have a choice but to win, and we absolutely can. There was a time when it seemed impossible to solve the problem of acid rain, but we did. It\u2019s true that greater challenges lie ahead, and they will require action from the whole global economy, but we have the technology and the ingenuity. I have no time for people who say this is too expensive \u2013 if we don\u2019t have a planet then we don\u2019t have an economy.

{"title": "Will I have to pay higher-rate stamp duty if I keep a rental flat?", "article": "Q I bought a flat in 2016 and lived there for a couple of years. I then got married in 2018 and moved in to my husband\u2019s house, which he\u2019d bought in 2015 and which remains solely in his name. I\u2019ve been renting out my flat ever since. We now plan to sell the house we live in and buy a new one. If I keep my rental flat will I be liable for higher rates of stamp duty? NA A No, I don\u2019t think that you will be liable for the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) and this is why. As luck would have it, I came across an illuminating example in HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) online Stamp Duty Land Tax Manual which describes your situation almost exactly (if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\u2019s the husband who has the rental property and they both live in the wife\u2019s house). Substituting you for Mr S (in the HMRC example) and your husband for Mrs S, this is how it reads: \u201cMr and Mrs A, a married couple, each own a residential property, with neither having any interest in the other\u2019s property. They both live in the property owned by Mr A; the property owned by Mrs A is rented out. Mr A is selling his property and they are jointly purchasing a new one, which will be their new main residence.

As they are married and have both lived in the property owned by Mr A as their main residence Mrs A will be treated as replacing their main residence. Mr A only owned one property at the end of the day of the transaction.\u201d If you hadn\u2019t lived in your husband\u2019s house as your main residence before he sold it, you would have to pay the higher rate of SDLT as would an unmarried couple in the same situation as you (which forms the basis of the next online HMRC example).", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/nov/01/will-i-have-to-pay-higher-rate-stamp-duty-if-i-keep-a-rental-flat", "last_update": "2021-10-31T16:03:19Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ex-Maldives president to tell Cop26: do not compromise on 1.5C", "article": "Five months after narrowly surviving a terrorist bomb attack, the former president of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed will arrive at the Cop26 summit with a defiant message: no compromise on 1.5C. That level of global heating is the most ambitious target on the table at Glasgow. It will require a global mobilisation of resources at a scale not seen outside wartime and at least a halving of fossil fuel emissions and tree burning by the end of this decade. Many oil exporting nations are reluctant to move this quickly, but Nasheed says small island states cannot accept anything less because they are already losing land and people to rising seas. \u201cI think 1.5C must be asked for again and restated and never left. Anything above 1.5C and the Maldives will not be there. We cannot sign a suicide pact,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nSmall island states such as the Maldives are often seen as the conscience of the Cop process because they are most at risk of climate chaos and push hardest for deep emissions cuts. But Nasheed said it would be a mistake for people in other parts of the world to think they were safer. \u201cThis is not a distant problem for little coloured people in the Indian Ocean, it is all of our problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing is framed as if it is just these tiny, sad islands losing land and people. But no, we are losing people everywhere. Usually you hear about flood deaths in Asia. Now we are getting the same news in Europe. If you don\u2019t listen to us, listen to your own people, who are dying in front of your eyes.\u201d Nasheed was almost killed in very different circumstances this year. A bomb attack on his home in May left him critically injured. He needed 16 hours of surgery and was then transferred to Germany for further treatment. No organisation has claimed responsibility, but police have arrested several Islamic State-linked religious extremists. \u201cI was on the brink of death. I feel there must be a reason why I survived,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the outcomes will hopefully be that I can work harder to advocate in favour of measures against climate change. I must try to work harder and impress the gravity of issue on everyone else.\u201d Now serving as the speaker of parliament, Nasheed said he had been shocked at the latest report from the Maldives environment committee, which said weather disaster alerts had increased more than fourfold over the past 20 years and more people were being swept out to sea due to storm surges and rough weather. In addition, coastlines are being eroded and more acidic water is destroying coral reef systems and the fisheries that depend on them.\nNasheed said one entire island had been lost in the Baa Atoll, which is a Unesco biosphere. \u201cWe are losing ground. We are losing people. We are losing our livelihood. We are losing our culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is happening now. It is upon us.\u201d Nasheed is among the most outspoken climate advocates on Earth. He has often suffered for his belief in democracy and opposition to destructive modes of development, which are all the more remarkable in a politically turbulent nation that has often been ruled by dictators. He has spent six years in jail where he was tortured and thrown into solitary confinement for months at a time. He has been similarly brave and outspoken on global heating. The veteran climate activist Bill McKibben has described him as one of only a handful of true world leaders in the fight to save the planet. Whenever he is not in jail, he said, he has attended Cop conferences. This has convinced him of the need for structural reform of the UN\u2019s climate change framework. \u201cWe cannot go on and on talking while the planet is burning or we will lose credibility as politicians and the UN will lose credibility as an institution. It should be able to deliver solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, because of the need for unanimity, we have a situation where if two countries agree on greater ambition but a third country says no, then the two countries reduce their targets to those of third country. We end up with the lowest common denominator.\u201d Top of his wishlist for Cop is for countries to align their climate plans with 1.5C. That is a long way off. Current commitments are putting the world on track for a calamitous 2.7C, according to the United Nations. Nasheed says he is frustrated by some leaders, such as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, who describe 1.5C as a very tall order because of the possible impact on jobs. \u201cListening to these people sometimes sounds like madness. For God\u2019s sake, if you want to protect jobs and a way of life, then you need climate action.\u201d He is frustrated by the world\u2019s biggest emitter, China. \u201cThey still think it is their right to poison the planet because Europeans have done it in the past. This is a mad idea, as if they are saying \u2018the west has brought us to the brink and now we have arrived to push everyone over the edge\u2019. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, especially now there is new technology as an alternative to fossil fuels.\u201d But he says a younger group of civil servants in China appear to hold more progressive views than the old guard. Nasheed hopes rich nations fulfil their promise of $100bn a year in climate finance starting from 2020, but said cash should not be a substitute for emissions-cutting action.\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t say we will give you more money if you accept 2C and we can keep rubbishing the planet. You can build a big wall and sit back and say isn\u2019t this a beautiful thing.\u201d He said it would be up to the UK, as the host government, to push for an ambitious agenda that supports the most vulnerable nations. \u201cSometimes the UK seems to think that just because they are the presidency they can\u2019t take a side. But no, they need to take our side to start the game. This should be about safety and survival. I think they should open the Cop by saying that.\u201d\n", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/ex-maldives-president-to-tell-cop26-do-not-compromise-on-15c", "last_update": "2021-10-31T19:02:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Optimism for Cop26: every bit of heating we prevent reduces suffering", "article": "The most important thing to say is that we can still beat the crisis \u2013 but we are against the clock. Emissions are piling up in the atmosphere every day that goes by, so we\u2019re in a race against time to act. This is a marathon, not a sprint. There is no moment in time when we go from a world that\u2019s fine to a world that\u2019s a disaster. But every action, by every person, matters. Every bit of heating you prevent reduces human and planetary suffering, because that\u2019s really what this will come down to. The good news is we have the tools, the knowledge and the technology \u2013 it\u2019s just a question of developing it quickly enough that we make it accessible and affordable to the mass market. For this, political will is key, and at Cop26 we need to see a strong expression of political will. What\u2019s important to note is that political will can be created, and one of the best ways to create it is via protest, in which people make their desire for change clear. What\u2019s also increasing political will, unfortunately, is that the impact of the crisis is becoming more obvious. Green solutions are often better than the thing they are replacing \u2013 they are frequently cleaner, quieter, and they will be cheaper when produced at scale. So they will win out. Anyone who has ever driven an electric carwill know how fantastic they are to drive. They are also cheaper to run, maintain, and within a few years they will be cheaper to buy in the first place. Most models can now do 200 miles without stopping, which is probably ample for most journeys.\nCellular meat is another good example of an exciting green solution \u2013 it\u2019s grown in vats in factories and is much more efficient because horns, tails etcetera don\u2019t need to be produced. People often recoil at the thought of lab-grown meat, but I wonder if they consider how meat is produced today. If it can be produced in a clean factory without the use of antibiotics, that\u2019s good for the customer too. I\u2019m in the fortunate position that I get to spend my working life informing people about what\u2019s going badly, what\u2019s going well, and what can be done. I\u2019ve spent much of my career focusing on this issue, and having a sense of agency is important for me. The other big thing that keeps the gloom away is meeting lots of bright, enthusiastic, hard-working people who are striving to tackle this problem. Equally, I feel very fortunate to work for an organisation like the Guardian that takes this issue very seriously \u2013 and has done for a very long time \u2013 and is dedicating plenty of space and resources to keeping it top of the news agenda.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2021/nov/01/optimism-for-cop26-every-bit-of-heating-we-prevent-reduces-suffering", "last_update": "2021-11-01T12:29:54Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Jet-lag, climate villains and coffee: the seven stages of every Cop | John Vidal", "article": "It\u2019s not the expectation that is unbearable with Cop26; it is the hope. The world, faced with the urgency of the climate crisis, demands that this is the summit to surpass all summits. Those of us who have experienced (or endured) them know that won\u2019t happen. There are seven stages to every Cop. This one is unlikely to be much different. 1 The arrival. Here we go again. Teams of jet-lagged lobbyists, diplomats, journos, bankers and business folk queue with delegations of indigenous peoples and youth groups, lawyers, NGOs and economists to enter the parallel universe that is a UN climate Cop. Within hours, the complaints will start about the price of coffee, the distance between meeting rooms, the Glaswegian accents, the rain, the trains, the traffic, the UN security, the heavy policing and the dearth of good restaurants. 2 The beauty contest. Prince Charles will welcome the world to Glasgow with three minutes of top-drawer blah blah to be followed by more blah blah by 100-plus leaders about the future of Earth, the plight of the poor, coral reefs, forests, and the need for compromise, radical ambition, vision and hope. Polite applause from some. 3 The great confusion. By day three, none of the 15,000 delegates or the public will have any idea what is happening, and those who say they do will be lying. The negotiations will take place behind closed doors and involve the obsessive drafting and redrafting of papers that either do reflect a country\u2019s position or are \u201cnon-papers\u201d, which don\u2019t but might. The talks have their own incomprehensible language, with Bingos and Mrvs, Namas and Napas, BAs and BRs, Redds and Lulucfs. No one outside the negotiating rooms is supposed to understand. 4 The squeeze. The game of diplomatic poker is on. The dice are loaded against poor countries and by day four the low-lying states and least developed countries will be complaining loudly and publicly that the US, UK, EU and others are not putting up the $100bn (\u00a375bn) a year that they pledged, and are shifting the goalposts of the Paris agreement by calling for all countries to adopt the same targets. The diplo-mud will fly. The sticking points will be over money, targets, scale of ambition, transfer of technology and timescales. The rich will be accused of being incompetent and negligent and will respond by saying, \u201cYah-boo, we\u2019re all in this together now.\u201d The conference chair, Alok Sharma, scurrying between groups of countries, will try to bridge the yawning divides that will have opened between the carbon haves and have-nots.\n5 The cavalry. At a certain point, usually near the end of week one, the many charities and the environment, development, climate and church groups, along with scientists, activists, indigenous peoples and celebrities, will stage demonstrations and stunts: gluing themselves to doors and floors, singing, invading press conferences and hanging off roofs. Most will be chucked out of the halls and banned from re-entry by UN guards. It is a bloodletting, and relieves the tensions. The climate villains will now be named \u2013 usually the US for its bullying tactics, the Saudis for their defence of fossil fuels, Brazil for cutting down the Amazon, Australia for its coal and the EU for not offering enough. Britain, now out of Europe, can be expected to be accused of doublespeak \u2013 pretending to side with the poor but actually working with the rich. 6 The trick. In week two, the negotiators hand over the proposals drawn up in week one to incoming ministers and their teams of political advisers. The horse-trading now begins. The powerful will have already twisted arms, offered aid, threatened sanctions and squeezed the pips out of the poor to make them fall in behind. But equally, China, India and others will use their diplomatic clout to counter-offer and raise the stakes. Ministers furiously brief their media friends. It\u2019s now a high-risk crapshoot. The tension will be unbearable as negotiations narrow down to a few paragraphs, then falter, stumble and inevitably nearly collapse. Rumours will fly that delegations are quitting, or that another draft has been agreed but rejected. Ministers will furiously brief their media friends. There will be a long and ghastly night as the corridors fill with exhausted delegates, the restaurants close, the coffee runs out and the long wait begins. 7 The sting. Cop should finish on the Friday night of week two, but \u2013 as with Cops in the past \u2013 this one is more likely to go to the wire on Saturday. A final text will be drawn up and a last plenary meeting will be called. An \u201cawkward\u201d, or \u201cprincipled\u201d, group of countries will now grandstand and call on the world for something better. In the end it may come down to Sharma calling the US, China and the EU, the world\u2019s great emitters, into a room for a final haggle at 6.30am. An agreement, weak or strong, will or will not be struck. Sharma will summon all the diplomatic muscle he can and then invite all countries to agree. The world will pray.

{"title": "Fancy a \u2018charbonnay\u2019? How France\u2019s coal belt reinvented itself as a tourist destination", "article": "A holiday at the Cit\u00e9 des \u00c9lectriciens in northern France may not sound like a glamorous getaway, but there are some genuine surprises to be discovered in the unspoiled region by the Belgian border, a short drive from Calais or Boulogne. The Louvre has established a satellite museum in Lens, while the lesser-known city of B\u00e9thune boasts fabulous art deco architecture, artisan breweries and exciting young chefs reinterpreting local recipes. The sandy beaches and dunes of the wild C\u00f4te d\u2019Opale are never far away, but what really takes my breath away is discovering a vineyard halfway up a former slag heap, all that is left of the region\u2019s coalmines. Fittingly, the vigneron has dubbed his crisp white wine not chardonnay but charbonnay \u2013 a pun on the French for coal, charbon.\nThe Cit\u00e9 des \u00c9lectriciens is actually all about miners rather than electricians. The village was purpose-built in the 1850s for local pit families \u2013 \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s novel Germinal would later expose the conditions that miners were forced to endure. It was one of several model townships across the French and Belgium coal belt, built by mining barons. Its name dates from the turn of the century, when the local post office asked for streets to be named, for easier delivery of mail \u2013 hence Rue Edison and Rue Marconi, among others. The Cit\u00e9 today resembles a miniature toy town, with neat rows of houses in red bricks rather than Lego. It was officially reopened in 2019 after a six-year, \u20ac15m restoration, but then the pandemic intervened and only now is it finally fully open to visitors. The 43 houses that were once home to mining families have been transformed into an imaginative base for discovering the surrounding countryside.\nA tiny cottage is a comfortable B&B (\u20ac60 a night), and a row of houses has been converted into four roomy self-catering g\u00eetes, with retro furniture and wallpaper. There\u2019s also space for artists working on community projects, who organise ateliers and talks for local schools. And, importantly, 10 houses are reserved for low-income families. Pride of place goes to two permanent exhibition halls. One is a modern, purpose-built space illustrating the long history of mining here up to its recognition as a Unesco world heritage site in 2012. The other recreates daily life in the Cit\u00e9, in five original homes through oral history recordings, photos and numerous reminders that behind this utopian experiment, the mine owners were operating what the French call \u201ccontrolled liberty\u201d. So while there were opportunities for education, sport, vegetable gardens and modern housing, the workers were also encouraged not to drink, and to start families, so as to provide the next generation of miners. The mineworks and shafts once dominated the adjoining town of Bruay-La-Buissi\u00e8re, though most have been demolished since their closure in 1979. But the surrounding countryside is still marked by volcano-like slag heaps, rising up to 150 metres, albeit now covered in thick vegetation. However, the terril outside the hamlet of Haillicourt looks strangely different from the rest, with neat lines of steep terraces just below the peak, which turn out to be one of the world\u2019s strangest vineyards.\n\u201cIt is now eight years since the first harvest on our historical terril,\u201d says Flavien Desette from Haillicourt\u2019s town hall, \u201cand our chardonnay, which we have christened \u2018charbonnay\u2019, is getting respected reviews and featuring on the wine lists of restaurants around France, so now numerous other winemakers are looking at planting vineyards around here.\u201d So far, production is limited to about 3,000 bottles, and tours of the vineyard and the tiny vaulted cellar beneath Haillicourt\u2019s 18th-century priory can be organised through the town hall. Visit during the harvest and you will see 50 villagers picking grapes by hand, then hand pressing them. At certain times of year, the terril literally starts steaming, thanks to the combustible but fertile mix of schist and soil. It\u2019s a quite unique terroir.\nThe Cit\u00e9 des \u00c9lectriciens lies between two very contrasting, historic northern French cities, Lens and B\u00e9thune. Both are near the great battlefields of the first world war, and had been largely razed to the ground by the time peace was signed. B\u00e9thune was beautifully rebuilt in art deco style, especially the opulent town square whose medieval belfry miraculously survived, and is now part of the Unesco world heritage site. The Grand Place is the life and soul of the city, lined with bistros, brasseries and traditional estaminet bars. And just off the main square, a magnificent mansion is being brought back to life by a creative young chef, Maxime Leplat and his wife, No\u00e9mie. The sumptuous ground floor with soaring ceiling and crystal chandeliers is split into a casual bistronomie-style dining room \u2013 offering a three-course set lunch for \u20ac29 \u2013 and a fine dining section where Maxime is determined to earn his first Michelin star. Adventurous foodies signing up for the tasting experience are led straight to the kitchen and a marble table opposite the imposing bearded figure of Maxime. While his enthusiastic assistants rush around prepping dishes, the chef conjures up half a dozen unexpected appetisers, often paired with local craft beers, that include a delicate macaron of tomato and shrimps, a molecular take on the traditional mackerel in mustard sauce, a beef carbonnade in a marshmallow and a mini croque-monsieur with pungent local Maroilles cheese topped with pickled herring. The biggest surprise, though, is the bill at \u20ac48 a head. During the long lockdown, No\u00e9mie and Maxime renovated four rooms above the restaurant into fashionable B&B accommodation (doubles \u20ac95).\nLens did not fare so well during its postwar reconstruction and is in a messy mix of styles that for a long time left the city best known for its fanatical football club. That all changed when an agreement was made with the Louvre to build its first satellite museum in France here, which opened in 2012. While the futuristic architecture of Louvre-Lens is breathtaking, what really surprises the visitor is the contrast, as a viewing experience, with the Paris musesum. The immense permanent collection, of which 20% rotates each year, is in a revolutionary single open area. I have certainly never seen a museum space like this: in one room you pass from paintings and sculptures dating from 3500BC to ones created in 1850. Beno\u00eet Di\u00e9val of the local tourism office says: \u201cThe museum has really changed Lens profoundly. Not just opening a new world of art for the population, but having an enormous impact on the local economy. That has meant not just jobs in the museum, hotels and restaurant, but stimulating a whole series of startup community projects in design, textiles and artisan ales.\u201d The museum celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2022, so a visit this autumn could mean avoiding the inevitable big queues next year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/nov/01/cite-des-electriciens-charbonnay-coal-france-tourist-destination", "last_update": "2021-11-01T09:47:23Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Poor countries at Cop26 concerned by G20\u2019s limited climate progress", "article": "The G20 is failing poor and vulnerable countries by not agreeing to a climate plan that would ensure their people\u2019s survival, leading figures at the Cop26 climate talks have said. Leaders representing more than a billion of the people most at risk from the climate crisis told the Guardian they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d and had hoped for more from the G20 summit in Rome. They said the prospect of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a vital threshold that scientists say is a \u201cplanetary boundary\u201d, was slipping away as the UN conference opened in Glasgow.\nGaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which represents 39 countries, said: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen it appears we are going to overshoot 1.5C. We are very concerned about that. This is a matter of survival for us.\u201d He blamed the influence of powerful private-sector interests for the G20\u2019s failure to come up with better plans, and said developed countries would also suffer the consequences of climate breakdown. \u201cWe are here to save the planet, not to protect profits. There are very powerful multinational firms and lobbies \u2026 who benefit from fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d The G20 produced what some analysts said was significant progress in Rome, with a pledge to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of century and take action this decade to limit global heating to 1.5C, but poor countries said the promises were not accompanied by clear plans. They urged the G20 leaders arriving in Glasgow for two days of talks with more than 100 other heads of state, which will be followed by nearly two weeks of talks among senior officials, to come up with more ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cI\u2019m extremely worried, but despite the disappointment I\u2019m still hopeful,\u201d said Browne. Sonam Wangdi, the chair of the Least Developed Countries group, which represents more than a billion people globally, said: \u201cThe progress is definitely not enough up to now. We are a long way from a 1.5C pathway. We need them to ramp up ambition. We have done our share, and we contributed least to the problem.\u201d At more than 1.5C of heating, many small islands face inundation from rising sea levels and fiercer storm surges, but Browne said developed countries were also at risk. \u201cMany of them have coastal areas too,\u201d he pointed out. Steve Victor, the environment minister of Palau, said: \u201cThe G20 has lagged far behind where it must be to secure a safe future for the people of small island developing states. This is not an abstract concept or political issue for us. The threat of climate change, to us, can\u2019t be overstated. We are now living it. The G20 makes up 80% of global emissions, they are the ones most critical for ensuring we can stay on a path to a 1.5C future.\u201d He said the G20 should agree to phase out coal, which it has failed to do, though it did agree to stop financing new coal development overseas. It should also halt fossil fuel subsidies, he added. Bruce Billimon, the health minister of the Marshall Islands, said: \u201cWe live in a time in which the decisions we make will have impactful consequences in the future and coming generations, on our people\u2019s health, wellbeing, safety and of course security. \u201cAlready, at 1.1C, my country can feel the climate change effects, and beyond 1.5C, unquestionably, the people of the Marshall Islands and other vulnerable nations will be in peril. And the impacts will not only be felt in states like mine, but also, I believe it will be a ripple effect, thus in years to come all of the countries of the G20 as well.\u201d The UK said developing countries would have the opportunity on Monday to put these concerns to G20 leaders at a face-to-face meeting in Glasgow. Officials from within the G20 felt that substantial progress had been made in Rome. \u201cThere has been a shift in the zeitgeist, recognising the need to look at the science and that we need to accelerate action in this crucial decade,\u201d said one, adding that more progress could be expected at Cop26 on countries making moves away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. The G20 \u2013 which includes major fossil fuel producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia that have long been hostile to climate action as well as the world\u2019s biggest emitter, China \u2013 agreed to take action this decade on emissions, though they stopped short of pledging the 45% emissions cuts that scientists say are needed by 2030 to stick to the 1.5C limit. Browne, however, said rich countries should aim to reach net zero by 2040 and developing countries by 2050. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, gave a positive assessment: \u201cThis is a shift from what they have previously said. The crucial words are on this decade. Previously they had only talked about 2050, which is too far away. \u201cThis is an expression of a growing sense of urgency in the G20, driven by both events and science. This is a political signal that will add momentum to the cop and help in reaching agreement at cop. We were not expecting this language.\u201d Victor, however, said more was needed. \u201cThe message is simple. Show us your higher ambition. This decade is, perhaps, the decisive decade in history. If we fail to halve emissions by 2030, our chance to stay within the 1.5C limit will be lost, and with it the safe and secure future that the people of vulnerable countries deserve.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/poor-countries-at-cop26-concerned-by-g20s-limited-climate-progress", "last_update": "2021-11-01T08:28:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Liberal senator Gerard Rennick to withhold vote in protest against Covid vaccine mandates", "article": "Queensland senator Gerard Rennick will withhold his vote from the Coalition until the government stops supporting vaccine mandates and provides immediate assistance to people who have suffered adverse affects from Covid-19 vaccines. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the protective benefits of Covid vaccines \u201cfar outweigh the potential risks of vaccination\u201d, and serious side effects are \u201cvery rare\u201d. Rennick has been highlighting cases of adverse effects over the past fortnight and he wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Sunday advising he would withhold his vote in the Senate over the issue. The Liberal senator is calling for the government to scrap vaccine mandates and indemnities for the states, and improve the compensation scheme for adverse events. He also says children should be excluded from any mandates and that the \u201ctyranny\u201d of domestic travel restrictions should end.\n\u201cNo person in this country should be forced to lose their job because they don\u2019t want to take a Covid vaccine,\u201d Rennick says in the letter. He says a \u201cfit and proper\u201d compensation scheme for victims of adverse effects is needed, calling for the scrapping of the $5,000 cost threshold and for payments to begin immediately. \u201cMany victims have been unable to work and are facing economic as well as health issues as a result of an adverse event from the vaccine,\u201d he claims. \u201cVictims should not have to wait until next year to receive compensation and income support.\u201d He also suggests that people who have had an adverse event for a first dose have been unable to refuse a second dose, calling the scenario \u201ccompletely inhumane\u201d. In the letter, Rennick says the federal government is indirectly supporting vaccine mandates imposed by states and private employers by providing the indemnity scheme. \u201cIf as you say that the commonwealth doesn\u2019t support mandatory vaccinations, then why are we paying for and indemnifying vaccines being mandated by the state?\u201d Rennick has previously urged the government to support a fresh high court challenge against border closures, and told the Coalition party room last month he was considering withdrawing his vote.\nParliament is scheduled to sit for one more fortnight this year, with several pieces of legislation still on the Coalition\u2019s agenda for this term of government. This includes a bill to establish a federal integrity commission, a promised religious discrimination act, new cyber security laws, and controversial voter ID laws. The Coalition holds 36 of 76 Senate positions and needs three members of the Senate crossbench to pass legislation. If the government loses the support of Rennick in the Senate, it will need four of the five crossbench votes to pass legislation against opposition from Labor and the Greens.

{"title": "Judge Judy: the $440m reality star\u2019s new show is \u2026 the same as her last one", "article": "One of the enduring mysteries of the last few decades is how Judy Sheindlin became the highest-paid woman on American television. Towards the end of Judge Judy\u2019s 25-year run, Sheindlin was hauling in $47m a year (her estimated net worth is about $440m). Since the show only required her to work for 52 days a year, that meant she earned $900,000 just by showing up. And this was Judge Judy, for crying out loud. It was a televised small-claims court. It was, by its very nature, mundane and repetitious.\nAnd now it is over. Earlier this year, Sheindlin made the decision to hang up her gavel. You might not have noticed, since Judge Judy has been airing in reruns since then, and every episode is absolutely identical to every other episode. But while you or I might take this downtime as an opportunity to kick back and enjoy our mountains of unimaginable wealth, Sheindlin has not. For she already has a new show on IMDb TV. It\u2019s called Judy Justice. And if you liked Judge Judy then, oh boy, are your rock-bottom expectations about to be expertly filled. Judy Justice \u2013 very much the Hollywood Hogan of minor arbitration shows \u2013 has been described as a \u201cflashier\u201d version of Judge Judy, although only the top percentile of Judge Judy acolytes would be able to spot any difference. Sheindlin isn\u2019t wearing the lace collar of old, and her robe is now burgundy instead of black, but this is by no means a reinvented wheel. The format of the new show remains exactly the same as the old one: a procession of dirtbags line up to publicly air their petty disputes, and Sheindlin interrogates them before making a decision.\nThe show is so identical to Judge Judy, in fact, that the first episode falls into line without any real explanation. We see a courtroom. We see two bozos who got drunk and had a fight. And then we see Sheindlin pull a vaguely unamused face. A narrator announces \u201cThis is Judy Justice\u201d and then we\u2019re off to the races. And since IMDb TV (and, honestly, who knew that was a thing?) is ad-supported, we even still get the old pre-commercial \u201ccoming up\u201d buffers to gee up our flagging interest. At first glance, it\u2019s hard to know who \u2013 other than Sheindlin\u2019s accountants \u2013 Judy Justice is for. Indeed, it has been reported that her main competition here is herself; CBS is aggressively broadcasting a series of reruns (which have traditionally always got high ratings) during the first volley of Judy Justice episodes, in the hope that casual viewers would prefer to watch easily accessible old episodes rather than seek out a new and hellishly obscure streaming service. And if your viewing tendencies already default to streaming, then why would you watch Judy Justice at all? You have every amazing television programme ever made at your disposal. Why, given the depth and breadth of the major streaming services, would anyone choose to watch a daily half-hour lowbrow courtroom show? Even once you\u2019ve taken Sheindlin\u2019s extraordinary salary demands into account, this is still a filler show that has to find a home in a media landscape that no longer requires filler. Having said that, of course, I have to confess to enjoying Judy Justice a little. It\u2019s an aggressive throwback to the bad old days when television was full of exploitative little shows where grubby fools would line up to broadcast their idiocy on television, knowing full well that they were likely to come out of it looking terrible. And, remember, this exists at the classier end of the spectrum. Yes, the first episode is about a couple who fought so much that they lost their children. And, yes, the second episode is about a woman who attacked another woman with a bottle. And, yes, an upcoming episode is entitled Backyard Fist Fight. But Sheindlin remains a watchable presence; still sharp, still wry, still outwardly hating every second of her time onscreen. She\u2019s a compelling character, even after all these years, and that\u2019s what will draw people back to the show. Surely nobody on the face of the Earth is going to watch every new episode of Judy Justice on a daily basis. But to dip in and out of now and again, it\u2019s going to be just fine. This is enough, though. If the Roku Channel happens to be planning a reboot of The Jerry Springer Show any time soon, it might be time to rethink things.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/01/judge-judy-new-show-streaming", "last_update": "2021-10-29T20:37:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Monday briefing: \u2018One minute to midnight\u2019", "article": "Top story: G20 leaves stiff task for Glasgow Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Boris Johnson will warn today that the world is at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d in terms of keeping warming below 1.5C as he prepares to host the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. With the UN predicting a catastrophic rise of 2.7C on the current trajectory, almost 200 national representatives, including US president Joe Biden and India\u2019s Narendra Modi, will gather in Scotland. But the summit is at serious risk of failure because countries are still not promising enough to restrict global temperature rises to below 1.5C, the prime minister has warned. Little was achieved in two days of preliminary talks at the G20 meeting in Rome, Johnson conceded, leaving the chances of success in Glasgow as \u201csix out of 10\u201d. Only 12 of the G20 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions by or around 2050. Several key nations \u2013 China and Saudi Arabia \u2013 are only formally pledging to meet that goal by 2060. The commitments being made so far were a \u201cdrop in the rapidly warming ocean\u201d, Johnson added. The UK\u2019s only Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, says the summit is \u201cour last best chance\u201d to tackle the climate emergency, but warns that Johnson is \u201cuniquely ill-equipped to deal with a crisis like climate change, where you need public trust\u201d. Aberdeen has long been the centre of Britain\u2019s fossil fuel industry so our economics editor Larry Elliott has been speaking to business and civic leaders in the Scottish city to see how it can transition to a net zero model. * * * The great resignation \u2013 Almost a quarter of workers are actively planning to change employers in the next few months, a report has claimed, as part of a \u201cgreat resignation\u201d prompted by a high number of vacancies and burnout caused by the pandemic. A survey of 6,000 workers by a recruitment firm found that 69% of them were feeling confident about moving to a new role in the next few months, with 24% planning a change within three to six months. Victoria Short, chief executive at Randstad UK, said: \u201cThe pandemic has made people step back and rethink their lives. Covid has reminded them that life is too short.\u201d * * * Train collision \u2013 A train driver and a number of passengers are recovering in hospital this morning after two trains collided in Salisbury last night. Emergency services declared a critical incident when a carriage on the 17.08 Portsmouth Harbour to Bristol Temple Meads service was derailed after hitting an object. The 17.20 London Waterloo to Honiton service then crashed into it when signalling was damaged. The line will be closed on Monday affecting SWR trains between Exeter and Basingstoke, and GWR trains between Westbury and Portsmouth. * * * Youth gap \u2013 Children in affluent areas of England are twice as likely to have access to youth clubs and other out-of-school activities as those in poorer locations, the first nationwide survey of youth services in more than a decade has revealed. The National Youth Agency looked at 8,500 organisations including the Scouts and Guides, Boys\u2019 Brigade, Woodcraft Folk and YMCA. The survey also found youth buildings are more than twice as likely to be purpose-built for or aimed towards young people in affluent areas than in deprived areas. * * * \u2018I\u2019ve got to hold her\u2019 \u2013 Covid booster shots will be available for people who had their second shot more than six months ago at walk-in clinics in England from today. There were hugs and tears at Sydney airport overnight as families were reunited after the ban on mandatory quarantine following international flights was lifted in Australia. The nation\u2019s strict Covid rules were relaxed to allow fully vaccinated Australians to walk freely out of the airport for the first time in 583 days. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to my daughter, I\u2019ve got to hold her,\u201d one woman said as she waited at the terminal. Many, like Ethan Cater, were returning home to visit sick relatives. \u201cI\u2019m really scared and emotional because I really want to see my mum,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe doctor said that she hasn\u2019t got long.\u201d Thailand has also dropped some restrictions which means fully jabbed tourists can visit the country again from today. Tonga has gone into lockdown and is rushing to vaccinate its population after recording its first ever case of Covid. * * *\n\u2018End of sexism in sport\u2019 \u2013 The International Handball Federation has responded to widespread accusations of sexism by changing its rules around women\u2019s uniforms to allow bike shorts and tank tops instead of bikini bottoms and crop tops. The governing body has been under pressure since the Norwegian women\u2019s beach handball team was fined \u20ac1,500 for wearing \u201cimproper\u201d shorts.

The Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, described the chance to lead his team out in the FA Cup final at Wembley as \u201csurreal\u201d after Beth Mead helped the Gunners sweep aside Brighton with a dominant 3-0 win.

{"title": "Slow transfer to Australian hospital contributed to death of Iranian refugee on Nauru, coroner finds", "article": "Omid Masoumali \u2013 the Iranian refugee who set himself on fire on Nauru in protest at his indefinite detention \u2013 would almost certainly have survived if he had been better cared for, or transferred more quickly to an Australian hospital, a coroner has found. It took nearly 30 hours to bring Masoumali, suffering burns to 57% of his body, to Australia, after he doused himself in petrol and self-immolated in protest at his indefinite detention, telling those watching: \u201cI cannot take it any more.\u201d Ineffectively treated and monitored at Nauru\u2019s hospital, which lacked the equipment or specialist doctors to care for him, he suffered a heart attack before leaving the island and could not be revived.\nHis coronial inquest heard from a burns specialist there was a 95% chance he would have survived had he been promptly and effectively treated, and had access to a tertiary hospital. Queensland coroner Terry Ryan said Masoumali\u2019s initial injuries were not life-threatening if properly treated. \u201cIf Omid received appropriate monitoring and ventilation before he was transferred [to Brisbane] \u2026 his chances of survival, while not assured, would have been greatly increased.\u201d Masoumali\u2019s mother, Elham Arouni Hesari, said her son \u201cloved Australia, but the way Australia rejected him and took his life will forever torture me\u201d. \u201cMy son had serious burns and then internal bleeding. Why did they operate on him in a place that did not have adequate medical facilities to deal with his burns?\u201d In 2014, the Australian government was told in a report there were \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in Nauru hospital\u2019s ability to care for critically ill patients, with no blood bank, or working ventilator, or staff trained to use it. In February 2016, two months before Masoumali\u2019s death, the Australian Border Force\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr John Brayley, alongside other doctors, inspected Nauru\u2019s hospital. A report from the visit stated there was no intensive care unit, and the high-dependence unit was \u201cill-equipped\u201d. The Queensland coroner said that beyond the substandard medical facilities and treatment, the indefinite nature of detention within Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime was damaging to refugees\u2019 mental health. Masoumali had been held on Nauru for more than 950 days at the time of his death. \u201cI consider that his actions were those of someone who had given up hope and felt powerless as a result of his prolonged placement on Nauru.\u201d Arguing indefinite detention was inherently harmful, the coroner urged the government to provide certainty to those it detained, and more rapidly find settlement solutions for them. \u201cI consider that there is a need to provide more certainty to refugees to ensure those who are successful in their asylum applications are resettled in third countries expeditiously and that refugees are given some assurance that will be achieved.\u201d Omid Masoumali arrived in Australia by boat in September 2013, and was sent to Nauru 10 days later. His claim for protection was formally recognised in 2014: he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran and Australia was legally obliged to protect him. His death was one of the most traumatic episodes during a period of catastrophic mental health for many of those held on Nauru. Acts of self-harm and suicide attempts were common, and children began to exhibit signs of the rarely seen \u201cresignation syndrome\u201d. Video of Masoumali\u2019s self-immolation shows him standing in a clearing, soaked in liquid, and shouting to the people around him. \u201cThis is how tired we are,\u201d Masoumali reportedly shouted. \u201cThis action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more.\u201d In the footage Omid then uses a lighter to set himself on fire. Onlookers scream, tackling him to the ground, smothering the flames with sheets and removing his burning and melted clothing. He is conscious. Later vision shows Masoumali at the hospital pacing up and down screaming with severe burns apparent to his arms, legs, chest and back. Distressed friends can be seen and heard pleading for him to be given assistance. His fiancee, who can not be named for legal reasons, was held on Nauru with Masoumali. Now living in Australia, she launched legal action against the Australian government for negligence. She told the Guardian in 2017: \u201cI will forever miss Omid. \u201cI will miss how he made me feel safe and looking forward to a better future. I wish I could feel that way again.\u201d The coronial inquest into Masoumali\u2019s death heard from Dr Jason Miller, a Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital burns specialist, who testified that, based on Masoumali\u2019s age and the extent of his burns, his injuries would have a death rate of 5%-10% under his care. \u201cAt the stage of all my discussions, he was stable,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo, certainly it appeared the burn was very survivable at that point. But Miller said that surviving severe burns was \u201cfully dependent on the care that he received in a timely fashion\u201d. \u201cThe only chance he had was to have more effective care in an earlier timeframe. Unfortunately, that couldn\u2019t be provided.\u201d Miller said conditions at the Nauru hospital were \u201cwholly unacceptable from a clinical point of view\u201d. George Newhouse, principal solicitor with the National Justice Project said Masoumali\u2019s death was evidence of the systemic failures of Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime which, he said, left asylum seekers and refugees languishing for years in indefinite detention. \u201cThe current system is a failure and is intensifying the cruelty, pain and anguish being suffered by men, women and children left on Nauru and in PNG and all those who remain in limbo in Australia.\u201d Graham Thom, refugee adviser for Amnesty International, said Masoumali\u2019s death was \u201ctotally avoidable\u201d, but was the result of years of neglect by the Australian government and an \u201cappalling medical response\u201d. Human rights advocate, and former Socceroo, Craig Foster, said Masoumali\u2019s death \u201cencapsulates the appalling harm that successive Australian governments have inflicted on thousands of refugees over the past eight and a half years\u201d. A spokesperson for the department of home affairs said the department was considering the coroner\u2019s findings and recommendations closely. \u201cThe Australian government works closely with the government of Nauru to ensure transferees have access to health and mental health services,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe government of Nauru is responsible for the healthcare of individuals residing in Nauru under regional processing arrangements.\u201d Australia has provided $54.9m in medical services upgrades to Nauru, including a surgical facility at Nauru hospital. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

The \u00a31.5bn scheme was designed to improve 600,000 properties but, according to data uncovered by the Liberal Democrats, only a small number of homes benefited from funding for much-needed improvements.\nIn total 41,300 measures were installed, according to the figures, with low-income households benefiting from around half of the jobs. Launched in a blaze of publicity last year, the scheme offered homeowners in England vouchers worth up to \u00a310,000 to make their homes more energy efficient or to replace old boilers. While those in work were offered a maximum of \u00a35,000 a household to cover two-thirds of the work, those on low incomes and certain benefits could claim the entire cost, up to \u00a310,000. However, almost immediately the scheme ran into difficulties with claimants saying it was impossible to find accredited installers who were either willing or able to do the work. The scheme was scrapped in March, and in the same month a select committee of MPs said it had been \u201cbotched [in] implementation\u201d and that the administration had been \u201cnothing short of disastrous\u201d. According to the figures seen by the Lib Dems, 15,182 home insulation measures have been installed for low-income households, including 2,063 loft insulations, 4,752 pitched roof insulations and 5,153 external solid wall insulations. Low-income households also installed 2,359 heat pumps and 5,257 solar thermal panels. In total 41,300 measures were installed, according to the data.\nWhile applications made before March are still being processed, the Lib Dems said the scheme\u2019s withdrawal has left home owners no meaningful government support for insulation. The government\u2019s recent announcement on green homes included a proposal that mortgage lenders be set targets to improve the average energy performance rating of the properties that they lend on. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for climate emergency and energy, said: \u201cWe know home insulation is the easiest way to cut energy bills. But this scheme was a complete disaster, and now the government appears to be passing the buck on to mortgage lenders and homeowners. Serious questions need to be asked about how such an important programme for the environment and household bills was allowed to fail like this.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/green-homes-grant-scheme-helped-just-15000-low-income-households", "last_update": "2021-10-31T22:36:11Z", "source": "Guardian"},

It\u2019s an experience being shared by state and local officials across the United States. For decades, those officials have largely been invisible, working out of the public spotlight to ensure the machinery of elections runs smoothly. But as Trump and allies target that machinery as part of an effort to insist something was amiss in 2020, those officials have been thrust into the national spotlight and subject to vicious harassment. Nearly one in three election officials feel unsafe in their job, according to an April survey commissioned by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a barrage every day,\u201d Katie Hobbs, Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, told the Guardian. She said the threats have bombarded virtually every part of her office, including services that have nothing to do with elections. Hobbs, a Democrat who is running for governor, testified last week at a Senate hearing on the threats, telling lawmakers her family had also been threatened, with calls coming in to her husband\u2019s employer to fire him. Al Schmidt, a Republican election official in Philadelphia, told senators the threats were \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d as he read messages calling for the murder of him and his family.

He said he\u2019s never experienced the kinds of attacks that he\u2019s seen over the past year. \u201cI\u2019ve done election observations overseas and you see how in those emerging democracies, former Soviet countries, how people are afraid to vote certain ways and so they all vote for the person. You can see now that possibility on the horizon at some point,\u201d he said. Barron and other election officials said that partisan websites as well as elected officials who continue to spread misleading and false information were facilitating the harassment. Barron described a spike in threats against him between Christmas and New Year\u2019s last year after Trump played a video of Barron to supporters at a Georgia rally. They also said they\u2019re deeply concerned that so many election officials are choosing to leave the profession, creating openings for people with little experience or nefarious motives to get into positions where they could exercise enormous power over how elections are run. \u201cThere are a lot of people leaving the profession. So I think you\u2019re gonna end up with more inexperienced people running these offices. You\u2019re going to see people in these types of jobs for a shorter period of time because the stress, after a while, it\u2019s hard to ignore it all the time,\u201d Barron said. \u201cI think part of the purpose of these threats and this ongoing lie is to get people to quit their jobs,\u201d said Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of the Milwaukee election commission, who has also received a wave of threats since the election. \u201cSo that then you have either elections that aren\u2019t as well run and you get people in who you can control.\u201d In Milwaukee, another place where Trump has falsely claimed fraud, Woodall-Vogg linked threats she has received to misleading stories published in the Gateway Pundit, a far-right news site that frequently published false information about elections.\nLast year, she began getting some angry calls after the site ran a story inaccurately saying she \u201clost\u201d a USB drive on election night. She started receiving death threats this summer after the site published an email from election night in which she jokingly responded to an elections consultant about the timing of when Milwaukee released its election results. \u201cI should have not responded,\u201d she said. Threats began pouring in over email, saying things like Woodall-Vogg deserved to go before a firing squad and calling her \u201ctreasonous\u201d. She received a letter at home and threats to her personal Gmail account. Woodall-Vogg wasn\u2019t persuaded the callers would actually act on the threat, but went out of state for 10 days last summer as a precaution. She also got an alarm system and a Ring doorbell for extra security at home. At work, the office layout is being reconfigured to adjust the point at which someone coming in first interacts with a staff member. Workers are also installing security glass that is harder to break, Woodall-Vogg said. \u201cI always liked that my job was non-partisan. I really don\u2019t like politics,\u201d said Woodall-Vogg. \u201cI feel like in the past year, the threats are a direct result of the same political rhetoric that\u2019s made my job as partisan and as contentious as it is. It\u2019s all resulting from this facade of election fraud, that the election was rigged.\u201d As election officials face threats across the country, Republican lawmakers have inserted provisions into several new laws that impose steep penalties for officials who run afoul of election rules. In Iowa, a new Republican-backed law authorizes a fine of up to $10,000 on officials who commit \u201ctechnical infraction\u201d. A new Texas law similarly authorizes criminal punishment and $1,000 fines on election officials who fail to follow rules. Law enforcement across the country has struggled to respond to the threats against election officials, a Reuters investigation from September found. The investigation identified 102 threats of violence or death against election officials in key battleground states, but could only document four instances in which someone had been charged, though it\u2019s possible there may have been more arrests. The justice department launched a taskforce to address threats against election workers in July. In August, the official in charge of the taskforce told secretaries of state that \u201cthe response has been inadequate,\u201d according to Reuters. Federal officials lacked the infrastructure to constantly monitor threats against election officials nationwide and relied on those who were aware of them to report them. \u201cA lot of these law enforcement agencies are relying on us to report. And it\u2019s hard for us to know what we should be reporting, because we\u2019re not trained in threat assessment and it\u2019s hard for us to know and to have the time to sort through,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility that we\u2019re missing something.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/us-election-workers-threats-violence", "last_update": "2021-10-29T21:06:20Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "To avert climate disaster, we need resilient societies built on love, not just technology | Gaia Vince ", "article": "When things look especially bleak for humankind, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves who we are \u2013 what makes us such a special species. Beyond our machines and our buildings, beyond our fiery conquests, beyond all of it, we\u2019re exceptional creatures because we are capable of love. And not just one to one and within our families, but on a massive scale. This is especially pertinent as we face the climate crisis. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of our technological transition, which dominates the climate adaptation narrative. We are the technological ape, and our technologies will be vital in solving this crisis: windmills to decarbonise our energy systems, flood defences against rising seas, and air conditioners to survive brutal heatwaves. We will need many more technological fixes, and much faster. Just as essential to our survival, however, are social fixes. Love is often seen as a charming but irrelevant characteristic in our species\u2019 story \u2013 an evolutionary quirk, relegated to a footnote for poets and playwrights to ponder. But love is what draws us together to forge the strong, caring societies that make us so successful as a species. And it is what will, ultimately, save us from this crisis. For citizens of rich countries, the climate crisis is primarily a social crisis \u2013 and we have not begun the social adaptation required. Indeed, we\u2019re not even discussing the extent of the problem. We face a catastrophic failure of our social systems to protect the most vulnerable people from the devastating impacts. The biggest issue will be poverty, and the solution is not technological but social. Take food. Climate change will hit crops around the world \u2013 heatwaves, droughts and extreme storms will cause harvests to be lost regularly, potentially slashing crop production by a third by 2050. We\u2019re already experiencing problems. Canada\u2019s pea production is down by about half, and wheat harvests reduced by more than a third compared with last year\u2019s, for instance, because of extreme weather. This means food prices will go up around the globe. Wheat failures will make a range of products more expensive in UK shops \u2013 pasta prices are expected to rise by about 50% in the next month. Rice and other cereals, fruit, vegetables, oils, cotton and coffee will all be similarly affected over the coming decade. Heat and drought also make crops less nutritious, so families will struggle to afford their weekly shop and get less benefit from what they do buy. The climate crisis demands resilient food systems. Logistically, this means large-scale storage and adapting to new food sources, including insect proteins and algae. Just as importantly, it means strengthening social systems so that everyone has access to nutritional foods, whatever their circumstances. We can\u2019t lurch from crisis to crisis hoping the charitable sector will provide. When food prices rise \u2013 as they will \u2013 food banks will receive fewer donations at a time when demand is greatest. Food poverty is already shockingly prevalent, and disproportionately affects people with disabilities and minority groups. The past year in Britain has seen a vast rise in the use of food banks. Unless we manage deep societal adaptation to climate breakdown, the coming crisis will make hunger worse. That takes planning for adequate welfare systems for a hotter world with less reliable agriculture. There is no shame in being poor or hungry; the shame lies with a government that allows people to struggle with basic needs while others accumulate obscene wealth. Inequality is a killer. We\u2019ve seen this through the Covid pandemic; we will see it to an even greater extent as the climate crisis deepens. Climate change is a threat-multiplier. Londoners may not die directly from storm surges that wash away their homes, or stronger cyclones, as people in equatorial regions will. But they may well die from a social system that cannot adapt to accommodate regular flood damage, higher food prices and incapacitating heatwaves, and people are already weakened by poor healthcare and underfunded services. Today, a lack of regulation means we\u2019re continuing to build poor housing stock without adequate insulation and buildings unable to generate their own energy through heat pumps or solar installations, which are highly vulnerable to extreme weather. This means that the poorest families risk being stuck in uninsurable, unsaleable houses. As flood-prone areas depopulate and businesses move away, the poorest people will be left behind \u2013 needing to travel further for schools, for work and for every other amenity. Safer places outside flooding zones will experience climate gentrification, in which richer people move in and push up the property prices, or pay huge sums to shore up their properties. When people in the hardest-hit tropical regions of the world are forced to flee their climate crisis \u2013 and not in their hundreds but in their hundreds of thousands \u2013 that will become our climate crisis too. We need to plan today for the influx of large numbers of traumatised people, with preparations for adequate housing and healthcare, so they do not overwhelm our ability to take them in. Managed well, climate migration could help revive depopulated towns and boost our economies. Done poorly, it could end up swelling the population of desperate and homeless people on our streets. A resilient society is one in which people have their basic needs met, including universal access to healthcare, shelter and nutrition, so they can cope with the climate challenges we know are coming. We must create societies that are confident and flourishing so they are not threatened by disaster and migration, but are resilient and welcoming. That means ensuring people don\u2019t feel disenfranchised, but included.\nLove is itself an evolved human survival adaptation. We see evidence of compassion in our ancestors, dating back hundreds of thousands of years, including in their care for disabled people. Love and empathy are what enable us to cooperate with complete strangers and create the social networks on which we all depend. These intergenerational systems, through which we also transmit our technological knowledge, are the scaffolding around which we weave our system of care and support for each other. The solution to our climate crisis lies in deploying this power. Dealing with the challenges of the climate emergency requires a strong society. None of us could survive alone. Social resilience involves creating stronger communities that care for one another in times of disaster. The acute crisis of the Covid pandemic showed us how communities could band together to protect the vulnerable. But this is no substitute for responsible governance. We must love ourselves enough to demand more of our leaders. This climate challenge demands a strong, responsive societal adaptation, which needs leadership and vision to build. As humanity faces its biggest challenge, we need to adapt our societies by retrieving the love for one another that is the very basis of our humanity.

{"title": "The road to net zero: Aberdeen looks to a future without oil", "article": "The oil companies know it. The car dealers selling top of the range Porsches get it, as do the hoteliers and the restaurateurs. Change is coming to Aberdeen: the UK centre of North Sea fossil fuel production since the 1970s is trying to avoid becoming the city of stranded assets. The Granite city became Scotland\u2019s boom town almost by accident. It was Dundee down the coast that was originally identified as a probable hub for offshore production when exploratory work established large reserves of oil and gas under the continental shelf. Aberdeen has never looked back. Kirsty Blackman, the MP for Aberdeen North and the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster spokesperson on the economy, says there are more cars with personalised number plates on the city\u2019s streets than anywhere else in the UK bar central London. Aberdeen is the one city where taxi drivers can quote the spot price for a barrel of crude oil. \u201cEverybody knows people who go offshore,\u201d Blackman says.\nYet the UK government\u2019s decision to target net carbon zero emissions by 2050, a deadline the Scottish government has advanced by five years, has forced a change of direction. As delegates descend on Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit, Aberdeen is looking to a future without fossil fuels. Sir Ian Wood, who became one of the country\u2019s wealthiest men through the oil and gas activities of his Wood Group, notes that crude production is barely one-third of the 4.5m barrels a day (B/D) at its peak, and will be down to just 400,000 B/D by 2050. He says the Wood Group is already diversifying out of oil and gas, which now account for just 25% of its activities. \u201cThe aim is to turn Aberdeen from the oil and gas region of Europe to the all-energy region of Europe,\u201d he says. Wood wants the city and the wider Grampian region to diversify into renewable energy life sciences, food and drink, the digital economy and tourism. A proposed energy transition zone \u2013 sited next to the city\u2019s new south harbour development \u2013 is expected to create 2,500 green sector jobs by 2030 in high-skills areas such as hydrogen manufacturing and refuelling facilities.\nSome say it has taken a long time for the penny to drop in Aberdeen. \u201cThey should have been thinking about this ages ago,\u201d says Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities thinktank. \u201cI never got the impression they were fully committed or serious about it.\u201d But Carter says Aberdeen is better placed to weather structural change to its local economy than other cities. \u201cOur data shows a pretty dynamic economy. Business startups are good. There is a fair-size stock of activities going on and more than 50% of people have a degree or higher. It is better placed than some one-industry towns, such as Sunderland were Nissan to leave.\u201d\nFraser Milne is the engineering and products director of the Balmoral Group, which was set up in 1980 when the oil boom was at its height. He says the company is now pivoting its subsea products business towards the renewables sector. At the moment 7% of Balmoral\u2019s \u00a3100m turnover is from the offshore wind sector, but Milne says: \u201cWe expect growth to be 30% in the next three years \u2013 possibly higher.\u201d Oil and gas account for at least one-third of the local economy once all the knock-on activities are taken into account. There was a time \u201cwhen every time the oil price went up the cowboy hats went back on again\u201d, says Russell Borthwick, the chief executive of the Aberdeen and Grampian chamber of commerce. The aim now is not just be a net zero city but to help other cities achieve net zero as well, he says. Ever since the first barrel of crude was brought ashore in 1975, oil has been a political issue, with a long-running dispute over whether the proceeds should go to Scotland or the UK. The argument now is over whether the 10bn-20bn barrels of crude that could be pumped should be left in the ground.\nThe Scottish Green party, which is in coalition with the SNP at Holyrood, wants the transition away from fossil fuels accelerated, with no further licences for North Sea oil production. The Greens say two-thirds of Scots back their plan to start winding down extraction, adding that the way ahead is to provide alternative futures for communities that rely on fossil fuels and not leave them \u201cwaiting until we\u2019ve extracted every last bit of oil\u201d.\nThe oil industry says the transition cannot be rushed without causing damage to jobs and increasing dependency on imported fossil fuels. Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of the trade body Oil & Gas UK, says steps are being taken to decarbonise the supply of oil and gas from the North Sea through carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen as a power source. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see us stop overnight because we have been there with the mining industry. We want it to be a glide path,\u201d she says. The Unite union has 9,000 members working offshore, and its regional organiser John Boland worries that few of them will find jobs servicing giant wind turbines. \u201cWe find ourselves in uneasy agreement with the industry,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has to be a transition but it has to be smooth and there have to be jobs at the end of it. There\u2019s a lot of talk about it but I am tempted to ask: what are the green jobs?\u201d\nWhere there is agreement is that investment in renewables needs to accelerated and transition needs to be planned. Phil Kirk, the chief executive Europe for Harbour Energy, the largest UK-listed independent oil and gas company, says the government must encourage the next generation of North Sea development \u2013 everything from hydrocarbon production and carbon capture and storage to floating wind turbines and green and blue hydrogen. \u201cIt is, I expect, a huge political regret that we missed out on a manufacturing windfall from wind. We have massively invested in wind but we don\u2019t make a lot of the kit here,\u201d Kirk says. \u201cTransition won\u2019t happen overnight unless we want to turn off the lights and shut down our industry and the hospitals. We are going to have plan carefully and understand the consequences of any hasty decisions \u2013 for the UK and not just for Aberdeen.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/01/the-road-to-net-zero-aberdeen-looks-to-a-future-without-oil", "last_update": "2021-10-31T21:57:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018This is the age of waste\u2019: the show about our throwaway addiction and how to cure it", "article": "How will this age be remembered? After the stone age, the bronze age, the steam age and the information age, what material or innovation will most define the current era? According to a new exhibition at the Design Museum, the most ubiquitous hallmark of the Anthropocene is not a gamechanging material, nor the mastery of technology. It\u2019s trash. \u201cWe are arguably living in the waste age,\u201d says Justin McGuirk, the London museum\u2019s chief curator, who has spent the last three years rifling through rubbish with co-curator Gemma Curtin to put together this timely show. \u201cThe production of waste is absolutely central to our way of life, a fundamental part of how the global economy operates. We wanted to show how design is deeply complicit in the waste problem \u2013 and also best placed to address it.\u201d Opening on the eve of the Cop26 climate summit, Waste Age is a powerful wake-up call, not so much to consumers, but to the manufacturers, retailers and, most crucially, government regulators. It is not intended to be a slap around the face for buying that takeaway coffee on your way to the museum, or forgetting your cotton tote bag yet again, but an eye-opening look at the sheer scale of the issue, and the people working on ingenious solutions. The exhibition begins with a useful reminder that we didn\u2019t get here by accident. Humans are not inherently wasteful creatures. Throwaway culture was something we had to learn \u2013 indeed, it was a lifestyle choice, marketed from the mid-20th century onwards as a decadent release, following the austerity of wartime. It was the intentional opposite of \u201cmake do and mend\u201d. One advert from the 1960s extolls the wonders of the new-fangled polystyrene cup: \u201cNew and very in! The party \u2018glass\u2019 you just enjoy \u2026 and throw away.\u201d It hangs next to a plastic carrier bag from the 1980s, printed with descriptions of its many advantages over paper. Little did we know that, four decades later, the world would be consuming more than a million plastic bags a minute.\nGenerating waste, the curators argue, has long been a primary engine of the economy. The history of the lightbulb is an illuminating case in point. In the 1920s, bulbs were so long-lasting that they were deemed commercially unviable. General Electric, Philips and others formed the Phoebus cartel in 1924 to standardise the life expectancy of lightbulbs at 1,000 hours \u2013 down from the previous 2,500 hours. And so the culture of planned obsolescence was born. Almost a century later, similar practices continue: last year Apple agreed to pay up to $500m, after it was accused of deliberately slowing down older phone models to encourage consumers to buy the latest handsets.\nA striking installation by Ibrahim Mahama brings home the reality of where such defunct electronics end up. He has erected a giant wall of old TV monitors that play clips from Agbogbloshie in Ghana, for many years the world\u2019s largest e-waste dump, where informal workers burn electrical cables to harvest the copper wire and other precious metals. Mahama has commissioned them to cast the salvaged metal in the form of TV screen surrounds, which frame footage showing this toxic process. The scenes are desperate, but the message is clear: waste is precious. About 7% of the world\u2019s gold supplies are trapped inside existing electronic devices, meaning that, according to some estimates, by 2080 the largest metal reserves will not be underground but in circulation as existing products. What\u2019s more, one tonne of extracted gold ore yields 3g of gold, whereas recycling one tonne of mobile phones yields 300g. So waste dumps and landfill sites are the new resource-rich mines. \u201cIn many ways \u2018waste\u2019 is a category error,\u201d says McGuirk. \u201cIt\u2019s often perfectly good material that\u2019s simply undervalued.\u201d The exhibition includes designers who are already working on what a future of \u201cabove-ground mining\u201d might look like, exploring how objects and buildings can be dismantled and their parts reused. There is the work of pioneering Belgian group Rotor, a team of architects who set up a demolition company to carefully remove materials and components from buildings slated for the wrecking ball.\nTheir Brussels warehouse brims with everything from marble slabs to vintage lamps, the spoils of what they call \u201cforestry in the city\u201d. It is shown alongside the refurbishment projects of French architects Lacaton & Vassal, for whom demolition is \u201ca waste of energy, a waste of material, a waste of history [and] an act of violence\u201d. At a time when global construction waste is set to double to 2.2bn tonnes a year by 2025, their joint calls to re-use what we already have couldn\u2019t be more urgent. In the consumer goods sphere, the re-use cause is championed by the likes of iFixit, an online global repair platform that publishes free repair guides and sells spare parts and tools, like a screwdriver to disassemble the iPhone. It has been lobbying governments for repairability legislation since 2003, with some success. France is the first country in Europe to implement a Repairability Index, adopted in January, which requires manufacturers to provide clear information on the repairability of smartphones, laptops, washing machines, televisions and lawnmowers, and award their products scores out of 10. The iPhone 11 may include some recycled rare earth elements, but it got a repairability score of 4.5 out of 10.\nThe final section of the exhibition moves beyond fixing and recycling to imagine a \u201cpost-waste\u201d world, where materials are grown rather than extracted. Design exhibition regulars might be familiar with the wonders of hempcrete or mycelium insulation, but this show includes a dazzling range of innovations, from water-soluble electronic circuit boards made of natural fibres, to \u201csea stone\u201d, a concrete-like material made from crushed seashells. Also featured are Sony\u2019s packaging made from bamboo and sugarcane (embossed rather than printed, to save ink waste), Notpla\u2019s seaweed-based sachets for liquids and condiments, a polystyrene substitute made from sunflowers, and a new kind of leather made from coconut water \u2013 alongside things made from algae, corn husks and organic pulps of all kinds. Such biodegradable solutions come with their own pitfalls: how many times have you thrown a plastic container in the recycling bin, before realising it was actually compostable Vegware? And should it go in the compost bin or landfill? Behaviour and expectations will have to adjust to meet the brave new bio-future. \u201cOur aesthetic sensibilities may have to adapt,\u201d McGuirk writes in the exhibition catalogue. \u201cAfter nearly a century of appreciating the hard-smooth-shiny perfection of plastics, we may begin to embrace irregularity, imperfection, decay and decomposition.\u201d Your future organo-laptop might not overheat, slow down, or need its battery constantly replaced. But it might start to go mouldy instead.

{"title": "A new start after 60: \u2018I decided to transition at 68\u2019", "article": "Sometimes one kind of pain can bring to light another. Stuck in hospital for a month, Petra Wenham resolved to confront an unease she had carried throughout her whole life. She was 68 and had lost 30kg as a result of severe colitis. \u201cMy family were very worried. I was evaluating my life.\u201d Between morphine injections, Wenham, a retired cybersecurity consultant, had time to wander online, where she found a blog whose author had decided to transition after treading on a shard of glass. Something about the way the pain, vulnerability and sense of mortality galvanised the blogger spoke to Wenham.\n\u201cI realised that your past \u2026 you look at it and realise all of the pain. You\u2019ve had all this pain and you really need to do something about it and at least get a bit more out of life,\u201d she says. In 2015, Wenham was discharged to await bowel surgery. \u201cI came out and my first thing to do was to sit down with my wife, Loraine. She knew that I did cross-dressing from before we were married. At the time we put it down to transvestite traits. We had no other knowledge. That odd bit of cross-dressing brings sufficient mental relief that you can carry on. But in the end it doesn\u2019t. You have to do something about it. I said to Loraine, \u2018Look, I believe I\u2019m transgender. This is what it means.\u2019\u201d Wenham believes Loraine probably understood the truth before Wenham herself did. This year they celebrated their 48th wedding anniversary, having married six months after their first date (a dinner at the Institution of Electrical Engineers). Wenham was only a little nervous proposing. \u201cWe were soulmates.\u201d And now? \u201cThe personality of the person doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Wenham says. \u201cI subscribe to the view that all of us love and love knows no gender or sex.\u201d\nTogether they joined a local support group. By the time Wenham referred herself to the London transgender clinic in October 2017, she was already living as a woman, though not fully out to all family and friends. Her children \u2013 two sons in their 40s \u2013 and grandchildren, still call her Dad and Grandad. \u201cThere is no point in confusing the kids. It might confuse the world, but that\u2019s fine,\u201d Wenham says. As a child, Wenham was shy. \u201cYou become a loner. As you go through school the society norm for gender starts kicking in and the girls start moving away from you because you are seen as a boy. Nevertheless, you are not part of the boy set.\u201d Now Wenham has found her voice. In July, she was the first transgender woman to grace the cover of WI Life, the Women\u2019s Institute magazine (as a member of the Cake and Revolution group in Suffolk). She has delivered many talks to other WI groups and local organisations, including NHS trusts, on her experience as a trans woman, and joined Pride marches. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly feel like an activist, although I\u2019ve sort of fallen into that role,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is trying to educate. I want to help people to get a better understanding of the transgender condition.\u201d Does she ever regret how long it took her to transition? \u201cIf the internet had been there when I was in my late teens, early 20s, would I have done it? The chances are yes, I probably would. But then again, I would have missed out on Loraine, the family, the grandchildren. It\u2019s a difficult call.\u201d Wenham never did need that bowel surgery. After she took probiotics, the colitis began to vanish. She and Loraine believe she was suffering from stress caused by decades of unacknowledged pain. \u201cBecause they never found a cause for my colitis. They were looking for some sort of infection. There wasn\u2019t one.\u201d Now, more than ever, she says, \u201cI\u2019m very, very comfortable in my skin.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/01/a-new-start-after-60-petra-wenham-transition-transgender", "last_update": "2021-10-28T14:51:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Instead, the headlines were about cutting the cost of short-haul flights.\u201d Her voice rises. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he was thinking: \u2018What can I do to send the worst signal ahead of this Cop?\u2019 If I were Alok Sharma [the president of Cop26 and Conservative MP], I would be extremely angry because it feels as if he is being undermined by his own government.\u201d She pauses, and gives a brittle laugh. \u201cSo objectively, it\u2019s quite hard, looking at the evidence, to feel optimistic.\u201d I had asked if Lucas felt positive about the summit, and she had given a long list of reasons why she didn\u2019t \u2013 including the government\u2019s slack approach to diplomacy, as host. She says Covid-19 has made it harder, but our efforts to get countries such as China on board still pale compared to what French politicians were doing ahead of the 2015 Paris conference. \u201cWe know that if you add up all of the different so-called nationally determined contributions \u2013 the individual countries\u2019 assessment of how much they are going to cut their emissions by \u2013 that ought to be a minimum 45% cut by 2030. And if you add up what we\u2019ve got so far, it\u2019s leading to a 16% increase. \u201cSo on the emissions reductions, we\u2019re not there. On the finance, we\u2019re not there. Since 2009, we\u2019ve said we will be providing $100bn to the developing countries by 2020, and we\u2019ve still not got to that amount either.\u201d On top of that, Lucas says, \u201cThe richer countries have not provided the [Covid] vaccines that they promised to poorer countries. I think the developing countries are going to arrive in Glasgow feeling incredibly let down.\u201d Still, she says, smiling as she speaks via Zoom from her home in Brighton, there are glimmers of hope. \u201cThe public pressure and movements are gathering like never before. We know the public want leadership on this \u2013 they want the government to go further, they are absolutely up for bolder and more ambitious action. I take some hope from that, but on the evidence right now, I think it\u2019s not too late, but it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Lucas has called Cop26 \u201cour last best chance\u201d. What will happen if it\u2019s not successful? \u201cThis is the moment where it feels like public pressure and awareness is at its greatest. We know that this decade is going to be just about the most consequential in human history if we are serious about the existential threat that the climate crisis poses to humanity. But I\u2019m also aware that if we don\u2019t get a good result, it doesn\u2019t mean we should all pack up, go home and give up. Every single fraction of a degree makes a difference in terms of climate impact, every single tonne of carbon emitted makes a difference. So we still have to keep fighting for the next best moment.\u201d\nLucas also knows we are running out of \u201cmoments\u201d. Her biggest fear is, \u201cThat we don\u2019t act fast enough. That we exceed 1.5 degrees, that we get towards two degrees of warming and more of the extreme events that scientists have been warning are linked to the climate emergency really accelerate.\u201d One of her favourite films is Franny Armstrong\u2019s docudrama The Age of Stupid, set in 2055 \u2013 with its cities under floods or on fire, it looks more familiar this year than it did when it came out in 2009 \u2013 and she says a line from it still makes the hairs stand up on the back of her neck: \u201c\u2018Why is it, knowing what we knew then, we didn\u2019t act when there was still time?\u2019 And frankly that is the question I go to bed thinking about, and wake up thinking about.\u201d Lucas was elected as the MP for Brighton Pavilion in 2010, and is still the country\u2019s first and only Green MP. She grew up in Malvern, where her father ran a small business \u2013 her parents were \u201cmost definitely Conservatives\u201d and politics wasn\u2019t part of her childhood. \u201cI came late to it,\u201d she says. As a bookish child, she was most interested in poetry and novels; she went on to do a PhD in 16th-century literary romance. In the early 80s, at university in Exeter, Lucas got involved with the anti-nuclear movement and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). \u201cThat\u2019s what got me into politics more broadly,\u201d she says. Although she never stayed at Greenham Common, visiting the protest \u201cwas my kind of introduction to the broader political world\u201d. When she worked in the CND bookshop in Exeter, Lucas read Jonathon Porritt\u2019s book Seeing Green, \u201cwhich put together concerns around the anti-nuclear movement with concerns around the women\u2019s movement and poverty and environmental policies. For the first time in my life, I saw some of the connections. It was a sort of a lightbulb moment, coming across that book and realising there was actually a political party that linked to these different symptoms of a wider problem, which is basically an economic model that puts profit and growth above people and planet.\u201d One of the problems environmental campaigners face, apart from terrifying us, is how to sell the big changes we all \u2013 or at least those with affluent lifestyles \u2013 need to make. This is one of Lucas\u2019s strengths, I think, because she is both clever and practical, and always seems pretty cheerful despite her dire warnings. On rampant consumerism, she says: \u201cPeople are still going to need \u2013 and want \u2013 to consume things but there\u2019s a lot of evidence to suggest that people get very frustrated, for example, when products have built-in obsolescence. A very popular policy that comes up again and again is a proper right to repair.\u201d It would be great to have repair cafes everywhere, she says, where you can get your broken toaster mended \u201cwhile you\u2019re having a coffee, chatting with friends\u201d. Not upgrading your phone every other year, she says, \u201cis not seriously going to undermine people\u2019s quality of life, but will give us a better chance of a life that\u2019s liveable for everybody into the future\u201d.\nThere are always ways to design fair policies \u201cthat people buy into\u201d, she says. Take flying, for example. \u201cThe citizens\u2019 assemblies came out really strongly for a frequent flyer levy. That means if you were to take one flight a year, it will be much the same price as it is now. But as soon as you start taking the second, third, fourth, fifth, the price ratchets up steeply \u2013 that reflects the fact that 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the population. It\u2019s a small number, relatively speaking, taking a hell of a lot of flights that is driving the biggest rise in emissions.\u201d What is frustrating, she says, is how so many of the policies that would also \u201cget us off our current collision course with catastrophe\u201d wouldn\u2019t be about giving things up, but about improving life. \u201cWhat is not to like about the vast majority of this agenda? Yet still we have governments who aren\u2019t moving in the right direction.\u201d The recently announced heat and buildings strategy \u2013 the one that said we should all have heat pumps \u2013 made Lucas furious, she says. Not only were the subsidies insufficient, but: \u201cThey put almost nothing into home insulation. It\u2019s utterly inefficient and wasteful, and doesn\u2019t work. If we had a comprehensive street-by-street, local authority-led home insulation programme, that would get people\u2019s fuel bills down, improve people\u2019s health, get climate emissions down, create millions of jobs all around the country. There are so many win-wins.\u201d It was the same with other green initiatives. \u201cIt feels like you cannot underestimate this government\u2019s ability to balls up good ideas,\u201d says Lucas. About Boris Johnson, she is scathing. \u201cHe\u2019s an absolute disaster as a prime minister. He doesn\u2019t do what is right, he does what he thinks is popular.\u201d On the Covid-19 crisis, \u201cIt has been so apparent that he waits until the last moment to act. He is utterly indecisive, doesn\u2019t want to be unpopular and doesn\u2019t want to take leadership. And, as a result, Britain has had one of the worst total death rates in the western world.\u201d It also makes Johnson, Lucas believes, \u201cuniquely ill-equipped to deal with a crisis like climate change, where you need public trust. At a time of crisis, whether that\u2019s Covid or climate, you need leaders who have integrity, consistency and courage. And those are three words I would not associate with Boris Johnson.\u201d As for the conference speech made by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, \u201cYou had to wait over an hour to get anything on climate and it felt like it was one issue among many that needed to be addressed. It wasn\u2019t the context within which all of those other announcements and decisions were being situated.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s messaging is all over the place, says Lucas. In the summer, the Cop26 spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, was mocked for saying people should take small steps to combat climate change (she acknowledged it was not the whole answer) such as not rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. Lucas laughs, incredulous. \u201cIt insulted people\u2019s intelligence \u2013 people know that the actions we need have to be commensurate to the scale of the crisis. You cannot say that this is the greatest threat to humanity, and then [advise] not rinsing dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. It\u2019s the inconsistency that is so debilitating.\u201d When Lucas boards the train to Glasgow this week, she says it will cost her four times more than if she were to take a cheap flight. \u201cLots of people aren\u2019t in the privileged position I\u2019m in to be able to say, \u2018OK, in spite of that, I\u2019ll go for that option.\u2019 So let\u2019s make it easier for people to do the right thing.\u201d Does she think there will be a Green government in her lifetime? She smiles. \u201cYes, I do. Because if there isn\u2019t, then unless there\u2019s a Damascene conversion of the other parties, the future is looking pretty grim. I\u2019m not saying that the Green party is the only party that has the answers, but we\u2019ve been asking the right questions for a hell of a lot longer.\u201d The party is hampered by the voting system: \u201cClearly, a change in the voting system is what is necessary before Greens can take the position I would say we should rightfully have, if you look at the level of support for the party.\u201d But it\u2019s also a party with divisions over issues such as gender, as well as its frequent leadership changes \u2013 Lucas, who was leader between 2008 and 2012, is still probably its only recognisable face \u2013 and complicated internal democracy. It had record local election results this year, but the Green party still looks far from a meaningful power.\nWhat does she think of Insulate Britain\u2019s tactics? Last week, the protest group, which is campaigning to insulate all British homes by 2030, blocked roads on to the M25. \u201cI think the tactics have become the story, so actually, we spend much less time talking about the need to insulate Britain and more time about whether or not it\u2019s legitimate to take the actions they are doing,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m absolutely a supporter of peaceful direct action, and have been arrested and acquitted myself for doing the same thing [in 2013 during a protest against fracking], I would feel more comfortable protesting on the issue of insulation outside the Treasury where they\u2019ve got the money to be putting into those programmes, rather than on the M25 where motorists don\u2019t have a lot of say over what policies get rolled out.\u201d One of the biggest lessons from her decades of environmental activism, she says, \u201cis that change can sometimes happen very suddenly and in unpredictable ways\u201d. Sometimes, change is almost overnight. One recent example was the government\u2019s U-turn over sewage spills last week, placing a legal duty on water companies to reduce sewage discharges into rivers and the sea from storm overflows. \u201cWe were told it was absolutely impossible to change, that it will cost far too much and, in any case, the government\u2019s policy was just fine. Then, within a matter of days, that changed. The thing that keeps you going is the idea that things can happen fast and sometimes you don\u2019t know what will bring about that breakthrough.\u201d Change, says Lucas, doesn\u2019t have to be slow. Which is just as well.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/caroline-lucas-on-climate-consumerism-and-cop26-boris-johnson-is-an-absolute-disaster", "last_update": "2021-10-29T17:03:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Industry lobbies against 2040 UK ban on new diesel trucks", "article": "The UK automotive industry is privately lobbying against the proposed 2040 introduction of a ban on sales of new diesel trucks, amid a split between manufacturers over when heavy goods vehicles should abandon fossil fuels. In July the government revealed plans to ban internal combustion engines in new lorries after 2040, following a ban on petrol and diesel cars after 2035 to help tackle the climate crisis. It is now consulting on the measure. The automotive lobby group, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), says publicly that the proposed ban is a \u201cbold commitment\u201d that would require financial support from the government. However, it has told MPs privately that a ban should be delayed, according to responses to the official consultation. The responses were obtained through a formal request by InfluenceMap, a thinktank that tracks climate lobbying, which shared them with the Guardian. The Road Haulage Association (RHA), which represents trucking companies, said the ban should be delayed until 2045 for lorries over 32 tonnes in weight. It supported earlier bans for smaller lorries. Some individual truckmakers do support bans on fossil fuel internal combustion engines in heavy goods vehicles in 2040 or earlier, the responses show. They include Volvo Trucks and Renault, both owned by Volvo Group, the world\u2019s second biggest truckmaker, as well as DAF Trucks and Tesla. Car sales are already moving rapidly to electric power, but heavy goods vehicles are much harder to electrify because of the heavy loads they carry over long distances, making batteries much less effective. Lorries were responsible for 19m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019, 16% of UK emissions from transport, according to government figures. Ben Youriev, a transport analyst at InfluenceMap, said: \u201cCutting emissions from road transport will be critically important for the UK achieving its net zero targets, yet the UK\u2019s automotive industry group is lobbying to make that task harder. The SMMT is siding with its most regressive members to oppose a 2040 UK phase-out date for heavy-duty vehicles, despite the recommendations of the UK\u2019s Climate Change Committee.\u201d The SMMT consultation response said: \u201cWithout clarity on the viable future solutions required for zero-emission HGVs, we do not support setting an end-of-sale date.\u201d It said the industry was committed to zero-emission HGVs \u201cwhere technology options are viable and the business case for investment allows\u201d, but that \u201csome specific use cases are likely to be more challenging\u201d.\nMike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement: \u201cSMMT and its members do not oppose setting an end-of-sale date, but we need plans before bans. The HGV sector is committed to be fossil fuel free by 2040 and in some use cases it will be possible to switch to zero-emission trucks before this date \u2013 but at present there is no clear alternative technology available for every single HGV operation.\u201d Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy at the RHA, said more time was needed for the largest lorries only because the technology to power them was not yet available. He said that would mean small delivery companies were faced with financial risks when buying new vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re against cleaner air or phasing out diesel lorries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question has always been the timescale.\u201d Tesla, the world\u2019s most valuable automotive company, was a notable advocate in its response for the earliest ban possible, arguing for 2035. Controlled by Elon Musk, whose stake has made him the richest man in history, Tesla is aiming to produce the Semi, a heavy goods vehicle powered by batteries. However, the Semi is still \u201cin development\u201d despite Musk in 2017 saying it would start production in 2019. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2021.

{"title": "The Tempest review \u2013 stirring all-female Shakespeare on the cusp of Cop26", "article": "The short-term forecast is for a storm \u2013 or maybe a squally shower \u2013 of Cop26-inspired Tempests. On 7 November, BBC Radio 3 is fielding a soft-spoken Ian McDiarmid as Prospero in Shakespeare\u2019s island reverie and here in Glasgow, as the climate delegates assemble, director Andy Arnold has put together an 11-strong, all-female Tempest, led by Nicole Cooper. Neither production overstates the eco connections, each preferring the story does its own work. This is a play about a man-made weather event leading to a bunch of Europeans taking over a foreign territory, exploiting it, then getting out again. The latter idea is picked up by Arnold, who leaves Itxaso Moreno\u2019s athletic Ariel and Liz Kettle\u2019s proud Caliban forlorn and abandoned at the end of the 90-minute show. They have been used and discarded, the dream-like visions of their visitors a lingering nightmare for them. The set by Jenny Booth, which gets an environmental tick for recycling prop-store furniture, places Cooper, dramatically, on the sill beneath one of the exposed stained-glass windows on the theatre\u2019s back wall. This is Prospero\u2019s high-level library, a vantage point to cast his spells over the supernatural inhabitants, the shipwrecked sailors and Titana Muthui\u2019s Miranda, a surly, eye-rolling teenager rather than the sweet-natured ingenue of tradition. There is something of the sociopath in Cooper\u2019s portrayal. This is a Prospero who is all charm and charisma when things are going his way, but step out of line and he turns vicious. Blaming Ariel for the sprite\u2019s own misfortunes feels like gaslighting. Abusing Caliban is the colonial mindset at its most arrogant. There are more reasons than adolescent hormones to make Miranda sceptical about her dad, a man who combines suave assurance and callous control. With Benny Goodman\u2019s lighting splashing fiery reds and stark whites from the wings, it is a dreamy, fluid production, but one that skates over some of the key moments. Where is the wonder when Miranda sets eyes on her first eligible man, or the shock when the sailors encounter Caliban? But if such transitions are underplayed, a show that boldly questions the means of production is also thoughtful and imaginative. The Tempest is at Tron theatre, Glasgow, until 13 November.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/01/the-tempest-review-stirring-all-female-shakespeare-on-the-cusp-of-cop26", "last_update": "2021-10-31T15:25:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "Twice as many youth services in England\u2019s richest areas \u2013 survey", "article": "Children in affluent areas of England are twice as likely to have access to youth clubs and other out-of-school activities as those in poorer locations, the first national snapshot of youth services in more than a decade has revealed. The gulf emerged in a survey by the National Youth Agency (NYA) of close to 8,500 organisations providing youth services including national groups such as the Boys\u2019 Brigade, the Woodcraft Folk, YMCA and the Marine Society & Sea Cadets, as well as councils. The majority of provision was offered by Scouts and Girlguiding.\nThe survey also found youth buildings are more than twice as likely to be purpose-built for or aimed towards young people in affluent areas than in deprived areas, where facilities are more likely to be shared. The survey, funded by the Youth Futures Foundation, comes after official figures last week showed that close to 13,000 children in England were identified by social services in 2020/21 as being at risk of criminal exploitation by gangs, which Anne Longfield, chair of the Commission on Young Lives described as \u201cextremely troubling\u201d. In the top 10% most affluent postcode areas there were twice as many youth groups compared as in the 10% most deprived, it found. The largest clusters of the most deprived areas in England are in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, the north-east, Yorkshire and parts of London. The most affluent postcodes, often suburban and rural, include ares in counties such as Berkshire, Cheshire and Devon. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week announced a settlement for youth services, badged as delivering \u201cup to 300 youth facilities\u201d but which youth leaders now fear could result in an overall reduction in funding previously pledged. The \u00a3560m offered over three years appears to include a \u00a3500m youth investment fund announced in 2019 and funding for the National Citizen Service, which offers residential trips to 16- and 17-year-olds. The NYA estimates \u00a31bn less is being spent on youth services annually than a decade ago. The YMCA has previously calculated that youth services in England have experienced a 73% real-terms funding cut from local authorities since 2010. \u201cThere needs to be equal access to youth provision and it shouldn\u2019t depend on postcode or [whether you live in] an affluent area,\u201d said Leigh Middleton, the chief executive of the NYA, who described the figures as \u201cvery stark\u201d. \u201cThe priority should be set by where the need is greatest and supporting all young people to have equal access to youth provision.\u201d The survey was dominated by responses from uniformed groups \u2013 45% were from Girlguiding and 41% from Scouts \u2013 but the NYA said while this may overstate their role in youth services, they are likely to account for a majority of provision. In total, 16% of the organisations that responded were local authority youth services, faith groups and smaller community organisations. The snapshot also revealed how demand for youth services that address mental health are being swamped by demand. Two-thirds of organisations supporting mental health, wellbeing and related issues had waiting lists, rising to three-quarters in the most deprived areas. By contrast, half of those offering physical health and sport had waiting lists. Waiting lists were longer for providers of almost all kinds of services in deprived areas, with almost half of organisations addressing youth employment having a waiting list in the poorest areas, compared with just over a quarter in the wealthiest ones. A DCMS spokesperson said: \u201cLast week we announced plans to invest \u00a3560m to make sure youth services get the support they need, and this includes funding the construction or refurbishment of up to 300 youth facilities in the most deprived areas of the country. \u201cWe also confirmed a \u00a3500m extension of our schemes to help young people find new opportunities and better paid work, over \u00a3200m to continue the holiday activities and food programme, and a further \u00a31.8bn to support schools\u2019 recovery from the pandemic and help the most disadvantaged pupils \u2013 which takes overall funding dedicated towards pupils\u2019 recovery to almost \u00a35bn.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2021.

{"title": "Country diary: Pale sunlight filters through the trees", "article": "The rain began before dawn, with heavy drops tearing at the moss on the roof and threatening to block the gutters and downpipes, which gurgled ominously. With little wind, the insistent thundery downpour dragged on until a faint line of light began to outline the eastern hills. My sleep confounded, I watched as the morning seeped into view through the mist hanging over the valley. Squally winds followed, stripping the first leaves from the beech trees and starting to dislodge the last of the apple crop. These final russets, swelling now from plentiful moisture, have been one of the beneficiaries of this wet early autumn. For some other apple varieties the rain came too late, and, added to the spring storms that damaged the setting fruit, the yields have been disappointing \u2013 with little scope for cider-making. Growing a number of different apple cultivars gives us some insurance against the vagaries of our unpredictable weather \u2013 they flower at different times, offering pollinators broader access, and respond to rain and drought in subtly different ways. If a season favours one variety, we will at least get the benefit of that part of the crop \u2013 while a monoculture might fail completely.\nAs the day progressed, the cloud thinned and pale sunlight began to filter through the trees, highlighting the turning leaves against the uncertain outlines of the hills beyond. Then, suddenly, brilliant sunshine escaped from behind a passing shower and a full rainbow emerged across the north-eastern sky.\nIn the fading light, more substantial banks of cloud began to build \u2013 bulky, dark and threatening. When the full moon rose over the Cambrian Mountains soon after nightfall, the freshly washed atmosphere, now almost devoid of dust, added barely any warmth to its colour \u2013 even close to the horizon.

At the time, the EHF described the shorts as \u201cimproper clothing\u201d.\nAt some point over the past month the IHF has quietly altered its regulations for beach handball, which now stipulate that \u201cfemale athletes must wear short tight pants with a close fit\u201d.

It follows a campaign by Norway-based Australian activist Talitha Stone, whose petition \u2013 supported by gender equality organisation Collective Shout \u2013 attracted 61,000 signatures. \u201cI hope this is the beginning of the end of sexism and objectification of women and girls in sport,\u201d said Stone, who led Collective Shout\u2019s 2012 campaign against the Lingerie Football League. \u201cAnd that in future all women and girls will be free to participate in sport without fear of wardrobe malfunctions and sexual harassment.\u201d\nIn July, US pop star Pink threw her support behind the Norwegian team, tweeting her pride in them \u201cprotesting the very sexist rules\u201d and offering to pay their fines. The country\u2019s minister for culture and sport, Abid Raja, described the ruling as being \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d and women\u2019s sports associations across Europe also called for the resignation of the presidents of both the IHF and the EHF. Last month, the sports ministers from five European countries \u2013 Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland \u2013 wrote a joint letter to the IHF urging them to update archaic dress regulations \u201cnot only to accommodate current female athletes, but also to support and encourage all athletes regardless of their gender or background to remain in sport\u201d. At the time, the IHF rules stated that female players playing beach handball must wear \u201ctops and bikini bottoms and eventual accessories\u201d, while male players wear \u201ctank tops and shorts and eventual accessories\u201d.\nEven now, there are differences in terms of requirements for women to wear uniforms that are \u201cbody fit\u201d and \u201ctight\u201d when there is no corresponding rule for men. Female athletes have spoken out against uniform double standards numerous times. Women are required to wear more revealing outfits in several sports, including track and field, beach volleyball and tennis. In 2011, the Badminton World Federation decreed that women must wear skirts or dresses to play at the elite level in order to help revive flagging interest in women\u2019s badminton. A decade later, in July this year, double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen said she was left speechless and outraged after being told that her competition briefs were \u201ctoo short and inappropriate\u201d by an official while competing at the English Championships a few weeks before the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/01/handball-federation-changes-uniform-rules-after-pressure-over-sexist-bikini-rule", "last_update": "2021-11-01T05:58:04Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Christian Porter to be formally asked to explain declaration that \u2018blind trust\u2019 helped pay his legal fees", "article": "Liberal MP Christian Porter will be formally asked by a powerful parliamentary committee to explain his declaration that legal fees for his defamation case were part-paid by a trust with funds from unknown sources. Guardian Australia understands the privileges committee decided last week to write to Porter offering him a right of reply to a complaint from shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, that the former attorney general\u2019s failure to declare the ultimate source of funds breached disclosure rules. The committee also confirmed to Dreyfus it is considering the complaint.\nBoth moves suggest that despite the Morrison government using its House of Representatives majority to defeat a motion to refer the issue, the member for Pearce\u2019s declaration is nevertheless being scrutinised. On Monday a spokesperson for Porter told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe member will respond to any correspondence received from the committee in due course.\u201d In September, Porter disclosed that the \u201cLegal Services Trust\u201d had part-paid fees arising from the private defamation case he instigated against the ABC. The former attorney general said that as a \u201cpotential beneficiary\u201d of what he described as a blind trust he had no access to information about the source of the funds. The Dreyfus complaint, sent on 18 October, noted that the register requires gifts worth more than $750 to be declared and that, despite Porter\u2019s disclosure, the House has no idea who or what the ultimate sources of funds were. In parliamentary debate, Labor\u2019s Tony Burke labelled the trust a \u201cbrown paper bag stitched together by lawyers\u201d. Burke noted Porter\u2019s public assurances that no \u201cforeign donors\u201d or people on the lobbyist register had donated to the trust. \u201cSo he has made clear that he can find out whose money is in this trust, from which he has personally benefited for a personal bill,\u201d Burke said. Dreyfus\u2019s letter similarly argued that Porter\u2019s reasons for not disclosing are not valid, and queried whether he had \u201cacted contrary to House resolutions on the registration of members\u2019 interests\u201d. Porter maintains he has properly disclosed his interests in accordance with both the rules and the ministerial standards, but resigned as a minister in September on the basis the issue had become an \u201cunhelpful distraction\u201d for the government. On the day he resigned, Porter said in a statement he was \u201cnot willing to put pressure on the trust to provide me with any further information \u2026 to which I am not entitled\u201d. Porter said he did not want to expose people who donated to the trust to \u201cbecome targets of the social media mob\u201d.\nThe leader of the House, Peter Dutton, has asked the privileges committee to consider clarifying the rules around disclosure of donations for legal cases, a request that could encompass consideration of how members are interpreting the rules, but did not ask for a ruling on Porter\u2019s declaration. Because Dreyfus\u2019s complaint accused Porter of breaching the rules, the committee resolved, in line with standard procedure, to offer him a right of reply. The committee also received a written complaint from the Greens senator Larissa Waters. The committee has not ruled out making findings against individual MPs. In considering whether to allow debate on the motion to refer Porter, the former speaker Tony Smith found there was a \u201cprima facie case\u201d to investigate Porter for an alleged breach, but added that \u201cdoes not imply a conclusion that a breach of privilege or contempt has occurred\u201d. In October Scott Morrison sought to manage fallout from the government blocking the attempted referral of Porter, by insisting the broader consideration of clarifying rules around disclosure when members are faced with defamation proceedings would look into the controversy. \u201cThe suggestion that somehow things are not being looked into, that things have not been referred to [the committee], is not the case,\u201d Morrison told the House in question time. \u201cWe\u2019ve referred these matters directly to the chair of the privileges committee to consider these issues.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/christian-porter-to-be-formally-asked-to-explain-declaration-that-blind-trust-helped-pay-his-legal-fees", "last_update": "2021-11-01T04:32:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Text anxiety: why too many messages make us want to throw our phones at the wall", "article": "When Senait Lara, a 28-year-old video producer in Los Angeles, was confronted by her friends about her lack of communication in their group chat, the accusations were as follows: she only caught up every few days; when she did, it was barely an interaction \u2013 Lara spent time \u201chearting\u201d messages instead of responding with words; and sometimes she would never respond at all. Lara did not deny it. She knew she sometimes preferred to throw her phone in a corner and completely avoid it rather than deal with the onslaught of requests.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Lara addressed her behaviour in therapy that she realized she felt anxious from texting because of her tendency to please those around her. As her therapist described, people-pleasers are less likely to have boundaries around communication, which smartphones barely provide. \u201cI never understood why I would be so difficult to communicate with, but then I realized it was all online,\u201d she said. In person, Lara felt comfortable talking with people, but when communication came down to a text message, an email, or a direct message, she wanted to tap out. While social media and messaging apps claim to keep us more connected to each other, many younger users are finding themselves exhausted from receiving constant notifications, balancing numerous exchanges at once, and carrying conversations that can last all day \u2013 and sometimes over the course of a week. The after-effect? Delayed responses, forgetting to get back to someone entirely, and a need for frequent phone breaks. In fact, a 2020 study exploring the effects of information overload and online conversation dynamics found that \u201cover-exposure to information can suppress the likelihood of response by overloading users, contrary to analogies to biologically-inspired viral spread\u201d. It makes sense that millennials are feeling extremely overloaded. While social media use has increased among older adults, they are less likely to use multiple social media platforms, or to highly engage in them, making them less susceptible to technological burnout. Instead, studies show that older generations use social media platformsto keep up with family and to compensate for missed in-person interactions, rather than branding themselves or seeking opportunities, which results in less time and less engagement. Some avoid social media platforms completely because of technological disadvantages or fear of security breaches. Millennials, on the other hand \u2013 people born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s \u2013 have been described as the burnout generation. It\u2019s a generation that has matured in a technological world that allows for work, information, and communication to follow them everywhere. Throw in the increase we have seen in ways to communicate since the pandemic and you have gridlock. People are overwhelmed. From Zoom meetings and FaceTime dates to Slack blurring the lines between work and casual chat, connecting online has grown rapidly since 2019. There was a 61% increase in social media engagement during the first wave of the pandemic, and that wasn\u2019t just for the love of it: 73% of users expressed a negative sentiment towards social media in the past year. With vaccination rollouts and pandemic precautions easing, there is some relief on the horizon, but people are feeling burned out from spending much of 2020 online. The average American has 47 unread text messages and 1,602 unopened emails. And yet, the average phone screen time for American adults is 4.2 hours per day \u2013 more than ever before. This suggests people are spending more time on their phones, and still have less time to complete conversations. Now people are faced with social media apps like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook which encourage interaction through likes and shares; instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Messenger, which encourage long threads of conversation and group chats; and the traditional forms of communication like email and text messaging. The resulting number of conversations is almost unbelievable: the average person checks their phone 262 times a day, a major increase from the 80 times a day average in 2016. The frequent digital contact leaves people feeling overwhelmed and unable to participate at all. Like ghosting a date \u2013 common on dating apps, where it\u2019s the norm to have many conversations going at once \u2013 people stop responding to acquaintances, loved ones and friends. Emily Balcetis, an associate professor of psychology at New York University, recommends creating communication boundaries to manage the onslaught. This might include investing in an old-school alarm clock to have by your bedside so you can leave your phone charging in another room, or having cut-off times for email communication. Switching off around bedtime hours, she says, means \u201cyou can give your brain a break before you fall asleep and have a gentler start to the day.\u201d On email, people increasingly feel obliged to be constantly responsive, especially when all sorts of assumptions are made based on your email etiquette \u2013 like how much of a \u201ccompetitive edge\u201d one has. Balcetis suggests deciding on a reasonable window of time to check on and respond to emails, and using email signatures to flag in-office hours and days you don\u2019t check emails. Smartphones have quickly transformed into handheld storage units for our conversations, thoughts,music and everything else. That shift to feeling constantly attached to our phones as if they were a limb, relates to the burnout, says Balcetis. Now there\u2019s an app for everything, and with most apps come push notifications and ways to connect with other users, even when communication isn\u2019t the leading purpose of the app.\nTake Glow for example, a period and fertility tracker app. The app, which functions as a calendar, also encourages users to join group chats to compare experiences with its community of over 15 million women. Everything from fitness apps like Strava to recipe apps like BigOven encourage people to do the same. We could all just opt out of push notifications, but an unspoken obligation remains: to always be available as long as your phone is within reach. Ultimately, it boils down to belonging, which Balcetis says is an inherent need for humans. People have a sense of fomo \u2013 a fear of missing out \u2013 when they are not engaged. The term was originally popularized to reference anxiety about missing social events, but with smartphones acting as our society\u2019s primary mode of communication, this has extended to being online. It speaks to why Lara\u2019s friends felt rejected by her lacklustre responses: they sent a distorted message to her friends, that she was not invested in their relationships. According to Balcetis, the negativity dominance effect \u2013 our brain\u2019s natural tendency to intensify perceived negativity or threats \u2013 results in this assumption. \u201cAny sort of negative feedback, which can take the form of just non-responsiveness; people not putting a heart on something; or somebody not responding quickly enough, is going to loom large in our mind\u2019s eye and have a disproportionate impact on our wellbeing,\u201d Balcetis explained. Once Lara was able to accept her uncomfortable relationship with her phone, she started to tell her friends that she steps away from it at times, which has led to some friendships weakening \u2013 but others fared better. As smartphones have become essential devices, adaptions are constantly made to help users connect faster, and more frequently. In 2016, Apple launched Tapbacks, or emoji reactions for messages. Instead of responding with a written text, people can now place a heart, a thumbs up, a thumbs down, a \u2018\u201chaha!\u201d, a double exclamation point, or a question mark on a text message. Similarly, Instagram this year implemented sticker reactions to Stories. The update allows users to react to a story with laughing, surprised, heart eyes, teary-eyed, clap, fire, celebration or the 100 emoji. These features allow users to respond to someone\u2019s post or message in less than a second. It also means opening communication with people we wouldn\u2019t hold conversations with in person, blurring the lines between who is a friend and who is just an acquaintance. Kirsten Chen, a 24-year-old creative editor in New York, describes the outreach from people she isn\u2019t close to, mostly frivolous connections on social media, as annoying and entitled. \u201cAll of these people are asking me for so many things and think that they know me on this level where they get access to me,\u201d she says. The constant communication also makes her feel guilty: \u201cI would like to help as many people as I can, and be a good friend or acquaintance, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to deal with all y\u2019all,\u201d she explains. Chen\u2019s response rate is reflective of who is most relevant to her. If the message isn\u2019t urgent, but comes from someone she talks to frequently, she might respond in six to 10 hours. And if the message is from someone she isn\u2019t interested in or is about something she doesn\u2019t care about, it could be a few days or a week before she offers a response. Even with this method, she\u2019s recently racked up 12,460 unopened emails, 182 unread texts, and an unmeasurable number of Instagram DMs.\nTo some people, the sight of multiple unread notifications can trigger feelings of anxiety. Kevin Schoenblum, a 25-year-old UR designer in Washington, mass deletes emails and text messages once a week to avoid the red unread bubble on their phone screen. Sometimes it results in missing messages. \u201cThe idea that I owe a response to someone or that someone\u2019s waiting to hear back from me creates this cycle of guilt and shame and stress,\u201d they said. Fortunately, those who are close to Schoenblum are aware of their communication habits and don\u2019t expect immediacy in response time unless it\u2019s urgent. Recently diagnosed with ADHD, Schoenblum says the diagnosis gave them more understanding as to why notifications do not hold their attention as much as seeing someone\u2019s face and hearing their voice. As the pressure to be online and always available continues to grow in our society, in-person interactions provide far more authentic communication than digital ones. From body language and tone of voice to eye contact and all the other social cues that exist in real life that aren\u2019t available in a text message, it\u2019s far easier to be present when you\u2019re face-to-face. As Balcetis notes: \u201cAt the end of the day, I think what we\u2019re looking for is not more ways to stay connected, but higher quality ways to be connected.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/01/phones-texting-anxiety-messages-communication", "last_update": "2021-11-01T17:36:03Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Arrest after man dressed as Joker injures 17 in Tokyo train attack", "article": "A suspect has been arrested for attempted murder after 17 people were injured in a knife and fire attack on a train in Tokyo that was carried out by a man wearing a Joker costume. Witnesses told public broadcaster NHK how petrified passengers had fled to adjoining carriages and jumped out of windows during the attack, which occurred on Sunday, when the Japanese capital was full of Halloween revellers, many in costume. The suspect, who has been named as 24-year-old Kyota Hattori, told police he \u201cadores\u201d the Joker character from the Batman films, according to the Kyodo news agency. He was quoted by police as saying he had wanted to kill multiple people and receive the death penalty, it added. Photos and videos posted on social media showed a man wearing a green shirt and purple suit. He allegedly attacked passengers on the Keio Line train with a knife and started a fire inside the carriage using lighter fluid. Kyodo said a male passenger in his 70s was in critical condition after being stabbed in the chest. Sixteen other people suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation. Top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno described the incident as \u201catrocious and brutal\u201d on Monday. A video clip published by NHK showed panicked passengers running down the train as smoke filled the carriage, with flames also visible. Another video posted on Twitter showed people climbing through windows to escape the train at a station. The line operator said services had been partially suspended after \u201can incident involving injuries\u201d took place just before 8pm near Kokury\u014d in the city\u2019s western suburbs. The express train had been bound for Shinjuku, the world\u2019s busiest railway station. \u201cAt first I thought it was something like a Halloween event. But I rushed away as a man carrying a long knife came in. I was very fortunate not to be injured,\u201d a man who was on the train told NHK. The perpetrator showed no emotion during the attack, a female passenger said. \u201cHe held a knife and started spreading liquid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was committing this act without showing any emotion, just mechanically. I think that brought fear to everyone.\u201d\nDozens of firefighters and police officers were seen working outside the station. Violent crime is rare in Japan, but in August nine people were wounded, one of them seriously, in a stabbing on a commuter train in Tokyo, with the suspect fleeing the scene and later handing himself in. In a separate attack in August, two people suffered burns in an acid attack at a Tokyo subway station. Japan has strict gun laws, but there are occasional violent crimes involving other weapons. In 2019, a man killed two people, including a schoolgirl, and wounded more than a dozen in a rampage that targeted children as they waited for a bus. And in 2018, a man was arrested in central Japan after stabbing one person to death and injuring two others on a bullet train.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/man-dressed-as-joker-arrested-tokyo-train-attack", "last_update": "2021-11-01T05:10:53Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "New Zealand plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions criticised as an \u2018accounting trick\u2019", "article": "Climate change experts have warned that New Zealand has employed \u201caccounting tricks\u201d to create a target for greenhouse gas emissions cuts that looks far more ambitious than it really is. On Sunday the country pledged to halve its emissions by 2030 aspart of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5C. The announcement was made on the eve of the United Nations Cop26 climate conference. The previous target, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), was to reduce emissions by an average of 30% from 2005 levels, over the 2021-2030 period.\nThe updated NDC, has a target of reducing net emissions by 50% below the gross 2005 levels come 2030, or to reduce average annual net emissions over the next decade to 41% below 2005 gross levels. The target roughly aligns with commitments by the European Union, Newsroom reports, the primary difference being that the European Union aims to reduce most of its emissions within its own borders. New Zealand, on the other hand, expects that less than a third of its emissions will be reduced onshore. While New Zealand\u2019s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high and it is one of the world\u2019s worst performers on emission increases. Emissions in New Zealand rose 57% between 1990 and 2018 \u2013 the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries. Earlier this year, data showed New Zealand\u2019s emissions had increased by 2% in 2018-19. The Climate Action Tracker has given the country a \u201chighly insufficient\u201d rating, pointing out that despite net-zero emissions by 2050 being enshrined in law, the government\u2019s policies focus too heavily on offsetting carbon overseas and through forestry, rather than addressing the root causes such as agriculture. Bill Hare, from Climate Analytics, a partner organisation to Climate Action Tracker said New Zealand\u2019s latest announcement employs \u201cvarious accounting tricks\u201d.\n\u201cThe headline target that the government has put forward as a 50% reduction from 2005 levels of emissions is what the general public hears, however the government has taken a number of unusual accounting approaches that, when analysed, indicate that the real emission reductions achieved compared to 2005 levels of net emissions is only 22-23%,\u201d he said. \u201cThe allowed net emissions in 2030 are calculated as a percentage of gross emissions in 2005, essentially comparing apples and oranges. Gross emissions in 2005 was significantly higher than 2005 emissions.\u201d Global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, David Tong, said it was similar to the difference between looking at gross income, and pay after tax. \u201cWhat\u2019s been compared is a total emissions in 2005, to our total emissions, if we achieve this target, in 2030, less the sequestration from forestry and other carbon sequestration within New Zealand. So those are two different data sets.\u201d Part of the problem, is that the government is using Kyoto Protocol accounting rules, which have become less common, rather than the International Panel on Climate Change data method. \u201cIf you want to compare our targets to what is necessary for 1.5C, as both the prime minister and minister James Shaw have done, then it\u2019s really important that you use the same numbers as the world\u2019s top scientists,\u201d he said. Professor Bronwyn Hayward, from the University of Canterbury and an author for the IPCC report, said Climate Action Tracker has long argued that if New Zealand\u2019s commitments are to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u02daC, the country should set a 2030 target to reduce gross emissions by at least 44%. \u201cWhat we have done instead is to set an estimated net target of 41%. There will now be political debate about whether this meets the 1.5 target.\u201d Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Inc spokesperson, James Every-Palmer QC, said that while the target sounded good and is a significant improvement on the current NDC, it is not as good as it sounds. \u201cThe climate does not care about our clever accounting choices, it cares about the level of net emissions. And our failure to walk-the-talk will be apparent to our trading partners in our United Nations framework convention on climate change reporting.\u201d The climate minister James Shaw said while the first priority was to reduce emissions domestically, the country will also boost its emissions reductions through buying overseas carbon credits. \u201cWe will then add to this by working to reduce emissions in other parts of the world. The priority here will be to support developing countries in the Asia-Pacific to meet their sustainable development goals. But Professor Ralph Sims, from Massey University said: \u201cforest sinks only buy us time, and buying international credits is yet to be agreed under Paris COP rules and remains questionable with double-counting a risk\u201d. Forest and Bird\u2019s chief executive Kevin Hague said the government was relying too heavily on other countries to do the work. \u201cUnless the government delivers a much better plan to cut emissions that what we have seen so far this target will be mostly met by buying carbon credits from other countries. That\u2019s a government subsidy to polluters like the dairy industry.\u201d With the target set, and the country\u2019s emissions reduction plan due in May 2022, the most important thing now was for action to back up the ambitions, Hayward said. \u201cIt\u2019s meeting them that is the big challenge as we work to make these cuts to our emissions real in all sectors of the economy, and to dramatically increase our efforts to protect people and businesses from increasingly chaotic climate futures.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/new-zealand-plan-to-halve-greenhouse-gases-criticised-as-an-accounting-trick", "last_update": "2021-11-01T04:45:25Z", "source": "Guardian"},

{"title": "So many Indigenous Australians are arrested and jailed, but this doesn\u2019t solve anything | Ash Dahlstrom for Indigenous X", "article": "If you grew up in an Indigenous community, you would have heard someone say, \u201cthey\u2019re out today, aren\u2019t they?\u201d And you would ask, who? And they would reply, \u201cthe cops.\u201d You would have this interaction with different people throughout the week, and it would sometimes feel like the police never leave. Our communities are still some of the most impoverished in Australia. Why do Indigenous people keep being represented in the criminal justice system at a higher rate than non-Indigenous people? Does policing Indigenous communities work?\nThe New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (2016) tells us that between 2001 and 2015, the number of Indigenous people in NSW prisons doubled. The rise was a result of higher rates of arrest resulting in conviction, a greater likelihood of being sent to prison given the conviction, and a higher rate of being refused bail, the research found. If all these people are being arrested and sent to prison, why are our communities still over-policed, and why has nothing in our communities changed? Why are crimes still being committed? It\u2019s simple: police patrols do not reduce crime. Controlled trials in the US have found that while police patrols are effective at improving the image of the local police force, they are not effective at reducing crime. Moreover, hotspot policing has been shown to have adverse effects on communities. When an area is over-policed, it becomes stigmatised and associated with delinquency. We do not need to be told that our people are committing crimes in our community \u2013 we live there, we know who are committing these crimes. They are our sons, daughters, cousins, uncles, aunties, and we still love them. Police officers may arrest the ones we love, but it does not solve the underlying cause of why crime is committed, which is poverty. Wherever there is poverty, there are high property and petty crime rates. These crimes are committed out of necessity, not malice intent. For 60,000 years, we had our own set of laws and punishments. Still, in the last 200 years, we have had a legal system imposed on to us from the other side of the world. The results have been catastrophic. Indigenous adults are 12.5 times more likely to be incarcerated, Indigenous children are 26 times more likely to be incarcerated, Indigenous women are becoming the fastest-growing prison population in Australia, and more than 470 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have died in custody. What is the answer? Indigenous communities are aware of the complexity associated with crime. The perspective of our people should be considered when our Mob are sent to stand before the judge. Our communities must also be permitted to identify critical issues and implement culturally informed solutions that will keep Indigenous people out of jail and be a part of our community without the stigmatisation of having been sent to prison.\nSo does deploying police officers in our communities work? The answer is no. It does not combat poverty; it just results in overrepresentation, incarceration and death. There is so much to be proud of in our communities, such as kinship, culture, being able to pop around to anyone\u2019s house for a cuppa tea. But this isn\u2019t how our communities are portrayed to the general public. I\u2019ve had white friends tell me they\u2019re not allowed to travel to \u201cthat\u201d part of town because that\u2019s where all the crime happens. This is just blatantly false and racist. Crime can and does happen in every community, from North Sydney to Moree. Still, it isn\u2019t the white-collar criminals committing tax fraud demonised by the media and general public. It is us. \u2022 Ash Dahlstrom is a Gamilaraay and Ngarabal man from Moree in NSW, who is passionate about police reform and Indigenous rights, and is an Indigenous student advisor at Western Sydney University.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/01/so-many-indigenous-australians-are-arrested-and-jailed-but-this-doesnt-solve-anything", "last_update": "2021-11-01T03:07:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Maguire instructed Berejiklian to \u2018get a private phone\u2019 after being called before Icac", "article": "Icac has heard Daryl Maguire told then premier Gladys Berejiklian to get a \u201cprivate phone\u201d and use the Chinese instant messaging app WeChat in the days after he was first summonsed to appear before the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog because, he told her \u201cthey can read texts\u201d. But Berejiklian denied that the request made her suspect Maguire may have been involved in any corrupt conduct, telling the Independent Commission Against Corruption that it was \u201cnormal human nature\u201d not to want \u201cyour private conversations being listened to\u201d. On the final day of Icac\u2019s public hearings into her conduct, Berejiklian was grilled by counsel assisting the commission, Scott Robertson, on her actions in the days after Maguire first revealed to her that the watchdog had called him to appear as a witness in a separate investigation.\nIcac previously heard that on 5 July 2018 Maguire told Berejiklian he had been summonsed to appear before Icac during a 52-minute conversation. During the conversation, played before Icac on Friday, Berejiklian asked repeated questions about the nature of Maguire\u2019s involvement in the probe, and described some developers involved in that separate investigation as \u201cdodgy\u201d. When Maguire raised the prospect that their phone calls might be tapped, she asked: \u201cis that going to be a problem?\u201d A key plank of Icac\u2019s investigation is whether Berejiklian breached the state\u2019s Icac Act by failing to report conduct by Maguire she had reason to suspect on \u201creasonable grounds\u201d may have been corrupt. She has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and on Friday told Icac the phone call did not raise suspicions because \u201che told me he\u2019d done nothing wrong and I believed him\u201d. On Monday, Robertson took Berejiklian to the days between the 5 July phone call and Maguire\u2019s appearance before Icac eight days later. He revealed that four days later, on 9 July, Maguire sent a text to Berejiklian instructing her to download the Chinese messaging app WeChat, telling her: \u201cyou need to get a private phone\u201d. \u201cThey can read texts but not the little green man, leaves no trace,\u201d he wrote, in an apparent reference to the green WeChat icon. In another message, Maguire told the then premier that he had \u201cgot more info and data than them\u201d, using an emoji that Robertson described as a \u201cbeaming face with smiling eyes\u201d. Berejiklian again denied that the text messages raised concerns with her, saying it was common for MPs to have \u201ctwo phones\u201d and that she believed Maguire was concerned about \u201cprivacy\u201d. She said she had not acted on his suggestion to get a private phone. Questioned on whether she thought it was \u201ccurious\u201d that in the days after telling her he had been summonsed to appear before Icac, Maguire wanted her to get a private phone, Berejiklian said that was \u201ccertainly not my recollection\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken it as any more than privacy issues,\u201d she told Robertson. \u201cI was very confident that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And I was certainly confident that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d After Maguire appeared before Icac on 13 July 2018, he was forced to move to the crossbench, eventually resigning after the watchdog revealed he had discussed the possibility of earning commissions on the sale of development sites which he wanted to help broker. Icac made no corruption findings in relation to Maguire but recommended he face charges for allegedly giving false evidence.\nFollowing his evidence, Berejiklian released a statement saying the MP had \u201clet down\u201d his constituents and urging him to consider stepping down from the parliament. She told Icac that she was \u201cmortified\u201d after he gave evidence, saying the \u201cshock of what happened made me question everything\u201d including whether Maguire might have lied to her. But under questioning from Robertson, Berejiklian again denied his evidence meant that she suspected he may have engaged in corrupt conduct, saying only that there was a \u201ccloud\u201d around him and that she did not \u201cjoin the dots\u201d with information he had previously given her about hoping to make $1.5m from a Badgerys Creek land deal. \u201cThe question I asked myself was did I know anything [and] the answer very strongly in my mind is that I didn\u2019t know anything about what this commission was looking at,\u201d she said. Pressed on why she did not at least report the 5 July phone call she said: \u201cI had nothing to report. There was nothing that I knew, nothing that I remembered, nothing that I thought was of any relevance.\u201d Monday marked the final day of Icac\u2019s public hearings into Berejiklian\u2019s conduct, which has been centred on her role in the awarding of two grants which Maguire had lobbied for as an MP: $5.5m for a shooting range and conference centre in 2017, and $30m for a conservatorium of music, both in his seat of Wagga Wagga. ICAC is investigating whether she \u201cbreached the public trust\u201d by failing to declare her relationship with Maguire. She has denied any wrongdoing.\u201d Icac has previously heard evidence Maguire and Berejiklian remained in contact following his resignation in July, including a phone call in which she told him that she would \u201cthrow money\u201d at his seat during the by-election prompted by his resignation. In a series of recordings taken from tapped phone conversations between the couple, Berejiklian told Maguire that funding for one of two grants at the centre of the probe was a \u201cdone deal\u201d after he complained about \u201croadblocks\u201d on his \u201cmoney projects\u201d. \u201cI know but you\u2019re still getting everything. We ticked off your conservatorium the other day, that\u2019s a done deal now,\u201d Berejiklian told Maguire about a grant to fund the relocation of the Riverina Conservatorium of Music during a phone call in 2017. On Monday she conceded that he had encouraged her to support the project, but denied that was the reason for her government\u2019s decision to give $20m to fund the second stage of the project despite some within her office and the public service not supporting it. Berejiklian told Icac it was a \u201chigh-level, strategic\u201d decision to fund the project, based on her belief that it enjoyed a lot of community support. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon during by-elections to make announcements that are going to get you wide support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a regular political activity that governments try to win seats, try to keep their seats, as does an opposition. I don\u2019t think it would be a surprise to anybody that we throw money at seats to keep them.\u201d After the commission had adjourned, commissioner Ruth McColl said lawyers for the parties would present written submissions before the release of her final report into both the conduct of Maguire and Berejiklian. There is no timetable for the release of the report. Outside the commission Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney that \u201cevery decision I took was in the public\u2019s best interest\u201d. \u201cI stand by that today stronger than ever, and I just want to say to everybody that it\u2019s been my honour and privilege to serve you in my role in public life,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say too much more than that at this stage, just to say, obviously, what\u2019s occurred to me is a difficult situation but I know many people do it tough in the community. \u201cAnd now I intend to get on with my life and I just, again, want to thank everybody for their support.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/maguire-instructed-berejiklian-to-get-a-private-phone-after-being-called-before-icac", "last_update": "2021-11-01T04:51:09Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ruling party of Fumio Kishida wins comfortable victory in Japanese election", "article": "Japan\u2019s ruling conservative party defied expectations in Sunday\u2019s general election, with a comfortable victory that will boost the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, as he attempts to steer the economy out of the coronavirus pandemic. Kishida\u2019s Liberal Democratic party secured 261 seats in the 465-member lower house \u2013 the more powerful of Japan\u2019s two-chamber Diet \u2013 slightly down on its pre-election 276 seats. The party and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, together won 293 seats, more than the 261 required for an \u201cabsolute stable majority\u201d that gives them command of parliamentary committees, making it easier to pass bills.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei share index rose 2.3% on Monday to a one-month high.\nKishida said his administration would attempt to compile an extra budget this year that would support for people hit by the pandemic, including those who lost their jobs and students struggling to pay tuition fees. \u201cThe lower house election is about choosing a leadership,\u201d Kishida told public broadcaster NHK. \u201cWith the ruling coalition certain to keep its majority, I believe we received a mandate from the voters.\u201d The Constitutional Democratic party of Japan, the biggest opposition group, lost more than a dozen seats. But the rightwing populist Japan Innovation party, whose base is in the western city of Osaka, quadrupled its presence to 41 seats to become the third-biggest party in the chamber. Some exit polls had predicted an uncomfortably close night for Kishida and the LDP, which has governed Japan almost without interruption since the mid-1950s and last lost a lower house election in 2009.\nKishida, who became prime minister last month after his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, decided not to run in the LDP leadership race, said he would prepare Japan\u2019s health service for a possible wave of winter Covid-19 cases and tackle income inequality as he attempts to revive the pandemic-hit economy with a multi-trillion yen stimulus package. \u201cThe overall trend is in favour of stability. The LDP cleared the hurdles it absolutely had to,\u201d said Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a lot of stimulus.\u201d Kishida, 64, had hoped that his focus on a vaguely defined \u201cnew capitalism\u201d that would redistribute wealth to Japan\u2019s struggling middle classes would help his party retain its healthy majority in parliament. He had also promised a more responsive leadership amid criticism that Shinzo Abe, who stepped down last year, and his short-lived successor, Suga, had lost touch with voters, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Voter apathy was reflected in the turnout, which at just under 56% was the third lowest since the end of the war.\nUnusually for an incoming leader, Kishida did not enjoy a political honeymoon, with approval ratings about 50%, the lowest in two decades for a new administration in Japan. Several opposition parties had attempted to capitalise on unusually close cooperation, with five of them, including the communists, agreeing before the campaign not to compete against each other in marginal constituencies in an attempt to consolidate the anti-LDP vote. They called for more help for low-income families, as well as to allow married couples to use separate surnames and for the legalisation of same-sex marriage \u2013 two changes Kishida has said he opposes. \u201cI focused on the candidates\u2019 policies on same-sex marriage and LGBT issues. I have many friends in gay or lesbian couples. I hope public understanding on these issues will deepen,\u201d said Eko Nagasaki, an 18-year-old woman who voted for the first time. Several polls had indicated that Kishida, a softly spoke centrist whose rise had been met with indifference by many voters, lacked the profile to lead the LDP to a convincing victory. Last month he defeated three rivals to become party president \u2013 effectively securing him the premiership \u2013 including Taro Kono, a reformist whose popularity among voters was not shared by many party MPs. Kishida, who had delayed a decision on his attendance at Cop26 summit until the election results were in, will now come under pressure to offer more details of his plans for the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, as well as ensure that Japan\u2019s medical infrastructure is better able to cope with a possible rise in Covid-19 cases. On the foreign policy front, he backs party plans to dramatically raise defence spending in response to an increasingly uncertain security environment in north-east Asia. The LDP included in its election platform a pledge to double defence spending to 2% of GDP, citing rising tensions between China and Taiwan and North Korea\u2019s resumption of ballistic missile tests. Japan, whose postwar \u201cpacifist\u201d constitution forbids it from using force to settle international disputes, has traditionally kept spending on defence to within 1% of GDP. Any attempt to break through that symbolic barrier could encounter resistance at home and spark protests from China. Yoshihiko Suzuki, who voted for opposition candidates, said he hoped Kishida\u2019s win would bring an end to the \u201carrogance and complacency\u201d that had characterised his predecessors\u2019 administrations. \u201cI hope this election comes as a wakeup call for them,\u201d the retired 68-year-old said. \u201cIf it does, the LDP will become a better party, considering the number of talented lawmakers they\u2019ve got.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/ruling-party-of-fumio-kishida-wins-smaller-majority-in-japanese-election", "last_update": "2021-11-01T14:27:02Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Australia has been dragged kicking and screaming to a net zero plan before Glasgow, but we still trail the pack | Michael Mann and Christopher Wright", "article": "After much Sturm und Drang, Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has finally jetted off to attend the global climate talks in Glasgow with a vague and hastily assembled commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The growing international pressure and voter concerns over the devastating climate impacts Australia has endured in recent years appear to have finally dragged the government kicking and screaming to this position, despite a rearguard action by the government\u2019s Coalition partners, the National party, against any such commitment. However, last week Morrison triumphantly waved a pamphlet proclaiming his government\u2019s commitment to net zero under the banner of the \u201cAustralian Way\u201d.\nLong on promises and short on details, the government\u2019s commitment relies upon the viability of dubious future technologies, most notably carbon capture at massive scale, rather than any mandated reduction in emissions, let alone a price or tax on emitted carbon. As Morrison said: \u201cOur plan works with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it doesn\u2019t legislate them, it doesn\u2019t mandate them.\u201d While business groups, including those representing the country\u2019s coal industry like the Minerals Council of Australia, praised the announcement as providing certainty, overseas observers have noted this commitment is the weakest among developed nations attending the Glasgow talks, and lacks any change to the government\u2019s existing emissions reductions targets of 26% to 28% by 2030 (half what other industrialised nations such as the US, the UK and the European Union have committed to). Indeed, recent analysis suggests Australia is at the back of the pack among developed nations in terms of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels. While this commitment, even if reluctant, to net zero emissions by 2050 is to be welcomed, in reality it needs to be seen within the broader context of the Australian government\u2019s continued coddling of the fossil fuel industry. Australia is among the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel exporters (ranking just behind Russia and Saudi Arabia) and the largest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, making up 7% of global fossil fuel exports. After decades of government-sponsored expansion, Australia\u2019s coal and gas industries make the country the fifth-largest miner of fossil fuel carbon in absolute terms (larger than India, Indonesia, Canada, Iraq and Iran). Added to that, domestic emissions are significant, ranking 14th globally, and on a per capita basis the highest in the OECD.\nThis fossil fuel addiction stems from the close support by government of the industry over decades, with considerable assistance from the Murdoch media empire, who have presented fossil fuel extraction and use as inherent to Australia\u2019s national identity and economic wellbeing. While growing concerns over climate change have prompted attempts at policy reform (most notably the former Gillard Labor government\u2019s introduction of carbon pricing legislation a decade ago), these moves have been strenuously opposed by the Coalition and the mining industry.\nHowever, as outright denial of climate change becomes untenable in the face of record-breaking droughts, fires, and floods, industry and its abettors in government and the conservative media have engaged in what one of us has termed the new climate war. This war on climate action involves an array of tactics that fall short of outright denial, but are nonetheless aimed at blocking, or at least slowing, the transition of fossil fuels. In Australia, a chief tactic of the forces of climate inaction has been to call for a \u201cmeasured response\u201d which in no way constrains fossil fuel expansion. If Australia were to limit its coal exports, the inactivists argue, buyers would source coal from elsewhere (a variation of the \u201cdrug-dealer\u2019s defence\u201d). Or they assert that Australian coal helps bring developing nations out of \u201cenergy poverty\u201d (a tagline developed by US coal giant Peabody Energy and promoted by climate inactivists). Coal is \u201cgood for humanity\u201d they insist. Indeed, Morrison in a previous incarnation as the country\u2019s treasurer in the hot summer of 2017 famously waved a lump of coal at opposition politicians on the floor of parliament, declaring: \u201cThis is coal \u2026 don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d Well, we should have been afraid. Very afraid. After all, look who is now prime minister.\nGiven the Coalition\u2019s history of defending the dominance of fossil energy in Australia, what are we to make of their belated acceptance of the net zero agenda? Overall, it appears the song remains the same! The failure to commit to increased emissions reduction targets, as well as the recent disclosures that the Australian government has sought to water down a UN recommendation to phase out coal- and gas-fired power stations, and rejected a call to join a US and European-led pledge to cut methane emissions, and that the country\u2019s energy minister will be spruiking the benefits of Australian gas investment at the Glasgow talks, all seem par for the course. While Morrison has swapped the lump of coal for a flashy pamphlet, there appears little substance to the government\u2019s purported commitment to climate action. Like other nations and companies committed to a continuation of business-as-usual fossil fuel extraction and use, it appears the name of the game is delay and inaction. Unfortunately, the time for delay is well past and the window to avoid catastrophic climate disruption is rapidly closing. We can\u2019t afford further inaction and obfuscation by the current Australian government. \u2022 Michael E Mann is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.

{"title": "Macron took aim at Scott Morrison over the submarine fracas \u2013 and he did not miss | Katharine Murphy", "article": "It wasn\u2019t clear that Emmanuel Macron would stop when encircled by a small party of Australian journalists after he had finished his press conference at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Rome. His minders clearly wanted their waylaid boss to keep on walking. But the French president chose to stop and entertain questions. Having been invited politely to reflect on the nuclear submarine fracas, Macron took aim at Scott Morrison, and he did not miss.\nMorrison has been shadowed by the Aukus controversy ever since his departure from Australia last Thursday. Macron\u2019s opening submarine sortie came in a phone call just before the prime minister boarded his plane for the G20. Diplomatic relations between Canberra and Paris have been in the deep freeze since Morrison dumped the $90bn contract with the French Naval Group, and whipped Aukus out of his back pocket. Facing the prospect of having to front two international summits with Macron, where any obvious snub would grab headlines, Morrison attempted to repair the relationship by reaching out to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Macron consented to a phone call. During the call last Thursday, Macron told Morrison that ditching the submarine contract had broken \u201cthe relationship of trust\u201d. Canberra needed to propose \u201ctangible actions\u201d to heal the rift. Macron also hoped Morrison had packed lashings of ambition before arriving at the G20 and the Cop26 in Glasgow. Australia, he said, needed \u201cto cease production and consumption of coal at the national level and abroad\u201d. We know all this because Macron got his official record of the conversation out first. In the time-honoured diplomatic game of duelling readouts, first movers always establish the terms of any ensuing narrative.\nMacron\u2019s version was splashed prominently across Australian news outlets while Morrison was winging his way slowly north. Journalists travelling on the plane with Morrison were not given a heads-up. We found out when the news of the call broke. The tenor of the call established that any rapprochement between Paris and Canberra would be gritted teeth at best. By the time Morrison touched down in Rome, the \u201coptics\u201d got worse. On the evening before the G20, Joe Biden (another one of the Aukus traitors) embarked on his own performative rapprochement with Macron. During a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate at France\u2019s Vatican embassy in Rome, Biden acknowledged the handling of the submarine fracas had been \u201cclumsy\u201d. Biden wasn\u2019t done. He told his French counterpart he\u2019d been \u201cunder the impression\u201d that France had been informed long before Aukus (surprise!) day that the contract was going to be terminated. It was possible Biden was rebuking his own senior staff. Morrison insists the Biden administration was kept informed of all the twists and turns in Australia\u2019s long conversation with France about the troubled Naval Group contract while the secret Aukus planning was under way. The Canberra version of this story is senior White House aides failed to manage up. But it was also possible Biden had just landed a very public blow on Morrison. With Angela Merkel, the political titan of Europe, bowing out of public life, Macron is very important to Biden. If Macron wanted a scalp to restore dented French national pride perhaps it better be that \u201cfellow from down under\u201d. Thank you very much pal. Being berated in Rome wasn\u2019t on Morrison\u2019s G20 plan. The plan was to raise the alarm about people being nasty on Facebook, and block any inconvenient language presaging a phase-out of coal in the final communique. But instead of Roman Holiday, Morrison found himself on the receiving end of a Malachi Crunch from Biden and Macron. Things got even worse on Sunday night when Macron accused Morrison of lying during his impromptu chat with Australian journalists \u2013 an extraordinary charge in diplomatic terms. The obvious question to ask \u2013 is Macron\u2019s lying charge fair? Morrison was ropable when he learned of the accusation. He says he didn\u2019t lie. Morrison says he gave Macron a significant hint in June that the contract was in strife. The prime minister says he wasn\u2019t in a position to be any more candid because the Aukus pact needed to be secret squirrel right up until the time Biden, Boris Johnson and Morrison decided to fess up. This rings true. There aren\u2019t many countries in the world that would dare pre-empt an American national security announcement if the US expressly forbade its disclosure. Morrison was in a difficult position. But it\u2019s fair to say Morrison put himself in a difficult position by choosing to pursue US nuclear-powered submarines while still contracted to a French alternative. Aukus wasn\u2019t foisted on him. He wasn\u2019t a victim. This was an opportunity Morrison hunted down for Australia. Another question to ask, apart from what on earth Morrison can do to make things right, is how this fracas reads domestically. Morrison is very obviously trying to insulate himself from reputational damage by declaring he has prioritised Australia\u2019s national security ahead of French national pride. If France must be humiliated in the process of keeping Australians safe \u2013 then bring on the humiliation. Who is that uppity Macron to poke an Australian prime minister in the chest? Nationalist parables like this one write themselves. Morrison clearly believes he has a viable means of discounting Macron\u2019s very undiplomatic attack on his character and integrity, and perhaps that will work. But the risk for Morrison is Macron\u2019s precision demolition plays right into pre-existing voter unease that Australia\u2019s prime minister doesn\u2019t always play it straight, and very rarely cops it sweet.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/macron-took-aim-at-scott-morrison-over-the-submarine-fracas-and-he-did-not-miss", "last_update": "2021-11-01T02:17:38Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Many of the passengers who were onboard the first flights from Singapore and Los Angeles walked into the arrivals terminal shortly after 6am on Monday morning to be greeted by emotional family members and loved ones.\nReturning Australians were handed Tim Tams and hakea pincushion flowers as they made their way through a crowd of reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to my daughter, I\u2019ve got to hold her,\u201d one woman said as she pushed through the throng to embrace her daughter. Carlie Boyd was one of the first Australians to push a trolley of suitcases into the arrivals hall \u2013 clearing the heavily sterilised customs area at 6.28am and breathing in the crisp Sydney morning air for the first time in more than three years. Boyd\u2019s brother Ryan Boyd and sister Clare Lyons had arrived at the airport before 6am with a balloon and sign to welcome her, and raced to hug her. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty stressful, so just to be able to come home without having to go quarantine is huge,\u201d Boyd said.\nShe had been living in New York, and after being unable to secure a flight home during the months of quarantine arrival caps, bought her Qantas ticket to Sydney three days ago. She and her siblings planned to surprise their parents at their Blue Mountains family home. \u201cThere were a lot of people on that flight who have loved ones who are about to die or had people who died this week, so for them to be able to get off the plane and go and see them straight away is pretty amazing,\u201d Boyd said.\nOther passengers Guardian Australia spoke to said there were only about 70 people on the first Qantas flight, and that many were visiting dying loved ones. When Ethan Carter walked into the arrivals hall and on to Australian soil for the first time in two years, he had only one thing on his mind. His mother, Joy. \u201cI\u2019m anxious and excited and can\u2019t wait to see her.\u201d\nCarter, who lives in Chicago, said he was desperate to see his mother, who has fallen ill and been moved into permanent care. \u201cShe\u2019s in WA, so I don\u2019t want to talk about their laws \u2026 I might not ever be let in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really scared and emotional because I really want to see my mum.\u201d He choked up as he added: \u201cThe doctor said that she hasn\u2019t got long.\u201d He then approached border officials to discuss how he could fly to Perth to quarantine before visiting his mother. He also issued a plea to the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan: \u201cMark, think of the people that are suffering mentally to see their family, that\u2019s also a health issue \u2026 You\u2019ve got to bring families together again, you have to \u2013 everybody needs to be together, it\u2019s so important. \u201cWe respect that you\u2019re trying to be safe, but everyone needs to be together, please.\u201d Elsewhere in the arrivals halls, some were meeting new family members for the first time. Moments after her son Robert walked out of the customs hall with his partner, Ivan, and daughter, Pia, Deb d\u2019Apice picked up her two-year-old granddaughter, held her up to her face, and stared into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous, I just feel fabulous,\u201d she said.\nUpstairs at the departure gates, travel-hungry Australians were gathering to make the most of the international travel freedoms that also came into effect on Monday. After hearing that international trips would be allowed without an exemption \u2013 and knowing tht she would not have to quarantine on her return \u2013 Nicole Forrest booked tickets with United Airlines to travel to Mexico with her daughter, 12-year-old Olive. They will fly through Los Angeles before travelling to Tulum, where the pair from Cronulla are planning to enjoy beaches and visit local sites. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking exciting,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a spiritual experience.\u201d Olive said she was most excited to sample the food in Mexico.\nMiad and Zahra Zandabi were flying to Boston, where they are moving to for a job that Miad organised more than a year ago but for which they had been unable to secure exit approvals. \u201cTo be honest, we\u2019re sad to be leaving Australia, but after the lockdown it\u2019s very exciting to start anew,\u201d Miad said. The Pagewood couple have family overseas, and hope to be able to visit them more easily. Melanie Carrier posed for a photo at the Sydney departures sign before farewelling her partner, Richard Peake, and walking to her flight\u2019s departure gate. She is travelling to visit family in Montreal who she hasn\u2019t seen for more than two years. \u201cI just want to be able to go home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed weddings and birthdays, and I want to hug my parents again.\u201d\nThe experience of dropping someone off at departures felt strange to Peake, who noted that there was none of the typical congestion and parking shortages of pre-pandemic days. While airline officials reported queues in the international terminal being the longest they\u2019d been all year, the airport is far from its full capacity. On Monday there will be 16 international flight arrivals and 14 departures, up from the average of 10 arrivals and departures each day since July last year. But while most arriving flights have been limited to 10 passengers, flights on Monday had no limits on how many vaccinated passengers they could carry.

{"title": "Covid booster jabs offered at NHS walk-in clinics in England ", "article": "Covid booster jabs are now being given at walk-in clinics in England as the NHS aims to increase vaccine uptake before what is expected to be a challenging winter. From Monday, anyone in an eligible group who had their second dose of a coronavirus vaccine at least six months ago can turn up at one of hundreds of sites to get their top-up without making an appointment. The walk-in centres are also offering vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds. The move follows criticism of the booster campaign, with only about half of the 12 million people in England eligible so far for a third vaccine dose having received one. The vaccine rollout to teenagers has lagged behind that of countries including France, Italy and Spain. People entitled to a booster jab are: those aged 50 and over, people who live and work in care homes; frontline health and social care workers; people aged 16 and over with a health condition that puts them at high risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19; those aged 16 and over who are a main carer for someone at high risk from the virus, and; people aged 16 and over who live with someone who is more likely to get infections. Nikki Kanani, a GP and the deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: \u201cNHS staff are making it as easy as possible for people to get their top-up vaccination, and from today people can now go online, find their nearest site and go and get their booster without delay. \u201cThe booster is not just nice to have. It is really important protection ahead of what we know will be a challenging winter.\u201d People are advised to use the NHS online walk-in finder to check where their nearest centre is and whether it is offering boosters, and vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds. NHS England said almost everyone registered with a GP practice lives within 10 miles of a fixed vaccination site. On Friday clinical guidelines were amended to allow care home residents and some vulnerable people to get their Covid booster vaccine a month early, in an effort to boost immunity during the winter. The booster campaign is a central part of the government\u2019s strategy for limiting hospital admissions because immunity from the initial two doses wanes over time, particularly in older adults and at-risk groups. Protection against symptomatic illness falls from 65% up to three months after the second dose to 45% six months after the second dose for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and from 90% to 65% for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to the latest evidence from the government\u2019s scientific advisers. Protection against hospitalisation is estimated to fall from 95% to 75% for Oxford/AstraZeneca and from 99% to 90% for Pfizer/BioNTech. On Sunday a further 38,009 people were reported as testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK in the previous 24 hours, with the seven-day total down 14% on the previous week, and 74 deaths were reported, with the seven-day total up 16%. A total of 45,697,856 second vaccine doses had been administered as of 30 October, while a combined total of 7,925,851 booster and third doses had been delivered, a day-on-day rise of 361,428.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/01/nhs-walk-in-clinics-england-now-offer-covid-booster-vaccinations", "last_update": "2021-11-01T11:57:45Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Netflix\u2019s Emily in Paris to focus on diversity, says star Lily Collins ", "article": "It has been criticised for trotting out cliches about France and the French and mocked for its idealised portrayal of Paris. But now the Netflix show Emily in Paris will focus on diversity and inclusion for its second series, according to its star, Lily Collins. The actor, who stars as Emily and is also a producer on the series, said she had heard viewers\u2019 concerns about the show, which first hit our screens last year, and efforts had been made to address them.\nIn an interview with Elle UK, for its December issue, Collins said: \u201cFor me as Emily, but also as a producer on [the show], after season one, hearing people\u2019s thoughts, concerns, questions, likes, dislikes, just feelings about it, there were certain things that spoke to the time that we\u2019re living in and what is right, and moral and correct and should be done. \u201cAnd I really wanted diversity and inclusion in front of and behind the camera to be something that we really put our focus on, in a lot of ways. Hiring new people in front of the camera, also giving new storylines to different characters, which was really important.\u201d Created by Darren Star, who is best known for Sex and the City, Emily in Paris tells the story of Emily Cooper, played by Collins, an ambitious American marketing executive who lands her dream job in the French capital. And while the series has been a hit for Netflix, it did not find favour among the French when it premiered in October last year. The French news outlet 20 Minutes opined: \u201cThe berets. The croissants. The baguettes. The hostile waiters. The irascible concierges. The inveterate philanderers. The lovers and the mistresses. Name a cliche about France and the French, you\u2019ll find it in Emily in Paris.\u201d Charles Martin, critic for Premi\u00e8re, was equally irritated. \u201cFrankly, watching Emily in Paris there\u2019s plenty to feel insulted about,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen they decided to caricature us, the authors didn\u2019t hold back.\u201d RTL radio added that in between \u201cthe berets, the cocktail dresses and the invariably spotless streets, Parisians will not find it easy to recognise their daily lives\u201d. Filming for the second series, which took place during the pandemic, meant the French capital was \u201cvery empty\u201d, said Collins, who is the daughter of singer-songwriter Phil Collins. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any Americans around because they weren\u2019t allowed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that felt even more strange, because the only accents you would hear were French \u2013 which was also really lovely.\u201d Discussing her father, Collins, 32, added: \u201cStarting out, when I was younger, I had lots of things taken out of context in interviews. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be a more proud daughter, a more loving daughter. I love him and I am in awe and I respect him and I\u2019m inspired by him. \u201cBut as an individual, I\u2019ve always wanted to be me, and to have my own path and my own journey and my own failures and successes and all those things, like any individual wants.\u201d The second series of Emily in Paris is scheduled for release in December.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/01/emily-in-paris-netflix-series-two-diversity-lily-collins", "last_update": "2021-10-31T15:35:26Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Ministers\u2019 conduct needs to be properly policed, review says ", "article": "The prime minister should no longer be the only person who can give permission for ethics investigations into his own conduct and that of ministers, according to a wide-ranging review by the independent committee on standards in public life. The committee, chaired by former spy chief Jonathan Evans, found that the rules around the conduct of ministers need strengthening, arguing they currently fall \u201cbelow the bar\u201d for effective standards regulation. In its \u201clandscape review\u201d of standards in public life, it made nine recommendations, including major changes to the ministerial code of conduct, which is overseen by the prime minister. It follows widespread calls for reform of the system after Boris Johnson\u2019s previous adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, Sir Alex Allan, resigned after a report into the conduct of Priti Patel, the home secretary, was ignored.\nFollowing an investigation into allegations that Patel engaged in bullying behaviour, Allan found she had \u201cnot consistently met the high standards expected of her\u201d, but a government statement said the PM had full confidence in her and considered the matter \u201cclosed\u201d. Since then, Johnson has appointed a new adviser, Christopher Geidt, a former senior aide to the Queen, whose first task was investigating the controversial Downing Street refurbishment that involved Johnson borrowing money from a Tory donor via the Conservative party. Lord Geidt concluded that Johnson had acted in an \u201cunwise\u201d manner without having breached the rules. At the moment, the PM is the only person with the power to order investigations into the conduct of ministers, including himself, and is the one to appoint the independent adviser who carries out investigations. However, the committee on standards in public life said the independent adviser on ministerial interests should instead be appointed by a panel made up predominantly of independent members. It also recommended that the adviser should be able to initiate their own investigations, have the authority to determine breaches of the code and see their report published within eight weeks of submission to the PM. On the ministerial code itself, the report said it needed to have a constitutional footing laid down in law, with any revisions subject to advice from the independent adviser, and possible sanctions for breaches should be set out including apologies, fines and asking for a minister\u2019s resignation. The committee also recommended a strengthening of the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which governs the revolving door between government and the private sector by advising on lobbying and jobs taken on by former ministers and officials. It said the current ban on officials and ministers lobbying for two years after leaving their post should be able to be extended to up to five years, and any work for a lobbying firm should be included in the ban, rather than just a prohibition on direct lobbying. \u201cThe lack of any meaningful sanctions for a breach of the rules is no longer sustainable,\u201d the report said, suggesting injunctions against lobbying work could be sought or means of recouping severance or pension payments. Thirdly, it said there needed to be further reforms to the powers of the commissioner for public appointments, which oversees jobs for top civil servants and at public bodies, to make sure appointment panels are independent. Evans, a former director general of MI5, said the committee had concluded that the \u201ccurrent system of standards regulation is overly dependent on convention\u201d. The recommendations were necessary to \u201crestore public confidence in the regulation of ethical standards in government\u201d, he added. In response, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union for senior civil servants, said the recommendation that the independent adviser should be able to initiate investigations was \u201cessential if the code is to have a meaningful independent function\u201d. \u201cThere can be no hiding from the fact that the current prime minister has undermined confidence in the ministerial code as a meaningful regulator of ministerial conduct,\u201d Penman said. The recommendations were endorsed by Sir John Major, the former Tory prime minister who first set up the committee. In a foreword, Major said the committee \u201cmakes many important recommendations that I hope will be approved by the government \u2013 and, where necessary, parliament \u2013 and then implemented\u201d. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said her party welcomed the report, and many of its recommendations had previously been called for by Labour. \u201cBoris Johnson and his Conservative colleagues\u2019 actions have repeatedly undermined standards in our public life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system that is supposed to uphold the ministerial code, lobbying rules, business appointments, public appointments and transparency is clearly unfit for purpose. \u201cMinisters have disregarded the rules and it is about time for a radical overhaul of the system.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/ministers-conduct-needs-to-be-properly-policed-review-says", "last_update": "2021-10-31T19:03:09Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "EU riding roughshod over Northern Ireland trade, says Brexit minister", "article": "Relations between the EU and the UK risk further deterioration after the Brexit minister accused Brussels of behaving \u201cwithout regard to the huge political, economic and identity sensitivities\u201d in Northern Ireland. David Frost said the bloc had \u201cdestroyed cross-community consent\u201d with an \u201coverly strict\u201d enforcement of the arrangements hammered out in the withdrawal agreement of January 2020.\nHis comments, in a foreword to a new paper for the Policy Exchange thinktank, were published days after a second week of talks between both sides ended in deadlock. He also articulated, in the plainest terms yet, a view held in Downing Street that the protocol\u2019s terms were foisted upon Britain owing to the weakness of Theresa May in the first phase of negotiations in 2017. Lord Frost said the EU-UK joint report, which set the terms for the article 50 process of divorce from the EU, was a result of the UK failing to make \u201cthe necessary mental shift from being a member of the EU to negotiating exit from the EU\u201d. The joint report was a landmark moment in the history of Brexit, marked by the humiliation of May by Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party in December 2017 just as she was about to co-sign it with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The then-DUP leader Arlene Foster, who was propping up May\u2019s government, told her she would not support clauses which meant Northern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the republic if the border problem could not be solved in second phase of negotiations. Days later the section of the joint report was changed to accommodate the DUP but the sequencing of Brexit was set in stone, putting the Irish border solutions into the legally binding withdrawal agreement \u2013 Dublin\u2019s point of maximum leverage \u2013 rather than future trade relations. The faultlines generated by the sequencing appear to be driving Frost\u2019s demands for fundamental changes to the protocol. He says he considered resigning from his role as foreign affairs special adviser to Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, after reading the terms of the joint report and realising \u201ca crucial pass had been sold\u201d. Frost said the protocol agreed that December was a result of the \u201cextreme weakness\u201d of the UK government after the June 2017 election. \u201cWe must return to the protocol and deliver a more robust, and more balanced, outcome than we could in 2019.\u201d The Policy Exchange paper \u2013 The Northern Ireland Protocol: the origins of the current crisis, by Roderick Crawford \u2013 provides a chronology of Brexit negotiations and what went wrong in 2017. It argues that commitments, particularly on the Irish border, in the joint report were \u201ca diplomatic triumph for Ireland and the Commission\u201d but that \u201cfailing to secure adequate reciprocal concessions was a staggering failure for the UK\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/01/eu-riding-roughshod-over-northern-ireland-trade-says-brexit-minister", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:02:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},

But one company believes it may have solved both problems in one fell swoop with its \u201cChristmas dinner in a can\u201d. The days peeling potatoes, prepping sprouts and basting turkey could be numbered if this new festive offering catches on. The dinner, or more accurately soup, from Heinz, contains \u201cbig chunks\u201d of turkey, pigs in blankets, brussels sprouts, stuffing balls and potatoes, with a gravy and cranberry sauce. Heinz will produce only 500 cans of its Christmas Dinner Big Soup this year, but has hinted it could roll out greater numbers next year if it proves a hit with shoppers. The cans, which cost \u00a31.50 plus post and packaging, are available online from Monday. Anke von Hanstein, the brand manager for Heinz Soups, said: \u201cIt is made for those with a big love for hearty festive flavours and tastes just perfect with a slice of warm crusty bread. Any soup that includes pigs in blankets and roasties is a winner in our eyes.\u201d A survey of 2,027 UK adults conducted for the brand found that 36% of those who celebrate Christmas prefer the traditional dinner to any other meal. About 42% said they would eat it more often if it did not take so long to cook, and 36% said they would have it more often if it were not so expensive. Research into last year\u2019s festivities by MoneySuperMarket found that nearly a third of those surveyed expected to spend between \u00a330 and \u00a360 a head, while 8% were willing to splash out between \u00a370 and \u00a3100 a head. Experts have said this year\u2019s festive fare could be the most expensive ever with supply chain issues, among other problems, hampering stock control. Michael Caines, the chef-owner at Lympstone Manor in Devon, said of the soup: \u201cAt first I thought this was a joke, the chef in me thinking: \u2018That\u2019s no way to serve a Christmas dinner!\u2019 But then I reflect on the fact that many people out there might not be able to afford a Christmas dinner.

{"title": "\u2018The Great Resignation\u2019: almost one in four UK workers planning job change", "article": "Almost a quarter of workers are actively planning to change employers in the next few months, a report has claimed, as part of a \u201cgreat resignation\u201d prompted by a high number of vacancies and burnout caused by the pandemic. A survey of 6,000 workers by the recruitment firm Randstad UK found that 69% of them were feeling confident about moving to a new role in the next few months, with 24% planning a change within three to six months.\nThe company said it would normally expect up to 11% of workers to move jobs every year. It has warned that such a move will have considerable cost implications for employers \u2013 as much as \u00a325,000 for each worker \u2013 and said it has been advising clients to start looking at whether they needed to improve pay and other conditions to help them retain their best staff. Victoria Short, CEO at Randstad UK, said some of those looking for new jobs were workers who during the pandemic had stayed in roles they were unhappy with. She said: \u201cAnother factor is burnout. Some teams have been running too hot for too long. The pandemic has changed how some people think about life, work, and what they want out of both. It\u2019s made people step back and rethink their lives. Covid has reminded them that life is too short.\u201d The research found that only 16% of workers described themselves as worried about trying to get a new job. Workers currently employed in construction, tech and logistics were all confident they would find new opportunities, with workers in manufacturing being the most confident. Randstad warned the mass resignations will come at considerable cost to the UK\u2019s private sector. Research carried out by Oxford Economics found that it takes recently hired professional workers 28 weeks to reach optimum productivity \u2013 which has an attached cost of \u00a325,200 per employee, it said. Short added: \u201cThe Great Resignation is going to be tricky for those industries that can move workers around. It is going to be very difficult indeed for industries where employees are trying to get out altogether. A shortage of workers in some industries has led companies to offer signing on bonuses of up to \u00a310,000 to attract recruits, although some surveys have suggested many do not plan to increase wages. The latest Lloyds Bank Business Barometer, published on Monday, found that 48% of businesses said it had become easier to hire people with the right skills or experience since the end of the furlough scheme. When asked about wage growth, 43% of firms said they were expecting a 2% increase in average pay over the next 12 months, while 25% anticipated a 3% rise.\nOverall, Lloyds said business confidence in October was at its second highest level since March 2020, and that staff shortages suffered in some sectors may be starting to ease. Hann-Ju Ho, a senior commercial banking economist at Lloyds Bank, said businesses are feeling relatively buoyant and overall business confidence is above the long-term average. \u201cWith 60% of firms saying that they expect to bring all their furloughed staff back to work, and a further 30% intending to bring back more than half, it should bode well for the labour market as we head into the winter.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/nov/01/the-great-resignation-almost-one-in-four-workers-planning-job-change", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:43:27Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Siemian replaced Winston in the second quarter, completed 16 of 29 for 159 yards and drove the Saints (5-2) 70 yards to Brian Johnson\u2019s 23-yard field goal that gave them a 29-27 lead with 1:44 remaining. On the second play of the ensuing possession Williams stepped in front of a Brady pass and ran 40 yards for a touchdown. Brady, who threw a go-ahead 50-yard touchdown pass to Cyril Grayson with 5:44 left, completed 28 of 40 for 375 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions as the Bucs (6-2) saw their lead over New Orleans in the NFC South slip to half a game. Pittsburgh Steelers 15-10 Cleveland Browns Ben Roethlisberger handed Cleveland yet another loss as the Pittsburgh Steelers survived losing kicker Chris Boswell for the entire second half. Roethlisberger threw a touchdown pass and rookie Najee Harris had an eight-yard TD run after halftime for the Steelers (4-3), who were handicapped by Boswell suffering a concussion on a blown trick play. The Browns (4-4) had plenty of chances, but wide receiver Jarvis Landry had a costly fumble and then couldn\u2019t handle two passes from Baker Mayfield in the final six minutes.\nThe injury to Boswell, who got hurt when he was drilled by Browns tackle Jordan Elliott after throwing an incomplete pass, influenced Steelers coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s play-calling throughout the second half. Punter Pressley Harvin III is Pittsburgh\u2019s backup kicker, but he was having enough trouble with kickoffs and never even attempted to kick the ball into the sideline net. New England Patriots 27-24 Los Angeles Chargers Adrian Phillips intercepted two passes, returning one for the go-ahead touchdown against his former team, Nick Folk kicked four field goals, and the New England Patriots rallied for a 27-24 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. It was the first multi-interception game for Phillips, who played six seasons for the Chargers (2014-19) before signing with the Patriots last year. With 10:20 remaining in the fourth quarter, he picked off a pass intended for Jared Cook, who was not on the same page as Justin Herbert, and returned it 26 yards to put the Patriots back in front. Rookie Mac Jones then connected with Jakobi Meyers on the two-point conversion to give New England a seven-point advantage. Los Angeles Rams 38\u201322 Houston Texans Matthew Stafford threw for 305 yards and three touchdowns in three quarters, and the Los Angeles Rams dominated the inept Houston Texans in every way. It was the fourth straight victory for the Rams (7-1) and the seventh loss in a row for the Texans (1-7), their longest skid since dropping the final 14 games of the 2013 season. Cincinnati Bengals 31-34 New York Jets Shaq Lawson gave the Jets their first interception of the season and Mike White outdueled Joe Burrow as New York rallied late to pull an upset over the visiting Cincinnati Bengals. Lawson deflected a screen pass and caught the carom for the interception with 4:32 to go. Two plays later, White hit Tyler Kroft with a 13-yard, go-head touchdown. White caught the two-point conversion pass from Jamison Crowder on a trick play and the Jets led 34-31 with 3:50 left. Cincinnati (5-3) punted from their own 40 with 2:19 remaining and never got the ball back after a third-down personal foul penalty extended the Jets\u2019 last possession. The Jets (2-5) snapped a two-game skid and won for the first time in the last four meetings against Cincinnati. Tennessee Titans 34\u201331 Indianapolis Colts Randy Bullock made a 45-yard field goal with 4:03 left in overtime to cap a wild game, giving the Tennessee Titans a 34-31 victory and control of the AFC South. The teams combined for two touchdowns in the final 86 seconds of regulation to set up overtime and Colts quarterback Carson Wentz threw two interceptions in the final eight minutes after throwing only one all season. Tennessee (6-2) have won four straight overall to take a three-game lead in the division and also have the third season sweep of the Colts in franchise history. Indianapolis (3-5) have lost three straight in the series this one coming in improbable fashion. After the Colts forced a punt with less than two minutes left in regulation and taking over on their eight-yard line, Wentz was in danger of being sacked for a safety. He made an ill-advised, left-handed forward flick that rookie Elijah Molden snatched out of the air and scored on a two-yard return to break a 24-24 tie. It was Tennessee\u2019s first interception return for a score in 38 games. Jacksonville Jaguars 7\u201331 Seattle Seahawks Geno Smith ran for one score and threw a pair of touchdown passes to DK Metcalf, and the Seattle Seahawks snapped their three-game losing skid by thumping the Jacksonville Jaguars. In what may be his final start while Russell Wilson recovers from finger surgery, Smith was terrific picking apart the Jaguars defense for one of the best performances of his career. Smith completed his first 14 passes the longest streak to start a game in the NFL this season. He finished 20 of 24 for 195 yards, and his 83.3% completion percentage was a career best with at least 20 pass attempts. Miami Dolphins 11\u201326 Buffalo Bills Josh Allen tossed a go-ahead touchdown pass to Gabriel Davis to lift the host Buffalo Bills over the Miami Dolphins. Davis\u2019 score was the first touchdown of the game for Buffalo (5-2). Allen added a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs, and the Bills\u2019 ferocious defense held on for the win. Miami (1-7) lost their seventh straight game overall and seventh consecutive contest in the series against Buffalo. San Francisco 49ers 33\u201322 Chicago Bears Jimmy Garoppolo passed for 322 yards and ran for two touchdowns and Elijah Mitchell rushed for a career-best 137 yards and a score to help the visiting San Francisco 49ers defeat the Chicago Bears to snap a four-game losing streak. San Francisco (3-4) used an 18-point fourth quarter to surge ahead of Chicago (3-5), who have lost three straight. The 49ers scored on seven successive possessions before a series of kneel-downs to close the game. Philadelphia Eagles 44\u20136 Detroit Lions Boston Scott and Jordan Howard each had two touchdowns on the ground, helping the Philadelphia Eagles run over the Detroit Lions. The Eagles (3-5) ended a two-game losing streak against a team that was very accommodating. The Lions (0-8) go into their bye week as the NFL\u2019s only winless team. The break gives first-year coach Dan Campbell extra time to figure out how to avoid leading the league\u2019s first 0-17 team after being a tight end on the first 0-16 team in Detroit 13 years ago. Washington 10\u201317 Denver Broncos Justin Simmons and Denver\u2019s defense held firm after a fumble gave Washington the ball back, and the Broncos blocked two field goals on their way to a 17-10 win that stopped a four-game slide. Melvin Gordon III caught a touchdown pass and ran for the go-ahead score from 7 yards out with 4:31 remaining. He also fumbled with 21 seconds to go, giving Washington the ball at the Denver 24-yard line. The defense forced Taylor Heinicke to throw the ball out of the back of the end zone on the last play of the game. Carolina Panthers 13-19 Atlanta Falcons Zane Gonzalez kicked four field goals and Chuba Hubbard scored on a six-yard run to seal Carolina\u2019s 19-13 win over the Atlanta Falcons, snapping a four-game skid for the Panthers. Carolina\u2019s defense stuffed Matt Ryan and the Falcons, who managed just 213 yards total offense. Ryan had one of the worst games of his career, throwing for just 146 yards with two interceptions.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/31/no-kicker-no-problem-steelers-beat-browns-despite-injury-to-boswell", "last_update": "2021-11-01T00:00:12Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "US would only quit Iran nuclear deal if Tehran were to renege, Biden pledges", "article": "Joe Biden has given a pledge that if the US returns to the Iran nuclear agreement, it will only subsequently leave if Tehran clearly breaks the terms of the deal. The US president made the commitment, which addresses one of Iran\u2019s key negotiating demands, in a joint statement issued with Germany, France and the UK. The statement followed a meeting on the margins of the G20 in Rome attended by Biden, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson. The key paragraph of a lengthy statement read: \u201cWe welcome President Biden\u2019s clearly demonstrated commitment to return the US to full compliance with the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action] and to stay in full compliance, so long as Iran does the same.\u201d The pledge was welcomed by Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian ambassador to multilateral bodies in Vienna, where talks on the future of the Iran nuclear deal have been on pause since June. Throughout the talks Iran has been seeking an undertaking, ideally legally underpinned, that if Iran returns to the deal, future US administrations will not repeat the walkout of the previous president, Donald Trump, which was accompanied by the imposition of tighter economic sanctions on Iran\u2019s financial institutions and political bodies. Biden is hamstrung in the value of the guarantees he can give to Iran because the nuclear deal is not a signed treaty endorsed by the US Senate, and he cannot bind the hands of future US administrations. However, the Biden pledge, underwritten by the main three European powers, may be a sign that the US wants to create a more positive atmosphere before the resumption of the Vienna talks that Iran has \u2013 after much pressure and delay \u2013 promised will happen at some point in November. There have already been six rounds of talks, but they broke off in June to allow the new Iranian government, led by the president, Ebrahim Raisi, to review its negotiating strategy. During a speech to the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday, Biden said the US will respond to Iranian attacks on US interests in countries such as Syria, but implied that America preferred using economic leverage rather than military force if Iran refused to return to the negotiating table in Vienna to discuss the future of the 2015 nuclear deal. He added the US was still paying the price of bad choices made by the Trump administration, including the decision to quit the nuclear deal in 2018. But he insisted he and European leaders at the summit had agreed diplomacy was the best way forward in handling Iran over the future of the nuclear deal. He said: \u201cWe came together to reiterate our shared belief that diplomacy is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and discussed how best to encourage Iran to resume serious good faith negotiations\u201d. It is not clear if his remarks means the US would disapprove if Israel launched military strikes against Iran if Israel believed Iran was close to being able to assemble the material needed to make a nuclear weapon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Sunday that the United States was \u201cabsolutely in lock step\u201d with Britain, Germany and France on getting Iran back into a nuclear deal, but added it was unclear if Tehran was willing to rejoin the talks in a \u201cmeaningful way\u201d. \u201cIt really depends on whether Iran is serious about doing that,\u201d Blinken said of rejoining the nuclear talks. \u201cAll of our countries, working by the way with Russia and China, believe strongly that that would be the best path forward,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we do not yet know whether Iran is willing to come back to engage in a meaningful way,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cBut if it isn\u2019t, if it won\u2019t, then we are looking together at all of the options necessary to deal with this problem.\u201d The shift in the US tone comes a week after a cyber-attack disabled Iran\u2019s petrol stations, an attack attributed on Sunday by Brig Gen Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran\u2019s civil defence organisation, to Israel and the US. The west has become increasingly concerned that Iran\u2019s delay is a subterfuge, and that Tehran has been using the pause to strengthen its stockpile of uranium, weaken the UN nuclear inspections process and become more familiar with the use of advanced centrifuges that can produce highly enriched uranium. The US is concerned that Iran\u2019s \u201cbreakout\u201d time for developing a nuclear weapon is reducing and that the value of returning to the deal is fast diminishing. It has been looking at alternative options if it decides that diplomacy will not work. In a bid to entrench a revived deal further, Iran is also seeking pledges from the EU about its response if the US was to walk out of the deal a second time. It wants firm pledges that the EU would put more money into Instex, the trading device that the EU set up to ensure Iran and the EU could evade US sanctions. It also wants the EU to allow China and Russia to join the scheme. Instex has largely been inoperable ever since it was set up by the EU with fanfare more than four years ago. The US E3 joint statement issued in Rome at the margins of the G20 summit also contained no demand that Iran, as part of any agreement, commit to follow-on negotiations about what the west regards as its destabilising behaviour in the region. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said in an interview published at the weekend that there was no need for the negotiation and the simplest solution was for Biden to issue an executive order saying he was returning to the nuclear deal and lifting sanctions. Amir-Abdollahian said his administration was embracing a balanced foreign policy, a phrase implying that Iran is going to deprioritise relations with the west, including the main European powers.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/us-iran-nuclear-deal-tehran-joe-biden-pledge", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:56:28Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Vax\u2019 chosen as word of the year by Oxford English Dictionary firm", "article": "In a year when talk over the virtual garden fence has focused on whether you have been jabbed, jagged or had both doses yet, and whether it was Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Moderna you were injected with, Oxford Languages has chosen vax as its word of the year. After deciding last year that it was impossible to sum up 2020 in one word, the company that produces the Oxford English Dictionary said the shorthand for vaccine had \u201cinjected itself into the bloodstream of the English language\u201d this year during the Covid pandemic. In September usage of the word \u201cvax\u201d was up more than 72 times from its level last year, the firm said. The word, and others related to vaccination, had also been broadened into a wider range of contexts including \u201cfully vaxxed\u201d and \u201cvax cards\u201d. Oxford Languages also tracked the rise and fall of vaccine vocabulary, from the usage of \u201cvaccine distribution\u201d in December 2020 to \u201cvaccine rollout\u201d and \u201cvaccine passport\u201d becoming common parlance by mid-March this year. Jab, which started off in US English, is now seen far more commonly in Britain, according to Oxford Language\u2019s analysis. In Scotland, jag has proven to be a frequently used alternative. Vax has also been used in words to describe those against the jab, such as anti-vax or anti-vaxxers. The company said the trend had been seen in other languages, with the use of \u201cvacina\u201d being heard 10 times more in Portugal than it was a decade ago, and the French \u201cvaccin\u201d now almost exclusively referring to the Covid inoculation, according to the report. Casper Grathwohl, the president of Oxford Languages, said: \u201cWhen reviewing the language evidence, vax stood out as an obvious choice. The word\u2019s dramatic spike in usage caught our attention first. Then we ran the analysis and a story started to emerge, revealing how vax sat at the centre of our preoccupations this year. \u201cThe evidence was everywhere, from dating apps (vax 4 vax) and pent-up frustrations (hot vax summer) to academic calendars (vaxx to school) and bureaucratic operations (vax pass). In monopolising our discourse, it\u2019s clear the language of vaccines is changing how we talk \u2013 and think \u2013 about public health, community and ourselves.\u201d The notion of vaccines have been in the English language since the late 1790s, around the time Edward Jenner found that cowpox could be used as a vaccine against the deadly smallpox virus. The dictionary publisher assessed the frequency in use of the word by looking at news content from around the world. Dr Mercedes Durham, a reader in sociolinguistics at Cardiff University, said the choice of \u201cvax\u201d made sense because of its adaptability. \u201cThe word itself, to me it almost has a meme quality. With a meme you take the picture and add things, words, on to it. In some ways you take \u2018vax\u2019 and add \u2018passport\u2019 or \u2018anti\u2019 or \u2018double\u2019 and because it\u2019s such a short word you can add different things on to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising it\u2019s something related to vaccination because these things try to get a spirit of the times, and people have spent more time thinking about vaccines than they ever have before.\u201d She added that social media were likely to have an impact, meaning words devised by younger generations now had more of a reach. \u201cEveryone within their own family and their own circle comes up with new words, and most of the time they stay within that circle. What social media can do, with something like vaccinations, is if you see someone tweeting about being \u2018double vaxxed\u2019, and then somebody else tweeting about \u2018double vaxxed\u2019, then you pick it up \u2013 and things that may have been in different small groups becomes much more widespread.\u201d The report said: \u201cFor lexicographers, it is rare to observe a single topic impact language so dramatically, and in such a short period of time become a critical part of our everyday communication. As reports of medical breakthroughs and rollouts (or strollouts) of vaccines emerged throughout the year, Oxford Languages\u2019 monitor corpus of English tracked a worldwide surge in vaccine-related vocabulary.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/oct/31/vax-chosen-as-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-english-dictionary-firm", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:55:31Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Best bird a bat: tiny flying mammal wins New Zealand bird of the year competition", "article": "In a huge upset to New Zealand birds, but a win for one of the country\u2019s only native land mammals, a bat has swooped in \u201cby a long way\u201d to take out the annual bird of the year competition. Forest and Bird, which runs the election, threw the bat among the pigeons as a surprise entry this year. The pekapeka-tou-roa, or long tailed bat, is one of two bats in the country and one of the rarest mammals in the world. It is as small as a thumb, and the size of a bumblebee when it is born. The voting closed on Sunday night, which appropriately was Halloween. Forest and Bird\u2019s Lissy Fehnker-Heather announced the win to RNZ\u2019s Morning Report on Monday. The pekapeka-tou-roa flew ahead of the avian flock by 3,000 votes, she said, adding that this year\u2019s competition drew the highest number of total votes in the competition\u2019s 17 year history.\n\u201cWe had about 58,000 votes and they came from all around the world,\u201d she said.\nOn being asked whether the bat\u2019s entry was a stunt, Fehnker-Heather said: \u201cNo, bats are New Zealand\u2019s only native land mammals, and they are classed as nationally critical. They face a lot of the same threats that our native birds do, so this year, we thought we\u2019ll try and get more people aware of that.\u201d Rats, possums, stoats and cats are all a major threat to the species, and responsible for its population declining by roughly 5% a year, she said.\nThe bat may have been helped in the polls by powerful backers: New Zealand\u2019s ministry of environment announced it was endorsing the pekapeka campaign. In second place, was the world\u2019s only the only nocturnal and flightless parrot and last year\u2019s champion, the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d. In third was the t\u012btipounamu, or rifleman, considered by M\u0101ori to be the messenger to the gods. In fourth, was the cheeky Kea, the world\u2019s only alpine parrot, known for destroying cars and being exceptionally clever. In fifth place was the Antipodean Albatross, one of New Zealand\u2019s largest seabirds.\nThe annual competition is no stranger to controversy. In 2019, the arrival of hundreds of votes from Russia sparked claims of election meddling. The votes were ultimately judged legitimate, and a Forest and Bird spokesperson said at the time that interest from Russian ornithologists may be responsible. The year before, Forest and Bird alleged that 300 fraudulent votes were cast in the online ballot by Australians attempting to rig the contest in favour of the shag. Fehnker-Heather demured on whether further threatened flying species such as bees would be included future competitions, saying only that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be Bird of the Year without a scandal\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/best-bird-a-bat-tiny-flying-mammal-wins-new-zealand-bird-of-the-year-competition", "last_update": "2021-11-01T22:35:24Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Showtrial review \u2013 will this schlocky murder drama really grip the nation?", "article": "Another Sunday night, another big drama taking itself very seriously. This time, it\u2019s Showtrial (BBC One), which follows a high-stakes murder case taking place under the spotlight of intense public attention and media scrutiny. Early on, it is called \u201cthe trial that has gripped the nation\u201d, and the idea is to explore whether the truth matters or not: will the verdict be based on what actually happened, or on what the jury makes of the defendant? It is a strong premise, and one that speaks to our image-obsessed, issue-led times. And boy, do these characters have issues to navigate. Showtrial should eventually become a courtroom drama, but the opening episode instead treads familiar cop-show territory. After a student ball in Bristol, second-year English and philosophy student Hannah Ellis (Abra Thompson) is reported missing by her mother. Enter police officers who all have bantering nicknames such as \u201cCueball\u201d (bald) and \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d (er, short hair, surname Cassidy), to crack the case. Thanks to the scene that opens proceedings \u2013 we see who is in the dock in the first few moments \u2013 we already know that Hannah is not about to be found at a friend\u2019s house nursing a hangover. The slow, steady reveal of what we do know, however, is devastating and done with care. The phone call Hannah\u2019s mother makes to the police, insisting that she knows deep down that something is wrong, is surely every viewer\u2019s worst nightmare. This is the show at its most sober and reserved. Hannah\u2019s phone shows that she was in receipt of some nasty texts from Talitha Campbell (C\u00e9line Buckens), the wealthy, plummy daughter of a 90s \u201cIt girl\u201d and an unscrupulous property developer (or, as DI Cassidy \u2013 who has the pleasure of questioning Talitha \u2013 describes her, \u201ca rude, entitled little cow\u201d). Hannah was the first person in her family to go to university, while Talitha was expelled from a fancy private girls\u2019 school and can barely speak to another human being without treating them like a member of staff. Hannah was working at the ball on the night she disappeared; Talitha was partying there. They may have been friends once, but the upstairs/downstairs dynamic does Talitha no favours. It\u2019s not just class that causes tension. Talitha tells the police that she and Hannah fell out over Talitha\u2019s sex work, and that Hannah accused her of \u201cenabling predators\u201d and covering up sexual abuse on campus. Much like Vigil, made by the same production company, it ladles on idea after idea. There is class, murder and sex, so why not chuck in the political establishment, too? Talitha\u2019s housemate and friend Dillon \u2013 who is pretending to know a lot less about Hannah than he clearly does \u2013 is the son of the shadow environment secretary. According to Talitha, her own father, the weaselly Sir Damian Campbell, is well known for bulldozing an orphanage with children still inside it to build a luxury hotel, but now he is being welcomed on to a government taskforce. It is fair to say that there is a lot going on. It\u2019s odd, then, that this feels like such a slow burn. Talitha is arrested, at first, on suspicion of sending malicious communications to Hannah, and as she stews in her cell in a padded jacket, tapping her neon green nails, she decides to go full Veruca Salt. She preens, she yawns, she giggles inappropriately. She is condescending and rude to police officers and her own lawyer, the lucky duty solicitor who is inevitably brilliant and ends up on the case. Cleo (Tracy Ifeachor) wastes no time whipping her client into shape \u2013 and stressing just how serious things could get. There are so many evil property developers, tough northern detectives and shady establishment figures covering up for their kids in crime dramas these days that they are all starting to blur into the same show: is it Bloodlands, or Marcella, or indeed Vigil? For all its promise of something different, Showtrial initially plays the same tune, teasing out 50 minutes or so of steady plot, before walloping the audience over the head with a showy twist or a development that makes next week\u2019s episode a must-see. For a show that is so interested in entitlement, it does feel oddly entitled to viewers\u2019 attention. Still, it knows what it is doing, and it is solid enough that I now need to know how it gets from A to B. As for whether it will be the show that grips the nation, the jury is still out.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/31/showtrial-review-will-this-schlocky-drama-really-grip-the-nation", "last_update": "2021-10-29T13:39:46Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Tonga face race against time to tighten defence after mauling by Scotland", "article": "Defensive drills will loom large in Tonga\u2019s workload this week after they conceded 10 tries in their 60-14 defeat by Scotland on Saturday. The tourists were due to welcome eight additional players to their squad yesterday as they began preparations for their match against England on Saturday but, with little time to integrate the newcomers, they will surely face similar problems at Twickenham.\nAs individuals the Tongans presented a fierce physical challenge to the home team. As a collective they lacked the solid structure needed to keep a well-drilled home attack at bay. Kyle Steyn in particular exploited that shortcoming ruthlessly, becoming the first Scot since Gavin Hastings in 1995 to score four tries in a Test. Rufus McLean touched down twice, Pierre Schoeman, George Turner, Nick Haining and Oli Kebble also scored tries, and Blair Kinghorn and Ross Thompson added three and two conversions, respectively. David Lolohea claimed the Tongans\u2019 solitary try, to which James Faiva added three penalties. \u201cClearly we had some challenges, especially in the first half, around our defensive organisation and connection,\u201d Tonga\u2019s acting head coach, Grant Doorey, said. \u201cScotland scored a couple of set-piece tries, so that will be a focus area. \u201cBut we will also be working hard to look at the positives. There was a lot of good energy. At times we looked really good with ball in hand; we were able to put pressure on Scotland in different parts of the field. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t manage position and territory, so those position and territory aspects will be absolutely fundamental against England. Clearly we\u2019ll have to work hard on our defensive side of the game to prepare for England.\u201d\nBy contrast Gregor Townsend could hardly have hoped for a more reassuring start to his team\u2019s Autumn Nations Series, although a high penalty count and some defensive lapses will be a concern for the Scotland coach, who said he had been impressed by some of the visitors\u2019 play. \u201cWe were aware Tonga didn\u2019t have their full squad available but I thought they played some good rugby,\u201d he said. \u201cThey showed they should be a growing team over the next few years.\u201d In common with his Tongan counterparts, Townsend will welcome a number of new players to his squad as they prepare for Sunday\u2019s match against Australia. Captain Stuart Hogg and the fly-half Finn Russell are two who appear sure to return to the starting lineup after missing out on Saturday .

The president is also due to travel to Glasgow for the Cop26 climate talks. Biden has been accompanied in Europe by his principal deputy press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. News of a positive test for such a close aide to the president came a little over a year after an outbreak at the White House reached the then president, Donald Trump, who fell seriously ill and was forced to spend time in hospital. In a statement, Psaki said she last saw the 78-year-old Biden on Tuesday, \u201cwhen we sat outside more than 6ft apart and wore masks\u201d. Biden tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday, Reuters quoted \u201ca person familiar with the matter\u201d as saying. Psaki said she stayed in the US \u201cdue to a family emergency, which was members of my household testing positive for Covid-19\u201d. She has two children. \u201cSince then,\u201d Psaki continued, \u201cI have quarantined and tested negative via PCR for Covid on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. However, today I tested positive for Covid. \u201cWhile I have not had close contact in person with the president or senior members of the White House staff since Wednesday and tested negative for four days after that last contact, I am disclosing today\u2019s positive test out of an abundance of transparency.\u201d Psaki also said that \u201cthanks to the vaccine I have only experienced mild symptoms, which has enabled me to continue working from home. \u201cI will plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of the 10-day quarantine following a negative rapid test, which is an additional White House requirement beyond [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance, taken out an abundance of caution.\u201d White House staff and others traveling with the president began undergoing daily tests for Covid-19 before departing Washington and are all fully vaccinated. Many officials have also received booster shots, due to the close-quarters environment and frequent travel associated with their work. Biden got his Covid-19 booster on 27 September, shortly after federal regulators approved the third dose for many Americans. On Sunday Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, responded to the news that Psaki had worn a mask around Biden by tweeting: \u201cGood to still mask up, even if vaxxed.\u201d\nAccording to Johns Hopkins University, the US has recorded nearly 46m cases of Covid-19 and more than 745,000 deaths. Resistance to vaccination mandates remains a concern, particularly among Republican voters, though case numbers are slowing.

The agency said 221,520,153 people had received at least one dose, while 192,453,500 people were fully vaccinated. The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-shot vaccine. About 18.6 million people have received a booster dose.

The British Transport Police (BTP) said: \u201cThere have been no fatalities, however a number of people have been injured. \u201cMost of these people are walking wounded however a small number, including the driver, have been taken to hospital where their injuries are being assessed. \u201cA major incident has been declared and this has been a large scale, multi-agency response working closely alongside our colleagues in Wiltshire.

{"title": "Joe Biden dismisses bad polling and says domestic agenda set to pass ", "article": "Joe Biden sought to brush off concerns about bad polling on Sunday, telling reporters he expected Democrats to overcome internal differences and pass both his domestic spending plan and a bipartisan infrastructure deal in the week to come.\nEarlier, an NBC News poll found that 54% of US adults disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance, down six points since August, a period in which the president\u2019s domestic agenda has stalled amid intra-party division. Biden spoke to reporters in Rome at the end of the G20, before traveling to Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit. He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t run to determine how well I\u2019m going to do in the polls. I ran to make sure that I follow through on what I said I would do as president of the United States. \u201cI said that I would make sure that we were in a position where we dealt with climate change, where we moved in a direction that would significantly improve the prospects of American workers having good jobs and good pay. And further that I would make sure that we dealt with the crisis that was caused by Covid. \u201c\u2026 I believe we will pass my Build Back Better plan. I believe we will pass the infrastructure bill. Combined, they have $900bn in dealing with climate resilience, the largest investment in the history of the world that\u2019s ever occurred. And it\u2019s going to pass in my view, but we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Biden has staked his presidency on his spending plans but Democrats in Congress have been split between progressives and moderates led by two senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Biden delayed his departure to Rome to plead with Democrats to pass his spending agenda. \u201cWe are at an inflection point,\u201d he reportedly told House members. \u201cThe rest of the world wonders whether we can function.\u201d Whether Democrats can deliver could also have significant implications for the midterm elections next year. Historically, parties holding the presidency fail to keep the House. Top Democrats reportedly want a final version of Biden\u2019s $1.75tn spending plan drafted by Sunday and passed by Tuesday. The price tag has come down dramatically, from $3.5tn, with concessions to Manchin and Sinema. The infrastructure deal is valued at $1tn. Discussions continued throughout the weekend. Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate budget committee, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI can tell you, we are working right now. I spent all of yesterday on the telephone \u2026 as soon as I leave the studio, I\u2019m going to be going back home to get on the phone.\u201d Sanders said he was optimistic and added: \u201cThis is not easy stuff, but what we are trying to do is put together the most consequential piece of legislation in the modern history of this country, which will transform the role of government in protecting the needs of working families.\u201d Sanders said he was fighting for action on prescription drugs costs to be included in the spending bill, an issue on which he and Sinema are in very evident opposition. In a 50-50 Senate, and with no Republican support on spending, Manchin and Sinema are key. Democrats must use reconciliation, a way to pass budgetary initiatives via a simple majority rather than 60 votes. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, has the decisive vote. The Senate did pass the infrastructure bill in August via a bipartisan vote but House progressives stymied it in an attempt to win concessions on the spending plan. On Sunday Ro Khanna of California, a prominent House progressive, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation he expected success. \u201cWe are working to add things in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe negotiations are taking place. I\u2019m going to be a yes. I think we can have the vote by Tuesday \u2026 I\u2019m yes on the framework.\u201d Cabinet members also expressed optimism. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, told Fox News Sunday: \u201cWe are teed up for major action soon.\u201d Asked if Congress would pass both pieces of legislation this week, he said: \u201cWe are the closest we have ever been.\u201d Buttigieg also made a point sure to surface in the midterms if Biden is successful, telling ABC\u2019s This Week he \u201cwouldn\u2019t let Republicans off the hook on voting for the family provisions too. \u201cI know they probably won\u2019t but it\u2019s not too late for some of them to join Democrats who are united in believing that the time has come for us to actually put our money where our mouth is [and] support American families.\u201d A Republican senator, Rick Scott of Florida, told Fox News Sunday Biden\u2019s spending had \u201cto end\u201d as it was \u201ccausing inflation\u201d and \u201churting the poor families\u201d. \u201cWe gotta live within our means like every family does,\u201d Scott said.\nAsked if that meant Republicans should support repeal of tax cuts they passed under Donald Trump which are projected to add $2tn to the national debt, Scott said both taxes and spending should be cut. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, suggested Biden\u2019s polling would be boosted when Americans see his spending bill. \u201cThey\u2019ll see that they\u2019re going to get a continuation of that child tax credit,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cThey\u2019ll see people being put to work in clean energy all across this country. \u201cThey\u2019re going to see the ability to have senior citizens and people with disabilities being cared for in their homes. They\u2019ll see their costs of living come down as a result of having children. This bill and the real impacts that people will see will have an impact on those ratings.\u201d In Rome, Biden told reporters: \u201cYou know, you all believed [the spending bill] wouldn\u2019t happen from the very beginning, the moment I announced it, and you always seem amazed when it\u2019s alive again. Maybe it won\u2019t work.

{"title": "New UK Athletics chair to give athletes direct say in how governing body is run", "article": "The new UK Athletics chair, Ian Beattie, has said the management exodus that occurred on his first day in the post has \u201copened up an opportunity to move forward\u201d and draw a line under the past 18 months of turmoil in the sport. In his first interview since taking the helm he has unveiled a radical plan to offer leading athletes a direct say in how the governing body will be run, including the appointment of a new chief executive. It is less than two weeks since the incumbent, Joanna Coates, resigned in tandem with the performance director, Sara Symington, in what many saw as an inevitable changing of the guard following open criticism of the regime from within. Prior to his official arrival on 21 October Beattie had signalled he would immediately conduct an evaluation of UKA\u2019s executive team.\nThe Scot, head of an Edinburgh-based law firm, left little doubt that he foresaw the departures amid a perceived lack of connection with the sport at large since both were transplanted from England Netball. \u201cThe crisis was probably before they resigned,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m maybe trying to be diplomatic. But a lot of coaches were questioning whether the regime was capable of providing that to them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about structures and paperwork. It\u2019s about relationships and people. And developing and having all that support structure. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for someone to come into that role and put a team in place that\u2019s taking a lead. In some ways we\u2019ve shied away from that. But we shouldn\u2019t be. We\u2019re a big athletics nation. We should be able to support our athletes and coaches really well.\u201d With Coates\u2019s desk already cleared, Beattie has turned to her erstwhile deputy, Mark Munro, for the next six months at least, recreating a chair-CEO partnership that won plaudits at Scottish Athletics. Steve Paulding and Tommy Yule, part of UKA\u2019s Loughborough-based backroom team, will assume temporary charge of the performance programme but the recruitment process to succeed Symington has effectively already begun. \u201cThe main candidates have already been in touch,\u201d Beattie revealed. Stephen Maguire, the former relays guru who quit when surprisingly overlooked for the position of Olympic head coach last year, is the presumed front runner. However The Guardian understands Maguire is reluctant to leave his senior role at Sport Ireland despite informal conversations about a return. Stung last time around by what some alleged to be cultural bias against the Northern Irishman, he would surely demand complete control of high performance as a carrot. Until the vacancy is filled, the future of Christian Malcolm, the appointed head coach, will remain up in the air, the Welshman rendered vulnerable by his association with the previous regime and a lack of golds from the Tokyo Olympics. UK Sport will have input into all hirings. But Beattie added: \u201cI\u2019m very keen that we get some involvement from our top athletes in that process.\u201d He and Munro met with their Lottery-funded performers last Thursday to listen and reset. The prime question athletes posed was how their voices might carry greater weight. Beattie offered an illustration. \u201cWhen we replaced Mark at Scottish Athletics, [Olympic medallist] Eilidh Doyle was part of our recruitment panel. And the sport liked it because they felt somebody who\u2019s been at the very top levels was part of the process. I guess I\u2019m looking for the same thing here. That input is important. We\u2019re trying to be inclusive.\u201d UKA management held a springtime meeting with a larger group of international athletes to outline their strategy. World 200 metres champion Dina Asher-Smith, a source confirmed, led vociferous criticism of the rationale for ditching one of the UK\u2019s two high-profile Diamond League meetings, a decision which followed the loss of the sport\u2019s lucrative television deal with the BBC. Beattie, a race organiser in his spare time, suggested a pivot is on the cards. \u201cI\u2019m much more positive on our role on events than maybe we\u2019ve seen for the last couple of years,\u201d he underlines. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of what we do. It gives us a shop front. It gives our athletes exposure, it gives sponsors exposure. I\u2019m very keen to get TV involved again. That\u2019s an important part. And without that, I think we\u2019re missing something.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/31/new-uk-athletics-chair-ian-beattie-athletes-direct-say", "last_update": "2021-11-01T04:15:44Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Paul O\u2019Dwyer died along with two female paddleboarders he was trying to help. A third woman was reported to be in a critical condition. O\u2019Dwyer, 42, a former soldier, jumped into the water in an attempt to rescue two women in distress, but was later pronounced dead on the banks of the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. \u201cPaul put his own life on the line yesterday to make sure others were safe,\u201d said a spokesperson for Aberavon Green Stars RFC, a rugby club O\u2019Dwyer belonged to.

Dyfed-Powys police said they received reports of persons in distress shortly after 9am on Saturday. Emergency services \u2013 including 30 firefighters, the coastguard, RNLI and police helicopters \u2013 arrived at the scene and five people were rescued without injury.\nBut O\u2019Dwyer and two women lost their lives and another woman was being treated in intensive care at a local hospital on Sunday. O\u2019Dwyer died \u201cattempting to save two of the girls also in distress due to an unexpected downpour\u201d, said Vickie Mckinven, who was on the trip but pulled out of the morning paddleboard over weather concerns. It is \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking\u201d, Mckinven said, adding that O\u2019Dwyer \u201cdid so much to raise money for charities\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer cofounded charity SA1UTE, which supports veterans in south Wales, and previously was a soldier with the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers 108 Welsh Squadron militia. \u201cHe was relentless in his drive for raising money for charity,\u201d SA1UTE said in a tribute to O\u2019Dwyer, adding: \u201cWe have lost a friend that gave so much of his life to help others.

He also organised an event in September that raised more than \u00a32,000 for the RNLI and a local lifeguard club. Dyfed-Powys police said the victims\u2019 next of kin were being supported by specialist officers. DCI Jonathan Rees said police were investigating what provoked the tragedy, and called on the public to report any information or submit potential video footage. \u201cAt this stage, my thoughts and the thoughts of my colleagues are with the family of those who lost loved ones, and of the injured person who remains in hospital,\u201d DCI Rees said. DCI Rees urged the public \u2013 with paddleboarding growing in popularity \u2013 to \u201censure they understand the weather conditions and water conditions at a particular location where they may be enjoying that sport\u201d. Salty Dog Co, a watersports clothing shop based in Port Talbot that was involved in the excursion, paid tribute to O\u2019Dwyer. \u201cIt is with heavy heart that we say goodbye to our salty dog Paul,\u201d Salty Dog tweeted on Saturday. \u201cA lovely human being taken too soon.

The French president has accused Australian prime minister Scott Morrison of lying over a major submarine contract. Australia\u2019s carbon neutrality plan is under fire for its over reliance on carbon removal technology. And the Qantas soundtrack is back. Emmanuel Macron has accused the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, of lying to him over an abandoned $90bn submarine contract, in a significant escalation of tensions between Paris and Canberra. The French president levelled the accusation to journalists on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome. Meanwhile, Alok Sharma, president of the Cop26 climate summit, has called on global leaders to \u201cbanish ghosts of the past\u201d and step up with new pledges to lower emissions as the world is running out of time to keep warming below 1.5C. As leaders prepared to fly in for the conference in Glasgow, Sharma could not say with certainty that the two-week event would end with a deal to keep that prospect alive. Morrison\u2019s government has been warned its plan for carbon neutrality by 2050 will fail if it is solely reliant on investing in new technology. The Grattan Institute\u2019s Towards Net Zero report, released today, has suggested the Australian government would need to pull many other policy levers to reach net zero, including vehicle emissions standards, energy efficiency obligations and rules on use of carbon credits. The Australian defence force has tightened its vetting procedures in a bid to prevent nationalist and racist violent extremists from joining. The measures, which include better information sharing with the intelligence agency Asio, are driven by concerns that extremists have sought to join the ADF \u201cto obtain training and capability\u201d.

{"title": "Cop26 summit at serious risk of failure, says Boris Johnson", "article": "The Cop26 climate summit is at serious risk of failure because countries are still not promising enough to restrict global temperature rises to below 1.5C, Boris Johnson has warned.\nIn a blunt admission after two days of preliminary talks at the G20 meeting of world leaders, the prime minister conceded little progress had been made \u2013 and the conference is not on track to achieve a deal that keeps the goal alive. He put the chances of success as \u201csix out of 10\u201d. \u201cCurrently, let\u2019s be in no doubt, we are not going to hit it and we have to be honest with ourselves,\u201d he said. The commitments being made so far were a \u201cdrop in the rapidly warming ocean\u201d. Johnson will set out the scale of the challenge facing humanity as he opens the Cop26 leaders summit on Monday attended by almost 200 national representatives, including US president Joe Biden and India\u2019s Narendra Modi, but missing key players such as China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. He will tell gathered leaders that the world is at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d in terms of keeping warming below 1.5C, with the UN predicting a rise of 2.7C on the current trajectory \u2013 which would lead to catastrophic consequences. He gave his assessment after meetings with G20 leaders at a gathering in Rome, where he said their progress on climate change had only \u201cinched forward\u201d.\nOnly 12 of them have pledged to reach net zero emissions \u201cby or around 2050\u201d. Several key nations \u2013 China and Saudi Arabia \u2013 are only formally pledging to meet that goal by 2060. The UK is also hoping for tougher pledges from countries for 2030, with experts warning emissions need to be halved by this date, when currently they are on course to rise by 15%. Australia, for example, set out a new 2050 net zero target this week, but did not make a headline commitment for this decade. As hosts of Cop26, the UK has the significant role of encouraging and negotiating pledges from almost 200 countries, with many developing nations arguing developed nations have a responsibility to do much more as they have already profited from causing historical emissions. After the leaders meet over the next two days, negotiators will work on texts with the hope of reaching a deal by 12 November.\nJohnson may come back to the summit towards the end if it looks like an agreement may be within touching distance. On the prospects of a deal that keeps to 1.5C, Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s nip and tuck, it\u2019s touch and go. We could do it, or we could fail by the middle of November.\u201d Following the G20, there was a sense of disappointment and some trepidation from No 10 about the outcome of the Glasgow summit, although Labour has accused the government of deliberately lowering expectations in order to declare victory if there is only a modestly improved deal at the end. Speaking at a press conference, Johnson said pledges from countries to lower their emissions needed to be stronger. Experts believe that for 1.5C to have a chance of success, countries need to make substantial and meaningful pledges of reductions by 2030 as well. He will also ask for promises on phasing out coal, the move to electric vehicles, an end to deforestation, and finance \u2013 pledges of money to help developing nations deal with the climate emergency.\n\u201cThe countries most responsible for historic[al] and present day emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf we are going to prevent Cop26 from being a failure, then that must change and I must be clear, that if Glasgow fails then the whole thing fails. The Paris agreement will have crumpled at the first reckoning.\u201d At the Paris agreement, made in 2015, world leaders committedto keeping the global temperature rise below 2C or as close to 1.5C as possible. Johnson said that agreement and \u201cthe hope that came with it\u201d is currently \u201cjust a piece of paper\u201d, which needed to be filled with \u201cgranular\u201d pledges from every country. Global average temperatures have already risen by 1.1C since the Industrial Revolution and only stringent emission cuts will prevent that increase from topping 1.5C. Johnson said there were no \u201ccompelling excuses for our procrastination\u201d, as the world has now seen firsthand the devastation that climate change causes \u2013 from heatwaves and droughts to wildfires and hurricanes. His comments capped a weekend of at times dramatic language on climate change from Johnson, who told reporters travelling with him that he had been converted from previous scepticism following scientific briefings when he entered No 10. Asked if a commitment in the G20\u2019s end-of-summit communique to achieve carbon neutrality \u201caround\u201d the middle of the century was too vague, Johnson said he had hoped for more. \u201cI agree,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is a function really of the gap between some colleagues and others.\u201d Cop26 was going to be tricky, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugar coat it, I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s other than it is. I think there\u2019s a chance that we can make progress, everybody can see how to do it. It\u2019s a question of will and leadership.\u201d Asked whether he had shown sufficient leadership given last week\u2019s budget, which froze fuel duty and cut levies for short-haul flights, and cuts to the aid budget, Johnson pointed to the UK\u2019s achievements in cutting emissions, and targets for phasing out petrol and diesel cars. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street said it would be be contributing a further \u00a31bn over five years to climate finance, taking its commitment from \u00a311.6bn over five years in 2019 to \u00a312.6 billion by 2025. However, the pledged money will be drawn from the foreign aid budget, which Johnson\u2019s government has slashed this year, and is contingent on the UK economy growing as forecast. The G20 communique stressed the importance of fulfilling the commitment to provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) to help poor countries adapt to climate change. The UK has acknowledged that Cop26 is not going to meet the hoped-for $100bn pledge this year. The complex negotiations, which need to resolve more than 130 technical issues as well as the headline issue of \u201ckeeping 1.5 alive\u201d, have already run into logistical trouble owing to Covid restrictions. The main negotiating room has a capacity of 144 because of social distancing. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that \u201cas we have 193 parties, that\u2019s literally not enough\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/31/cop26-summit-at-serious-risk-of-failure-says-boris-johnson", "last_update": "2021-10-31T22:33:14Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Macron accuses Australian PM of lying over submarine deal", "article": "Emmanuel Macron has accused the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, of lying to him over an abandoned $90bn submarine contract, in a significant escalation of tensions between Paris and Canberra. The French president levelled the accusation in impromptu comments to Australian journalists on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome. He said he had a lot of \u201crespect and friendship\u201d for Australia and Australians, but that respect between nations needed to be reciprocated. \u201cI just say when we have respect, you have to be true and you have to behave in line and consistent with this value,\u201d he said. When asked whether he thought Morrison had lied to him by not revealing Australia\u2019s secret dialogue with the UK and US over the acquisition of nuclear submarines, a dialogue that ultimately became the Aukus pact, Macron was direct in his response. \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know,\u201d he said.\nMorrison denied he had lied to the French president. He said he had told Macron that he had formed the view that conventional submarines would not meet Australia\u2019s strategic interests when the two leaders met in Paris after a G7 summit this year. He said when the two had dined together at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, \u201cat that stage we had not concluded any other arrangements with any other parties\u201d. Morrison said he understood Macron\u2019s disappointment, but that he did not resile from the decision to abandon the French contract and proceed with the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the US and UK. He said doing otherwise would have elevated French disappointment above Australia\u2019s national interests. Macron expressed scepticism to Australian journalists that the Aukus nuclear submarines would arrive on schedule. He noted there was an 18-month review of the feasibility of the arrangement, and quipped: \u201cGood luck.\u201d Morrison said he was confident the acquisition would proceed as planned. Under the Aukus pact, Morrison dumped a contract with France to build 12 diesel-powered submarines in favour of a deal with the US for at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. France said it had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d, \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d and \u201cdeceived\u201d. The escalation in tensions comes before a meeting between Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and her French counterpart designed to get the relationship back on track. The dispute with France dominated Morrison\u2019s trip to Rome for the G20 summit. Shortly after Morrison had arrived in Italy, Joe Biden moved to repair his own damaged personal and political relationship with Macron by acknowledging that the Aukus announcement had been a \u201cclumsy\u201d episode handled with a lack of grace. Biden told Macron with television cameras present that he was \u201cunder the impression that France had been informed\u201d about Australia\u2019s intention to ditch the contract \u201clong before\u201d the Aukus pact was revealed publicly. It was unclear whether the US president was rebuking Morrison, or his own senior staff for failing to keep him abreast of the nuances. After Biden\u2019s public rapprochement with Macron, Morrison doubled down on the decision to proceed with the nuclear submarines. He said his government had kept the Biden administration up to date \u201cwith the status of the conversations and discussions with the French government\u201d. Macron met a number of other world leaders while at the G20 summit, but he did not schedule a bilateral discussion with Morrison. Australia\u2019s prime minister will see Macron again at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.

{"title": "Doctor Who recap: Flux chapter one \u2013 the Halloween Apocalypse", "article": "Regular readers may recall that over the summer I went rogue and suggested that if the BBC couldn\u2019t deliver a radically revamped template for Doctor Who for the 2020s, it would be better off canning it. Then we found out that this season would be an interlinked six-parter (a surprise), both Jodie Whittaker (not a surprise) and Chris Chibnall (quite a surprise) were leaving, Russell T Davies would be coming back as showrunner (a jaw-dropper) in a co-production deal between the BBC and Bad Wolf (a new twist), and apparently Sony is trying to purchase Bad Wolf (omg what now?). An emotional roller-coaster for sure, and that\u2019s without taking into account that when we last saw the Tardis fam, Ryan (Tosin Cole) and Graham (Bradley Walsh) were back on top of that Yorkshire hill \u2013 Ryan trying to ride his bike \u2013 having left a rather maudlin Yasmin (Mandip Gill) to carry on travelling alone with the 13th Doctor (Whittaker). And so on to a new series and an opener, the Halloween Apocalypse, which wasted absolutely no time in introducing us to Dan (John Bishop). The episode was big on introducing characters and setting up a disparate set of situations \u2013 via some gorgeous CGI of outer space and planetary destruction \u2013 but didn\u2019t have much of a story to tell. I have long clamoured for a Doctor Who Halloween special that did for the imagery of Halloween what the early Christmas specials did for the festive season, with their robot Santas and killer Christmas trees. But, despite the title, the show didn\u2019t lean into Halloween much at all. Did the episode work to set up the series and as a standalone story? The jury is out. It felt like quite a slight story about Karvanista, interspersed with what could have been the cold openers for five or six other episodes. Sum it up in one sentence? Seven billion dogs save planet Earth from being destroyed by the Flux, while loads of the Doctor\u2019s old enemies knock about in the background. Life aboard the Tardis Yasmin has clearly toughened up a bit since the end of the last episode. She was not shy about challenging the Doctor about the Time Lord keeping secrets, and confident enough with alien tech to get Dan out of his booby-trapped cage. As for Dan, I didn\u2019t dislike him, but didn\u2019t particularly warm to him either. There wasn\u2019t much more to his character than having weird alien stuff happen to him, and responding with sardonic comments. Time will tell, it always does.\nFear factor Sam Spruell\u2019s turn as Swarm was the scariest monster of the day, and looks set to be a sinister opponent in the weeks ahead. He reminded me a little of the Eternals from Can You Hear Me?, and it was clear from the dialogue that he has been in the universe for a very long time. Karvanista\u2019s appearance prompted much hilarity on social media for looking like Chewbacca in the publicity images, but he came across as gruff round the edges, rather than much of a threat. And on screen, he looked more dog than Wookie.\nThe redesign of the Sontarans saw them go back to their original 70s look, and caused speculation that they would once again be a mighty warrior race, rather than the butt of a lot of jokes. The tiny bit of dialogue between them in chapter one suggested to me that their days as comic relief may not be over, however. Mysteries and questions Jodie Whittaker and executive producer Matt Strevens have hinted strongly that we will get some sort of resolution \u2013 or at least further exploration \u2013 of the Timeless Child storyline. And there was some of that in chapter one. We now know that Karvanista worked for the Division \u2013 the mysterious Time Lord organisation that the Doctor may have worked for before their mind was wiped and they were turned into the William Hartnell \u201cFirst\u201d Doctor that we know and love. We also know that the Doctor and Swarm are old enemies. It\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t know that. And I can\u2019t be the only person whose ears pricked up when Annabel Scholey\u2019s mysterious character Claire said that she had come \u201cthe long way round\u201d, a phrase associated in the show with the Doctor\u2019s own journey and the search for Gallifrey. She also seemed to already know exactly what a Weeping Angel was. How?\nDeeper into the vortex Flux is the first six-part live action Doctor Who story to reach BBC One screens since Tom Baker\u2019s The Armageddon Factor was transmitted in 1979. Shada should have been a six-parter the following year, but industrial action halted production, dooming the story to an endless loop of being almost definitively completed via a whole series of almost definitive remakes (there\u2019s another one out on Blu-Ray later this year). The David Tennant-led animation Dreamland was broadcast in six short parts in 2009 on the BBC\u2019s Red Button service and website. The Nitro-9 that the Doctor mentioned in the opening sequence was a type of explosive developed and carried by seventh Doctor companion Ace in the late 80s. It isn\u2019t a surprise that the Doctor Who universe has an alien species of dog people. After all, during the RTD years we met the cat people of New New York, the rhino people known as the Judoon, and the Daleks went through that strange phase of turning their workers in \u201cold\u201d New York into pig people. The Sontarans first appeared in the 1973 Jon Pertwee story The Time Warrior. It introduced the much-missed Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, and was the first story in which the Doctor mentioned the name of his home as Gallifrey. The planet had previously been seen but left nameless in both The War Games and The Three Doctors. Imagine the social media rows we could have had at the time about Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks retconning that into the show. Next time More \u201cI\u2019m the clever one, you\u2019re the potato one\u201d action as we reach chapter two of Flux and witness the War of the Sontarans. We know the Crimean war is going to be a setting, and that nurse Mary Seacole will feature as a historical guest character played by Sara Powell.

{"title": "Mead shines as Arsenal sink Brighton to reach Women\u2019s FA Cup final", "article": "The Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, described the chance to lead his team out in the FA Cup final at Wembley as \u201csurreal\u201d so soon into his tenure and reserved praise for the groundwork laid by Joe Montemurro. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surreal to be honest, you never imagine you will have the chance to win a trophy or be successful so soon,\u201d Eidevall said.\n\u201cThe closest I\u2019ve come to being at Wembley was when I bought tickets for Adele a few years ago but then my wife and I couldn\u2019t go. I\u2019m definitely going this time,\u201d he added with a smile, after a second-half goal and two assists from Beth Mead helped Arsenal to sweep aside Brighton with a dominant 3-0 win. \u201cWe have kept the foundation and we are benefiting from a lot of the relationships and experiences that this group have already made,\u201d Eidevall said. \u201cMy club in Sweden won the Championship last week and I know I\u2019ve been a big part of that, I coached the team for 12 of the games and preseason but still I feel I have nothing to do with it even though I have. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not emotionally connected to it in that moment. We need to recognise the contribution people make to the long-term success of clubs and Joe Montemurro needs to get credit for leaving the club in a good place for me to work with.\u201d After her side\u2019s defeat of Manchester City earlier in the day the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, had said she would love to meet Arsenal in the final on 5 December, the 100th anniversary of the ban on women\u2019s football. She got her wish, as Mead provided for the captain Kim Little and centre-back Leah Williamson either side of her own effort.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have people afraid of playing us than looking forward to it but I know what she means, it\u2019s going to be a great occasion,\u201d Eidevall said of Hayes\u2019s comments. If there was and is a team capable of upsetting the narrative it is Brighton. Last season Hope Powell\u2019s side took points off Manchester United and Chelsea in the Women\u2019s Super League \u2013 all but ending the former\u2019s Champions League charge and rupturing the latter\u2019s air of invincibility as they cantered to the league title. With board backing the growth of the Seagulls has been steady. Two ninth-placed finishes were followed by a surprising jump up to sixth last season. Now they sit fifth with five games played and look capable of climbing higher. Powell, a two-time FA Cup winner herself as a player, teased that the pressure would be on their opponents for the win.\nPredictably though it was Brighton that were immediately under pressure, in footballing terms, at a cripplingly cold Borehamwood. But by the close of the first half Arsenal were frustrated. Despite Arsenal having 64% possession, nine shots to Brighton\u2019s two and six corners to none, the game was goalless, with the Brighton goalkeeper, Megan Walsh, excellent. Arsenal were without the star forward Vivianne Miedema, the US World Cup winner Tobin Heath and the England centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy but, as opposed to recent seasons, these absences were of the manager\u2019s choosing and not enforced. Leading the line, the Australian forward Caitlin Foord went closest in quick succession shortly before the break. The Gunners returned to the field with the bit between their teeth and fuelled by the frustration of their lack of return on their first-half efforts.\nAn almost angry Mead, who has three goals and three assists in five league games and scored four for England in the international break including a 14-minute hat-trick against Northern Ireland at Wembley, sped in from the left, wrongfooted the excellent Maya Le Tissier and passed to Little who flicked up and in. Just four minutes later and a similar burst on the left saw Mead come in from the left before firing low past the watching Walsh. With 15 minutes remaining a Mead corner was powerfully headed in by Williamson to set up the Wembley showdown with Chelsea.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/31/arsenal-brighton-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report", "last_update": "2021-11-01T01:23:15Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Slick West Ham take advantage of Konsa\u2019s red card and subdue Aston Villa", "article": "Heady days at West Ham, who moved level on points with Manchester City in the Premier League\u2019s top four just days after knocking Pep Guardiola\u2019s side out of the Carabao Cup. Aston Villa, too, went into this season with ambitions of jostling with the strongest clubs but they and West Ham look poles apart. This scoreline was a fair reflection of the supremacy of David Moyes\u2019s side even if two of the visitors\u2019 goals came after Ezri Konsa was sent off for Villa, who have much to ponder after a fourth successive defeat.\nAlthough Ollie Watkins briefly drew Villa level by cancelling out Ben Johnson\u2019s opening goal, West Ham always looked the more likely winners. Declan Rice soon made it 2-1 and Villa\u2019s problems deepened before Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen inflicted further punishment late on. From the outset this looked like a contest between two clubs at very different stages of development. West Ham were strong and slick, a formidable collective in which every player knew his part and performed it well. Villa seemed a weak jumble. Dean Smith had tried to avoid a fourth defeat in a row by changing his system and making bold personnel selections, including drafting in Kortney Hause for the dropped captain, Tyrone Mings. But Villa appeared to be gripped by tension as they passed sloppily and lacked energy, standing off their opponents from the first whistle. West Ham were quick to take advantage. In the seventh minute Rice strode through midfield and then floated a pass wide to Johnson on the right. The full-back cut inside Matt Targett with far too much ease before curling a low left-footed shot beyond Emi Mart\u00ednez. It was a splendid finish by the 21-year-old academy graduate, whose emergence since Vladimir Coufal\u2019s injury offers further vindication of Moyes, who had been criticised for not securing a more experienced right-back as deputy to the impressive Czech. Villa\u2019s malaise continued after the early setback. In the 16th minute Matt Cash made important blocks to prevent Bowen from increasing the visitors\u2019 lead. By the 20th minute the home crowd were groaning at Villa defenders for playing the ball around at the back. It was not that Villa were intentionally negative, rather that they seemed unsure how to play their way forward.\nThey were not helped by the loss to injury of Jacob Ramsey in the 15th minute, after which Ashley Young joined the attempt to stop Rice and Toumas Soucek from controlling midfield. Leon Bailey, finally fit enough to make his first start for Villa after electrifying performances off the bench, made little impact. Ditto Emi Buend\u00eda. The encouraging thing for Villa was that when they pressed vigorously for the first time, on the half-hour, Watkins forced Lukasz Fabianski to give away a corner. Two minutes later Cash sent the hosts\u2019 first shot wide from over 20 yards. West Ham were hardly on the ropes but soon Villa landed a blow that counted. John McGinn invited Buend\u00eda to do something useful down the right and the Argentinian obliged, dodging past Fornals and firing in a low cross that found its way to Watkins. The striker finished smartly from 12 yards. Four minutes later West Ham reasserted their supremacy. Rice was again allowed too much space in midfield and he used it to rifle a low shot from 25 yards into the net via the post. Mart\u00ednez, apparently unsighted, was uncharacteristically slow to react. At half-time Villa were fortunate to be only 2-1 down. Their luck soon evaporated, with Konsa sent off moments after the resumption. He was initially only booked for bringing down Bowen just outside the area but the referee, Chris Kavanagh, reached for the red after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor. That seemed unduly harsh but, on the other hand, Hause could have been dismissed for catching Bowen with his elboe in the same move. Villa found purpose after being reduced to 10 men. They nearly equalised after 57 minutes, when McGinn crossed from the right for Watkins. Fabianski tipped the striker\u2019s header onto the crossbar and out. Now West Ham were in a fight. But Fornals soon finished off the hosts. Moments after being booked for an ugly challenge on Marvelous Nakamba, the midfielder rounded off a counterattack by netting from close range after Mart\u00ednez parried a shot by Manuel Lanzini into his path. The fact that Nakamba was still off the pitch receiving treatment infuriated the locals. Lanzini annoyed them further by presenting Bowen with a simple finish after West Ham sliced through Villa again. \u201cThis a special group and a special environment at the minute,\u201d said a jubilant Rice. \u201cThis is the level, the standard. We can\u2019t drop if we want to be a big team.\u201d Smith, aware he is under pressure, insisted that Villa will get back on track. \u201cI believe in this squad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe squad is good enough to turn this round. We need to, we don\u2019t want it to fester.\u201d\n", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/31/aston-villa-west-ham-premier-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:52:57Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Abbie Ward sets England Women on way to record win over New Zealand", "article": "Another day, another giant leap for women\u2019s rugby and the blossoming Red Roses. The full impact of this record-breaking scoreline will not be fully measurable until the live BBC Two television audience figures are collated but outside a World Cup there have not been many feelgood occasions in the English women\u2019s game to beat it. Even if New Zealand were slightly rusty, not having played an international for more than two years, this was still a rare indignity. Their hosts, in contrast, have now won 15 Tests in a row and cemented their world No 1 ranking before next year\u2019s delayed World Cup. Only one of these two teams will be gleefully awaiting the second Test in Northampton next weekend.\nIt might sound greedy to suggest England should have scored more than seven tries but they had the chances to do so. By the end, though, they had inflicted the biggest defeat the Black Ferns have suffered \u2013 the previous record margin was 21-7 against England a decade ago \u2013 and showcased both the fitness of the home forwards and their increasing depth behind the scrum. The eye-catching outcome was even achieved despite the pre-match loss of their vice-captain, Amber Reed, who tweaked a hamstring in training, and the injured Emily Scarratt, with virtually every area of the team contributing. Abbie Ward scored the first two tries and had a third disallowed while Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne were a constant attacking handful. Zoe Harrison also had a good game at fly-half to earn the player of the match award, assisted by the crisp passing of her half-back partner Claudia MacDonald and a strong all-round display from the inside centre Lagi Tuima. It was not quite how New Zealand had planned to mark their 100th Test but a healthy crowd of almost 10,000 enjoyed it hugely on a bright, breezy afternoon. One could tell the locals were up for it by the length of the pre-match pasty queues but this was West Country rugby with a refreshing twist. A female DJ on the decks in the main stand, uninhibited dancing in the aisles, some stirring anthem-singing and, even more unusually, an English rugby team leading New Zealand 17-0 at half-time. At least some of that could just catch on permanently.\nIt did no harm that England made a near-perfect start playing into the stiff, swirling breeze. Given the chance, they have impressive pace out wide and a lovely flick-on under pressure from Kildunne allowed Ward to release the surging Dow. The winger was finally halted 10 metres out but a pop pass off the floor set Ward galloping clear to the line. The strong-running lock\u2019s second try was finished from slightly closer range but again involved Dow making rapid index-linked gains down the left. On a tricky day for every kicker Harrison\u2019s conversion was a well-judged beauty and the pressure being applied to the Black Ferns\u2019 malfunctioning line-out by the athletic Zoe Aldcroft was similarly helpful. New Zealand simply could not win enough ball to unleash their dangerous winger Ayesha Leti-l\u2019iga and, with half-time looming, there was a third English try to admire. The tackling was generous but there was no doubting the elusive spirit that helped the 22-year-old Harlequin Kildunne weave her way to the line. England went off the boil slightly in a sometimes niggly third quarter but they were not finished. After Lark Davies had scored from a close-range maul, there was a lovely debut try for Holly Aitchison, and Dow then scooped up a loose ball to outpace the cover again. Despite a late score from Stacey Fluhler, adding to Alana Bremner\u2019s earlier touchdown, it was Harrison who had the final word to seal England\u2019s first win against New Zealand since a 29-21 victory in Rotorua in June 2017. Small wonder the delighted Red Roses coach, Simon Middleton, described it as a \u201cmassive\u201d statement both for his team and the profile of the women\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a few people who said: \u2018Wow, that was amazing.\u2019 My phone was going into meltdown after the final whistle,\u201d he said. His captain, Sarah Hunter, sounded similarly thrilled as she headed out to celebrate. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy this evening because they don\u2019t come along very often.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/31/england-new-zealand-womens-autumn-international-match-report", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:56:56Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "The Guardian view on Cop26: rhetoric must turn into action in Glasgow | Editorial", "article": "Six years ago, as the Paris accord was agreed amid euphoria at the 21st UN climate conference, the French hosts wisely insisted on a clause obliging countries to match promises with deeds. Having committed to try to hold global temperature rises \u201cwell below\u201d 2C compared to preindustrial times \u2013 and aspire towards a limit of 1.5C \u2013 governments were mandated to produce updated plans in 2020, showing how they would actually achieve that goal. Delayed by a year due to the Covid pandemic, the climate summit now beginning in Glasgow represents that moment of truth. In the words of Laurent Fabius, the former French foreign minister who presided in Paris, Cop26 \u201cis the Cop of action, at which we apply the Paris agreement\u201d. Boris Johnson has acknowledged that there is no prospect of a formal commitment to the 1.5C threshold in Glasgow. But if a pathway to that target is not kept open, the world\u2019s leaders will knowingly be locking the planet into a journey towards environmental catastrophe. This year\u2019s extreme weather events \u2013 the terrible heatwaves, wildfires and floods that have made headlines across the globe \u2013 are evidence that the destructive consequences of global heating are happening faster than expected and on a larger scale. The world today is 1.1-1.2C hotter than in the preindustrial era. Heating beyond 1.5C would deliver even more devastating droughts and crop failures. It would increase the chances of greater famine and ecosystem collapse. There are some signs that the politics of this existential crisis are finally shifting in the right direction. Joe Biden\u2019s $555bn climate mitigation plan, the largest part of his latest Build Back Better proposal, is a start. The president will have to do more for the US to play a leading global role in cutting emissions. China, by far the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has pledged to cease funding coal-fired projects abroad and committed to net zero emissions by 2060. President Xi Jinping has also set an interim peak emissions target of 2030. The European Union has proposed new legislation on industrial emissions, transport and carbon-intensive imports, designed to cut emissions to 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. These moves reflect a belated sense of urgency; but time is running out in the race to close the gap between the total emissions cuts proposed by countries and the level actually required. For the 1.5C target to remain achievable, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be almost halved by 2030. According to the UN, the combined national climate plans of the 197 countries represented in Glasgow do not get anywhere near that. From countries such as Russia and India, which have yet to commit to net zero, far more is needed. Cop26 is unlikely to produce the drama of a Paris-style breakthrough; but it must pave the way for concerted global action to speed up emissions cuts. Concrete measures are required in areas such as phasing out coal, reducing methane gas emissions, preserving carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands, and financing climate mitigation in developing nations. Britain, as the hosts of Cop26, will hold the ring over the next two weeks. It is, to say the least, unfortunate that as Mr Johnson bangs the drum for countries to take more action, his own government is blithely proceeding with new oilfield licensing in the North Sea. It is precisely this kind of gap between rhetoric and action that must be addressed in Glasgow, if the conference is to be judged a success. There is no longer any wriggle room left. What is done and left undone this decade will determine the fate of future generations.

{"title": "The Guardian view on habits: a pandemic of lost routines | Editorial", "article": "The pandemic has broken many things, and among them are habits of a lifetime. Some people forged new norms, and discovered in lockdown new routines (working from home, gardening, baking, exercise, petcare), a tendency only underlined by the repetitiveness of the days themselves. The evident popularity of some new habits, such as cycling, will persist. Repeat something once a day for weeks and it begins to feel automatic \u2013 a habit, in other words. But the scale of the loss is unprecedented. Some habits were good to lose. It is interesting, for instance, that breaking the habit of going to badly paid, exploitative jobs has meant that far fewer people are willing to go back to them, while others have found respite from drinking or overspending. But many would be missed, especially the habit of spending time with others (including family and friends); the habit of enjoying art \u2013 going to the cinema, galleries and, for believers, the habit of worship. Pre-Covid about 15 million people a month went to the cinema, while London theatres attracted the same number every year. Then all of these places went dark. Now they are open again, the challenge is to see whether those routines can be rebuilt. At the most basic level, we need habits in order to cope. \u201cThe skeleton of habit alone,\u201d wrote Virginia Woolf in her X-ray of 1920s English high society, Mrs Dalloway, \u201cupholds the human frame.\u201d Almost two centuries before, the philosopher David Hume argued that \u201ccustom \u2026 is the great guide of human life. It \u2026 makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past.\u201d The repetition of cause and effect builds our trust in the world, in other words, and, further, builds a world as it does so; breaking habits breaks that world. This insight has been buttressed by recent empirical research. Neuroscientists suggest humans are on autopilot up to 43% of the time. Wendy Wood, a professor of social psychology and author of Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes That Stick argues that one reason lockdown was so unsettling was because it threw everyone back into full decision mode. Aspects of the world were broken, and we had to rewire them. There are of course many types of habit, from those acquired through deliberate practice (playing a musical instrument) to those succumbed to (gambling); those acquired through social responsibility (mask-wearing), or those partly social but also driven by an intangible need for something deeper and richer (theatre-going). Some newly acquired obsessions might be better for the human spirit than previously acknowledged: last year, researchers at the University of Oxford reported the surge in playing video games in lockdown could be good for mental health. The good news is that, for the most part, we can actively choose to remake habits we want or need. More than 10 million people went to the cinema in August. A festival of musical theatre in London attracted thousands. Putting to one side, for a short hopeful moment, the current resurgence in Covid cases, this is surely proof that we can rebuild our worlds, one habit at a time.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/31/the-guardian-view-on-habits-a-pandemic-of-lost-routines", "last_update": "2021-10-31T16:55:00Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Gwyn Singleton obituary", "article": "My mother, Gwyn Singleton, who has died aged 87, was a pioneer of dyslexia education in the west of Scotland in the 1970s. Born in Edinburgh, she was raised in Glasgow, where her father, J Mouland Begbie, was leader of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Her mother, Ena (nee Davis-Jones) was a primary teacher until she married. Gwyn attended Laurel Bank school, Glasgow, and despite early dreams of going to Paris to work in couture, she trained as a teacher at Jordanhill College, Glasgow, and that became her lifelong vocation. Her first teaching job was at Haggs Hill primary school, Glasgow. In 1959 she married Ronald Singleton and they had four children. She was a full-time mother for several years. The marriage later ended in divorce. As she rebuilt her career in the70s, she developed an interest in teaching pupils with dyslexia \u2013 an area of specialism that was radical and new. With a few others she started and led Dyslexia ScotWest to provide one-to-one specialist support. She would spend long hours on the phone comforting and advising distraught mothers who had no idea how to help their struggling children. After training as a specialist dyslexia teacher at the Dyslexia Institute in Scotland, Gwyn went back to full-time teaching in schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Like many women of her generation, she felt that she had missed out by not going to university and so completed an Open University degree in education, graduating in the late 1980s. Through the OU she met David Moseley, who became her partner for the second half of her life. She moved to Newcastle and worked at Nunnykirk, a specialist school, until retiring in 1999. In retirement, she and David worked together on a spelling dictionary for children with dyslexia, which was published in several editions. She loved Newcastle and made many friends there. Her retirement years were busy with music and concerts and visits to her children and grandchildren. David died in July this year. She is survived by her four children, Julia, Hilary, Gregor and me, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/31/gwyn-singleton-obituary", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:19:18Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Honour-based\u2019 offences soared by 81% in last five years", "article": "The number of \u201chonour-based\u201d abuse (HBA) offences recorded by English police forces has soared over the past five years, figures suggest. According to data from the 28 out of 39 constabularies that responded to freedom of information (FoI) requests, the number of HBA cases \u2013 including offences such as rape, death threats and assault \u2013 rose from 884 in 2016 to 1,599 last year, a rise of 81%. While some of the increase in HBA offences could be down to more victims coming forward and improved identification of offences by police, Imran Khodabocus, a senior associate at the Family Law Company who represents families in such cases, said the rise was alarming. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s essential education around what honour-based abuse is and how it impacts families is improved across the country. These figures are likely to just show the tip of the iceberg: lockdowns have exacerbated the problem for many and as we continue to get back to normal life, I expect to see even more cases involving honour-based abuse. \u201cOf course, due to the very nature of these cases, it\u2019s likely many victims will never even think to approach the police and the issues are often not recognised by schools, social services or the police.\u201d Forced marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) are other instances of HBA offences committed, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, \u201cto protect or defend the honour of an individual, family and/or community for alleged or perceived breaches of the family and/or community\u2019s code of behaviour.\u201d There are estimated to be 12 to 15 so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings in Britain every year. Notorious cases include Banaz Mahmod, whose father, uncle and other relatives plotted to murder her after she left an allegedly abusive marriage and fell in love with another man; and Samia Shahid, from Bradford, who was killed on a trip to Pakistan. Shahid\u2019s ex-husband and father were arrested in Pakistan in connection with her death but her father died while on bail and nobody has stood trial. The Home Office has collected data from police forces on HBA offences on a mandatory basis since April 2019. Its first figures, described as \u201cexperimental\u201d, showed 2,024 offences recorded in 2019-20, although it said as it was often a \u201chidden\u201d crime, this was likely to have been a \u201csmall proportion\u201d of offences actually committed. Greater Manchester police (GMP) were excluded from the Home Office figures because they could not supply data owing to installation of a new IT system, and were unable to respond to the FoI request either. Karma Nirvana, a charity that supports victims of honour-based violence, said the omission of figures from GMP, England\u2019s third biggest force, was significant as the area generates a lot of calls to its helpline. Natasha Rattu, the director of Karma Nirvana, acknowledged police identification of such crimes was better, albeit still with room for improvement, but said: \u201cThe fact that there are increases suggests that people are and have been feeling more desperate or more at risk.\u201d The charity wants a fresh review of policing of honour-based abuse by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary as it says many of the recommendations of the last report, in 2015, which found police were not doing enough to protect victims, have not been implemented. A National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe acknowledge that these abuses are hugely under-reported and we remain focused on giving victims the confidence and come forward. I urge anyone with information or concerns about honour-based violence to contact the police \u2013 your report will be taken seriously.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/31/honour-based-offences-soared-by-81-in-last-five-years", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:30:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "David Minnikin obituary", "article": "My father, David Minnikin, who has died aged 81, was a researcher in the field of mycobacteria \u2013 the bacteria that cause diseases such as tuberculosis. His work identifying the chemical make-up of the waxy shield around these cells led to new treatments being developed for the disease. His method for identifying the chemicals in the cell shield, enabling drugs to be targeted at them, became known as the \u201cMinnikin method\u201d. David was born in Newton, a village west of Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Jane (nee Telfer), a farmer\u2019s daughter, and Thomas Minnikin, a gardener. He attended a local school in Corbridge, and sat the entrance exams to Lord Wandsworth college, in Hampshire, gaining a scholarship as a boarder. He excelled academically and took a keen interest in sports. From there he won a scholarship to study chemistry at Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1963, and going on to take a DPhil on the chemistry of the lipids of tubercle bacilli at the Dyson Perrins laboratory in 1967. That year he became a senior research officer at the inorganic chemistry department of the University of Newcastle, where he mentored young researchers and students. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1985. His early studies in the 1980s used specific bacterial lipids as a fingerprint to identify and group bacteria, in particular antibiotic-producing bacteria. In 1982, he described the waxy coat of unusual lipids and sugars around the tuberculosis organism, which provided a shield against common antibiotics. His subsequent studies based on \u201cthe Minnkin model\u201d identified several new drugs that would weaken this shield, thereby shaping efforts in drug discovery against tuberculosis. This is recognised as a landmark in mycobacterial research \u2013 and all carried out before the era of genomics. In 2002 he was appointed professor of microbial chemistry at Newcastle. The same year, he moved his research to the University of Birmingham. There, with Gurdyal Besra, he established a new world-leading research group on tuberculosis. In his latter years, he developed a keen interest in tracing the evolution of the same type of infections, causing leprosy as well as TB. He never really retired, but officially stepped down from Birmingham university in 2007. He continued to write papers and chapters for books as well as assessing PhD students. David was a keen sportsman, with a particular passion for cricket and his home team in Newton, where he grew up. He was also a keen mountaineer and hill walker all his life. His retirement allowed him to finish all the Munros (peaks over 3000 feet in Scotland) and the Lakeland Wainwrights tops, from his home base in Threlkeld, Cumbria. David was widowed twice. His first wife, Susan (nee Stow), my mother, died in 2000. His second wife, Marion (nee Turner) died in 2020.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/31/david-minnikin-obituary", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:14:35Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Fun and freedom inspire Jos Buttler\u2019s fearless innings against Australia", "article": "The T20 World Cup has been played to a very particular soundtrack. The stadium DJs have been most noticeable, filling every macroscopic pause in play with overamplified banter and snippets from a curiously curated playlist \u2013 the inclusion of Mysterious Girl, the 25-year-old Peter Andre hit, in particular takes some explaining. Those in the ground also have to deal with constant roaming food and drink hawkers plying their wares, and then of course there are the fans themselves, who vary enormously in number and volume depending on their nation. But in England\u2019s thrilling victory against Australia on Saturday Jos Buttler inspired another, rarer sound: collective groans of awed appreciation.\nIt is one that has been heard in Dubai before. \u201cThere was actually a game that we were talking about while he was going bananas out there, where he scored a 46-ball hundred where very similarly, he just seemed to hit the middle of the bat over and over again,\u201d Eoin Morgan said on Saturday night, remembering the fourth game of a 50-over ODI series in 2015 against Pakistan \u2013 a series played, like this World Cup, in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Dubai. \u201cThat\u2019s a while ago now but every time you come and play here there are obviously great memories,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cWe were in the same dressing room as well on that day. It just has a nice feel about it, remembering that sort of day. So absolutely that gives you confidence, to know you are coming back to a ground where you have probably played your best innings.\u201d The first inkling that Saturday was going to be Buttler\u2019s night occurred in training 24 hours earlier. \u201cI had a great practice. Some of the practice wickets have been a bit tricky but on Friday I managed to have some great practice,\u201d he said. \u201cI think all the batsmen enjoyed it. It\u2019s nice to put your hands through a few, have some fun and freedom. I had a lot of fun at practice and took that into the game today.\u201d\nThe confidence the 31\u2011year\u2011old gained in that session flowed straight into Saturday night\u2019s match, an innings that reached its apogee in the sixth over when two Mitchell Starc deliveries were deposited just a few seats away from each other in the top tier of the stands. \u201cPractise it and the confidence stays,\u201d he said. \u201cAdrenaline is going but you\u2019re still trying to remain quite level in your brain and sort of relaxed in the top half. When guys are bowling fast, you have that level of adrenaline. We got to the fifth over with no wickets down and that allows you a licence really to attack.\u201d After seeing him hit 71 runs off 32 balls, Liam Livingstone said: \u201cIt was a pleasure to just sit there and watch a genius at work.\u201d Livingstone said Buttler was \u201cthe best hitter of a white ball in the world\u201d, a description echoed by Adil Rashid. \u201cHe\u2019s done that many a time over the years,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cIt\u2019s the variety of shots he\u2019s got, the power he\u2019s got, the fearlessness, putting bowlers under pressure. All this combined makes him one of the best white-ball batsmen in the world.\u201d Buttler\u2019s innings helped to establish England\u2019s superiority in Group One of the Super 12s not just on points but also, and by a massive margin, on net run rate, their three successful run chases having been polished off with 34, 35 and then 50 balls to spare. With two games remaining, starting against Sri Lanka in Sharjah on Monday, their position in the semi-finals already looks secured, but the players insist there will be no loss of focus. \u201cThat\u2019s part and parcel of the job, that\u2019s what we are required to do as cricketers and professional sportsmen,\u201d said Rashid. \u201cOur mindset is exactly the same whoever we play against, there won\u2019t be anything different. We don\u2019t look too far ahead, we don\u2019t think about winning the World Cup. That is still a long way away. We\u2019re just thinking about the next game, which is Sri Lanka, and doing the job there, and then next game from there. We won\u2019t look too far ahead and think about the final and stuff.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/31/fun-and-freedom-inspire-jos-buttlers-fearless-innings-against-australia", "last_update": "2021-10-31T16:02:52Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Greece lets boat packed with Afghan refugees dock after four days at sea", "article": "After roaming the high seas for four days as Greece and Turkey haggled over its fate, a cargo ship packed with hundreds of Afghan refugees has been allowed to dock at an Aegean island, with passengers disembarking to apply for asylum. In what Greece\u2019s migration ministry called \u201can unusual and special case\u201d, the Turkish-flagged vessel was towed into the port of Kos on Sunday. About 375 passengers, the biggest single influx of asylum seekers in years, were taken to a reception centre on the island. Six others were detained for questioning and one woman was admitted to hospital on the island of Karpathos. Greek coastguard officials said those onboard were mostly young Afghan males. Many were reported to be hungry and dehydrated after an ordeal that began on Thursday when the freighter, initially bound for Italy, developed engine trouble and sent out a distress signal off the island of Crete, shortly after setting sail from Turkey. Days of negotiations between Athens and Ankara followed after the Greek government appealed via the European Commission for Turkey to take the vessel back in line with a 2016 accord reached with the EU intended to staunch migrants flows. When the Turkish authorities made clear they would not be accepting the ship, Greek coastguard officials launched what they called one of the largest search and rescue operations in the eastern Mediterranean. The country\u2019s minister for migration and asylum policy, Notis Mitarachi, described the incident as \u201canother dangerous and illegal journey from the Turkish coast \u2026 facilitated by criminal gangs\u201d. He said on Sunday: \u201cWe have notified the EU that Turkey has refused to take their vessel back. Greece has rescued hundreds of thousands of people in the last seven years. It is time for the EU to act and provide impactful solidarity and ensure the [2016] EU/Turkey statement is upheld. \u201cUnlike Turkey and others that ignored the problem, Greece stepped up, providing immediate humanitarian support to people in need as we always do. But Greece cannot solve the migration crisis alone.\u201d\nNumbers have dropped precipitously but Athens and Ankara have been in a war of words over migrant arrivals. Since the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan in August, fears have mounted among EU states of a replay of the 2015 refugee crisis when almost 1 million Syrians streamed into Europe via Lesbos and other frontline Aegean islands. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of forcibly returning boats crammed with asylum seekers into Turkish waters by pursuing a policy of pushbacks, and has invited the international media to witness such incidents. Athens has charged Turkish authorities with deliberately escalating tension by encouraging smugglers to organise the illicit journeys. The NGO Aegean Boat Report said Greek authorities were made aware through local media reports that the cargo ship was in distress, but that they held off confirming the incident, raising fears that another pushback was under way. None of those onboard wanted to return to Turkey because they did not consider it a safe country, the organisation said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/greece-lets-boat-packed-with-afghan-refugees-dock-after-four-days-at-sea", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:36:40Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Particularly disappointing is the miserly support for low carbon energy. Energy companies have made some impressive investments in wind-powered and solar energy in Britain, but businesses will invest only where the risks are relatively low and the likelihood of profits relatively high. That leaves a whole range of actions that must be taken to decarbonise the economy, but where the private sector will not venture. Only the government has the economic power to take the risks that business shies away from, but Rishi Sunak has failed to pledge government support for decarbonisation to industry. David Humphreys Professor of environmental policy, Open University \u2022 In this week\u2019s Cop26, countries will be urged to follow the UK\u2019s \u201clead\u201d in setting the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal is impossible for any advanced economy based on mass consumption. The majority of British manufacturing has shifted abroad, where labour is cheap and items are mostly produced with electricity supplied by coal and other fossil fuels. For a real figure for Britain\u2019s emissions, the consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. It is a dangerous nonsense for rich countries, therefore, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a child born in Africa. For a meaningful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over PR. We may pull the wool over our own eyes, but nature cannot be cheated. Michael Stone Moretonhampstead, Devon \u2022 Your print headline, \u201cA thundering wake-up call\u201d (Report, 26 October), highlights a recent UN report that the world faces a disastrous temperature rise of at least 2.7C if countries fail to strengthen their climate pledges. With the Cop26 summit, hopes are high for pledges that will keep the planet from warming by no more than 1.5C, but expectations are low. We can expect the \u201cblah blah blah\u201d (to coin a phrase) to include planting more trees, replacing diesel and petrol cars with electric vehicles, more insulation of homes, more offshore wind farms and solar panels. Not now, but by 2050. The prime minister is looking for a pledge by developed countries for $100bn for less wealthy nations to help them adapt to climate change. Here is an alternative suggestion: let the rich nations pledge $100bn to a climate crisis project group consisting of the world\u2019s top scientists. A bit like the Manhattan Project (but not trying to make an atomic bomb), these scientists will be charged with developing new tools in the fight to save the planet, such as technologies to scrub the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and store renewable energy. In the face of a crisis, human ingenuity knows no bounds. Dr Steve Hyer Wellington, Surrey \u2022 The sound of fiddles being tuned up and deckchairs scraping across decks are all we will hear at Cop26.

While the specific changes in clauses 1 and 2 of the current bill are actually relatively narrow and technical, I share his concerns about the attitude they reveal. Recent government statements demonstrate that the bill is only the opening skirmish in an effort to shield government power from legitimate oversight. The government frames its desire to curb judicial review as correcting an illegitimate political power grab against elected legislators by unelected judges. In fact, the government seeks to arrogate more power to itself. Judicial review exists to enable independent courts to act as parliament\u2019s watchdog and ensure that public bodies abide by the law and interpret it correctly. The legal questions raised are \u201cpolitical\u201d insofar as all wielding of state power is political, but judicial review is not about second-guessing policy choices, it is rather about upholding legislation. A judge\u2019s role is to check whether decisions are within the decision-maker\u2019s legal power and rationally made, following the proper procedures. If the government wants to modify the laws and procedures in question it is free to do so, but until that happens the courts require public bodies to obey the law as it stands. A significant curtailment of judicial review would place the government and public bodies above the law. Although Davis may be right that this aim \u201cshould come as no surprise\u201d, it is no less worrying in its implications for being expected.

From Brondesbury and Kilburn high school Daphne went to King\u2019s College London, where she studied French and Spanish. After graduation, she undertook a year\u2019s teaching training, also at KCL. In 1945 she met Albert Heiser through the Labour party, and they were married in three years later. They moved to Peterborough in 1953, and she lived there for most of the rest of her life. Daphne taught at a variety of schools, notably Peterborough county girls\u2019 school. A dedicated and enthusiastic languages teacher, she is remembered by past pupils for her good classroom management and the hard work she expected from them. She made contacts with schools abroad and paired up the pupils with pen-friends, organising school exchanges, spending weeks of her holidays abroad with the students, providing hospitality and putting on a programme of outings on the return visits. She took career breaks when my sister and I were born in the late 50s, and when we lived in Brazil and Spain, due to our father\u2019s job as an engineer. As a proponent of immersive language teaching, she thought nothing of sending us to local schools, where we were taught in Portuguese, then Spanish. Daphne was a keen promoter of town-twinning and was active in establishing Peterborough\u2019s links with Alcal\u00e1 de Henares in Spain and Bourges in France. She was a co-opted member of the city council\u2019s twinning committee. She was also president of the Peterborough Hispanic Society and active in the Anglo-French association. In recognition of her work promoting ties with Spain, in 2012 she was appointed Encomienda (Commander) of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the king and foreign minister of Spain. Albert died in 1993. Daphne is survived by her children, Sarah and me, her grandchildren, Ellie and Ruth, and her sister, Vivienne.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/31/daphne-heiser-obituary", "last_update": "2021-10-31T17:48:21Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Alex Lozowski leads Saracens to dramatic win against Harlequins", "article": "The clocks have gone back and we seem to have returned to the recent past when Saracens ruled the roost in the English club game. They are back after their year in exile from the Premiership and with a vengeance. On the previous two Sundays they had gorged themselves on 126 points in wins against Bath and Wasps. This time, though, Saracens escaped to victory, coming from behind to win the game with a late try from Jackson Wray.\nIt was the champions Harlequins\u2019 first home Premiership defeat of the year and they will wonder how this one got away after they had led 19-9 at the break with an autumn gale behind them. They were eventually blown away by a match-winning display by Alex Lozowski, stepping in for Owen Farrell at fly-half, who scored 19 points in another peerless display. \u201cI think we were second-best for much of the game. We really had to dig in there,\u201d he said. With international call-ups robbing the fixture of a few star names, Danny Care, long ago considered surplus to requirements by Eddie Jones, was handed the Harlequins captaincy while Lozowski was back in a position in which he had looked so at home in the opening fixture at Bristol. Care\u2019s half-back partner Tommy Allan was soon the victim of a late challenge by Vincent Koch. The ensuing penalty gave Quins the platform to launch an attack that gave the young lock Hugh Tizard the chance to finish for the first try of the afternoon. It was the perfect start for Quins but they soon conceded a couple of soft penalties, one of them converted by Lozowski. Allan did not seem too affected from that early hit by Koch and the Italy international soon set up a second try. From a ruck Allan\u2019s wonderful long pass to Tom Lawday gave the No 8 the opportunity to set up the wing Cadan Murley for the chance to break Alex Goode\u2019s tackle and score in the corner. The physicality of the match was unrelenting. Allan soon left the field for a head injury assessment he failed and was replaced by Will Edwards, a former England sevens player who does not lack pace but probably did not expect too much time on the field. Lozowski continued to chip away at the Quins lead but when a Saracens move broke down in midfield, the flanker Jack Kenningham took advantage to plough upfield, would\u2011be tacklers bouncing off him. He gave Lawday another chance to set up a try after he had given a firm hand\u2011off to Koch. Lawday\u2019s pass to Tyrone Green, who was looking razor-sharp at full\u2011back, glided over in the corner for a third try. Dino Lamb, the Quins lock, was sent to the sin-bin for clearing out a maul a little too enthusiastically but the champions led by 10 points at the break. The question was would that be enough with the strong wind behind the visitors in the second half. There was a scare when Dom Morris cashed in with a sharp try against a side still handicapped by Lamb\u2019s absence but Quins replied with a smart drop-goal by Care. It was his eighth drop-goal, the most by any Premiership No 9. The momentum was back with the home side and the crowd found its voice. Stephan Lewies, who had led Quins to their title but has been out of the side with a foot injury, made a welcome return to bolster the home pack. Edwards struck an upright with a penalty before Lozowski converted successfully at the other end to reduce the deficit to three points. Saracens won a penalty at the breakdown through good work by Wray. Lozowski was having one of those days and Saracens were level. There was a sting in the tail. Four minutes from time Saracens moved the ball wide, Lozowski straightened the line and Alex Lewington slipped a pass for Wray to squeeze over in the corner. Inevitably Lozowski converted from the touchline. The only downside for Saracens was the sight of Billy Vunipola hobbling off with a knee injury in the last minute.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/31/harlequins-saracens-premiership-rugby-union-match-report", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:11:06Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Simon Zukas obituary", "article": "My friend Simon Zukas, who has died aged 96, first became prominent in the political life of Northern Rhodesia (later Zambia) in 1951, as one of the founders and leaders of a radical, and predominantly African, committee that opposed the establishment of the settler-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In April 1952 the colonial government, holding that he was \u201ca danger to peace and good order\u201d, sought to deport him to the UK, a country with which he had no connection. He was held in prison in Livingstone for eight months and was then removed to London in December 1952. Appeals against his deportation, which went as far as the privy council, failed. Born in Ukmerg\u0117, Lithuania, the son of Chaim and Libe Zukas, Simon had arrived in Northern Rhodesia with his family in July 1938, a few days before his 13th birthday. His father had left Lithuania in 1936 with no foreknowledge of the catastrophe that was soon to strike the Jewish population. Simon arrived in Ndola speaking only Yiddish and Lithuanian, but he was soon top of the class. Within five years he had won a scholarship to study civil engineering at the University of Cape Town. He volunteered to do wartime military service and spent three years with African troops in East Africa. Taking up his university place in 1947, he became a radical socialist. He was close to, though not then a member of, the Communist party of South Africa. In exile in London from 1953, he became a co-founder of the Movement for Colonial Freedom and was from 1960 a member of the London committee of the United National Independence party (UNIP). He met and in 1954 married Cynthia Robinson, a South African artist, and set up a successful civil engineering consultancy. He was given a hero\u2019s welcome on his return to Zambia before independence in 1964. For more than 20 years he devoted himself to civil engineering and commercial farming, but in 1990, disillusioned with the one-party state and Zambia\u2019s economic decline, he became a founder of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD). Following the defeat of President Kenneth Kaunda and UNIP in 1991, he joined the new government and served as minister of agriculture and then public works. He resigned in 1996 over a matter of principle relating to the political rights of immigrants and their children, but returned to politics in 2001 as one of a group, the Oasis Forum, that successfully opposed Frederick Chiluba\u2019s attempt to secure an unconstitutional third presidential term. He then became chair of a new opposition party, the Forum for Democracy and Development (FDD), stepping down in 2005. He never, however, retired from political life. Ten days before his death, he led a deputation of elders to call upon the newly elected president, Hakainde Hichilema. Always committed to democracy, he welcomed Zambia\u2019s third change of government through the ballot box. His state funeral was marked by a day of national mourning. He is survived by Cynthia, their sons, David and Alan, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/simon-zukas-obituary", "last_update": "2021-10-31T17:33:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},

Hundreds of activists in Halloween costumes marched through Edinburgh and held a rally outside the Scottish parliament. Meanwhile the Cop26 Coalition, which includes civil society groups, indigenous communities, anti-racist groups and frontline activists from the global south, launched its campaign just a few hundred metres from the official conference venue in Glasgow. Community leaders from the Minga Ind\u00edgena collective, which represents indigenous communities in North and South America, were presented with a ceremonial stone, and Asad Rehman of War on Want told the audience the world was \u201cstanding on the edge of catastrophe\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are peering over the edge and if we want to stop that spiralling out of control we have to act right now, in this decade.\u201d Rehman said the climate crisis was already wreaking havoc in every country and was a result of a system that exploited people and resources for the benefit of a few. \u201cEven today in the corridors of power in the negotiations our governments are making decisions which basically say the lives of black, brown and indigenous people, of the poor and of women, are not worth saving \u2026 and the priority is the extraction of profit.\u201d Rehman said the challenge facing campaigners was to build solidarity between climate justice movements in the global south and north and to highlight the connections between various interlinked crises, from inequality to racism, climate breakdown to sexism. \u201cWe must tell a story of the world we want to create \u2026 that is not just about a just transition but a justice transition, not just about cutting carbon but cutting injustice,\u201d he said. The Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior, carrying activists from some of the countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, will attempt to sail up the River Clyde on Monday, despite the autorities refusing it access.

{"title": "Brendan Kennelly obituary", "article": "The poet Brendan Kennelly, who has died aged 85, invited readers to embrace and understand their polar opposites. His most ambitious and controversial work, Cromwell (1983), addressed the archetypal enemy of his native Ireland \u2013 Oliver Cromwell as commander of the English campaign there in 1649-50 \u2013 empathetically. The Book of Judas (1991), a 400-page work that was a bestseller in Ireland, suggested that the classic traitor had loved, and indeed created, the man whom he betrayed with a kiss. This insistence on acknowledging \u201cthe Other\u201d marked a reaction to \u201cthe obscenity of labelling people\u201d and the need for the \u201cviolation of inherited prejudices\u201d. Kennelly insisted that \u201cIrish people must become English imaginatively, Protestants become Catholics and men become women\u201d. In selecting five poems to render into Greek, the translator Vera Konidari told me that she settled on ones that formed \u201ca sort of confession of a man who tries to come to terms with conflicts, his language, the past which merges with the present. It represents a spiritual journey.\u201d With regard to his most anthologised poem, My Dark Fathers, Kennelly himself told me: \u201cPoetry is written by blind men groping for the light\u201d \u2013 here, evoking the silencing of spontaneous artistic expression by the famine that followed the failure of the Irish potato crop in the 1840s: Upon the headland, the encroaching sea Left sand that hardened after tides of Spring, No dancing feet disturbed its symmetry And those who loved good music ceased to sing. His sense of quest and confession was particularly vivid for those who heard his public readings. Kennelly was both a sensualist, revelling in the erotic, exotic and extravagant in the natural world, and also acted as a social conscience: for many Irish people in an era of radical social transformation, he symbolised the transition from rural to urban life. He could relish the city of Dublin, but always in the light of the enduring qualities of village life, imprinted during childhood and adolescence. Born in Ballylongford, near Listowel, Co Kerry, Brendan was the son of Bridie (nee Ahern), a nurse, and Timmie Kennelly, a publican. The inspiration and perspective of the hamlet in south-west Ireland remained a world of intensities, as brought out in My Dark Fathers. Kennelly was educated locally before winning a scholarship to Trinity College Dublin. After some hesitation \u2013 working as a clerk in the Electricity Supply Board and as a bus conductor in London \u2013 he gained a degree in English and French from TCD (1961), and studied with Derry (Norman) Jeffares at Leeds University, where he took a PhD with a thesis on modern Irish poets and the Irish epic. He started working as a lecturer at TCD in 1963. As professor of modern literature (1973-2005) at TCD he won the affection of students \u2013 among them long-term prisoners in Irish jails \u2013 for his wide-ranging and uninhibited approach to the subject. A Kennelly lecture was an occasion, an idiosyncratic performance of deeply felt humanity, humour and compassion. His work as a critic, including his masterly essay on WB Yeats, An Experiment in Living, appeared in the collection Journey Into Joy (1994). He held visiting professorships in the US and the Netherlands, and served three terms as chairman of Ireland\u2019s Cultural Relations Committee, promoting the country\u2019s culture abroad. To mark his 85th birthday earlier this year, TCD launched the Brendan Kennelly Literary Archive. In 1969 he married Peggy O\u2019Brien, who had come to Dublin as a student from Massachusetts, and they had a daughter, Doodle (Kristen). The breakdown of the marriage and his subsequent treatment for alcoholism led him into translations of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s Blood Wedding (1996) and of classic texts, Medea, Antigone and The Trojan Women, published as When Then Is Now (2006). In these Kennelly gave full voice to the rage of women betrayed, belittled and degraded, who not merely assert the strengths of their womanhood but state their otherness to the prevailing male orthodoxy. Woman became for him the centre of both beauty and anger. Yet Kennelly never overcame his own fear of women, which he attributed to the Catholic upbringing that insisted that woman was \u201can occasion of sin\u201d. In writing as in sport \u2013 he was a good footballer \u2013 Kennelly displayed grace under pressure. Heart bypass surgery in 1996 left him physically frail and increasingly withdrawn. Yet emotionally and imaginatively he continued thirsting for the ecstatic: \u201cI\u2019d like to become a poem,\u201d he told me, \u201cto become coherent and accomplished and singing.\u201d One of his most effective \u2013 his signature of affirmation and celebration \u2013 is Begin: Though we live in a world that dreams of ending that always seems about to give in something that will not acknowledge conclusion insists that we forever begin. His marriage ended in divorce in 1987, and Doodle died in April this year. He is survived by three brothers, two sisters and three grandchildren. \u2022 Timothy Brendan Kennelly, poet and academic, born 17 April 1936; died 17 October 2021", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/31/brendan-kennelly-obituary", "last_update": "2021-11-01T10:54:05Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "G20 pledge to take climate action criticised for \u2018lacking ambition\u2019", "article": "World leaders meeting at the G20 summit in Rome have agreed that countries must take meaningful action to keep the world from warming by no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but are facing criticism for offering few concrete commitments in order to reach the target. Sunday\u2019s final communique did not include a commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The G20 leaders instead agreed to wording that underlines the importance of reaching net zero by or around the middle of the century, phrasing that meets the positions of China and Saudi Arabia. Greenpeace condemned the statement as weak and \u201clacking ambition and vision\u201d, and said G20 leaders had \u201cfailed to meet the moment\u201d before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. \u201cIf the G20 was a dress rehearsal for Cop26, then world leaders fluffed their lines,\u201d said its executive director, Jennifer Morgan. Tom Burke, of the E3G thinktank, however, praised the changes in the language agreed. \u201cThis is a shift from what they have previously said. The crucial words are on this decade. Previously they had only talked about 2050, which is too far away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an expression of a growing sense of urgency in the G20, driven by both events and science. This is a political signal that will add momentum to the Cop and help in reaching agreement at Cop. We were not expecting this language.\u201d The communique does set out plans to end overseas investment in coal this year \u2013 something China has agreed to do \u2013 and to take unspecific actions to limit domestic coal use. Objections from Turkey to the passage on coal were lifted early on Sunday morning, leading to a rare outbreak of cheers from exhausted drafting officials at their first large, in-person gathering since the start of the Covid pandemic. The whole of the G20 summit was seen as a test of multilateralism\u2019s durability after a period in which the world responded to the pandemic by looking inwards. The communique said: \u201cWe will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase out and rationalise over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d A reference in an earlier draft to reducing carbon emissions significantly, which Turkey had opposed, was removed in favour of a phrase saying a reduction in fossil fuel use is \u201cone of the most feasible, efficient and quickest ways to limit climate change\u201d. The Italian hosts were delighted by the outcome, saying they had done \u201cthe heavy lifting for Boris Johnson\u201d and the British hosts in Glasgow. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, who chaired the G20 summit, recalling the words of Greta Thunberg at the Youth4Climate conference in Milan in September, said at the closing press conference: \u201cMany say they are tired of \u2018blah, blah, blah\u2019. I believe this summit was full of substance. We have filled the words with substance.\u201d Draghi added: \u201cNow, for the first time, the whole of the G20 recognises the scientific validity of the one-and-a-half-degree goal, and they commit themselves with a sufficiently significant language.\u201d He said: \u201cSomething has changed at this summit. The G20 has rediscovered the ability to face epochal challenges: Covid-19, climate, health, gender and wealth inequalities. And all these we have discovered are challenges that we cannot overcome alone.\u201d Joe Biden said the summit had shown \u201cthe world\u2019s trust in America was back\u201d, adding that the US had shown up and is now the most critical part of the agenda. He said he was disappointed that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, did not travel to Rome. The US president said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made significant progress [on the climate crisis], and more has to be done, but it\u2019s going to require us to continue to focus on what China\u2019s not doing, what Russia is not doing and what Saudi Arabia is not doing. \u201cWe will not switch to renewable energy overnight. No one had anticipated that this year we would be in a position, or even next year, that we are not going to use any more oil or gas or we are not going to be engaged in any more fossil fuels. We are just going to stop subsidising fossil fuels. \u201cThe idea that we are not going to need gas for automobiles is not realistic, but we will get to the point where by 2050 we will have zero emissions. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was less enthusiastic, saying: \u201cWhile I welcome the G20\u2019s commitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled but at least not buried forever.\u201d\nThe climate progress was matched by other agreements over the weekend on global taxation, ending the US-EU trade dispute and a commitment to vaccinate 40% of the world\u2019s population against Covid by the end of the year and 70% by the middle of next year. The communique calls for countries \u201cto update and advance where necessary\u201d nationally determined contributions on carbon emissions this decade, and stresses the importance of fulfilling the commitment to provide $100bn (\u00a375bn) to help poor countries adapt to climate change. The UK has acknowledged that Cop26 is not going to meet the hoped-for $100bn pledge this year. The language goes just beyond what was agreed six years ago in Paris, when the climate deal called for capping global warming at well below 2C, and ideally closer to 1.5C. Experts say it means halving carbon emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. China, one of the world\u2019s largest emitters, has said it will meet net zero by 2060. On the future of coal, the most contentious issue in framing the agreement, the communique reads: \u201cWe will put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021.\u201d In terms of domestic coal use, the statement contains only a vague pledge to support those countries that commit to \u201cphasing out investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity to do so as soon as possible\u201d.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/g20-pledge-to-take-climate-action-criticised-for-lacking-ambition", "last_update": "2021-10-31T23:01:23Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Annie Evans obituary", "article": "My friend Annie Evans, who has died aged 68 of cancer, was unassuming, understated and modest. She made a significant contribution to social housing in London and was also a talented artist. Born and brought up in Portsmouth, Hampshire, Annie was the only child of Irish parents, Hilda (nee Whelan) and Green Evans. Her father came to Britain during the second world war and joined the RAF. Her mother was a nurse who worked at the Victoria hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex, at the burns unit that treated the RAF aircrew who came to be known as members of the Guinea Pig Club.\nFamily holidays were spent touring Ireland with her parents in a motorcycle and sidecar plus dog, and sometimes an aunt. Annie remained close to her parents, caring for them in their final years. She studied geography at Aberystwyth University and travelled in Asia \u2013 embarking on the Magic Bus that started in Totteridge, north London, and made its way across Europe and through Afghanistan. After working in planning she moved into development in social housing with Newlon Housing Association in London. She and I met in 1986 as development workers for Solon East Co-operative Housing Services in Whitechapel, east London, buying and developing land and properties for housing co-operatives to provide homes for their members. In 1990 she moved to the Community Housing Association in Chalk Farm, working there until retirement in 2014. She believed that everybody was entitled to decent housing that they could afford. She was astute in her dealings in the property market, good on design, and always made a difference. Painting was a lifelong love and pastime, and Annie produced powerful and interesting works of art, ranging from sketches of London landscapes, many of them the basis for subsequent paintings, to Cornish seascapes and portraits, including a Windrush series, and drawings and paintings with humanitarian themes. She had a great love of gardens and gardening, too, and obtained a diploma in garden design at Capel Manor College.\nAnnie was a wonderful friend \u2013 kind, patient, interested and very good company. She loved travelling, walking and yoga, and was knowledgable about all sorts of things, but particularly about art, buildings, plants and the environment.

{"title": "Brazilian police kill 25 suspects allegedly part of bank robbery gang", "article": "Police in Brazil have killed 25 suspects as part of what authorities called an unprecedented offensive against heavily armed bank robbers whose brazen heists have brought several major cities to a standstill. The alleged criminals were gunned down in the early hours of Sunday in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, where police claimed they had been poised to unleash an attack. A report in the local O Tempo newspaper said the killings took place at two farmhouses in Varginha, a city about 245 miles (395km) north-west of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis operation \u2026 will go down in history,\u201d the Minas Gerais state security secretary, Rog\u00e9rio Greco, told local radio. The federal highway police, which took part in the mission, said the group had \u201ca veritable military arsenal\u201d including assault rifles, .50-caliber machine guns, explosives and bulletproof vests. Layla Brunella, the spokesperson for Minas Gerais\u2019s military police force, said the alleged robbers belonged to Brazil\u2019s \u201cmodern-day canga\u00e7o\u201d \u2013 a reference to the bands of outlaws who roamed the country\u2019s north-eastern backlands in the early 20th century under the leadership of a highwayman called Lampi\u00e3o. \u201cI can tell you this is the country\u2019s biggest ever operation targeting the \u2018modern-day canga\u00e7o\u2019,\u201d Brunella said. Canga\u00e7o-style gangs have been responsible for a series of raids in Brazil in recent years, often targeting banks in mid-sized cities in the interior of southern and southeastern states. In December 2020, gangsters laid siege to the southern city of Crici\u00fama, torching vehicles, kidnapping government employees, blowing up a bank and engaging in a two-hour gun battle as the mayor implored residents to stay off the streets. In August there was a similar attack in the city of Ara\u00e7atuba in S\u00e3o Paulo state, as black-clad criminals raided banks before fleeing with hostages strapped to the roofs of their getaway vehicles. Police claimed that those killed on Sunday had been plotting a similar assault in the coming days before they were tracked down with the help of intelligence. \u201cMinas Gerais is most certainly not a good place to commit crime,\u201d said Greco, congratulating the security forces for their \u201csensational\u201d actions. Supporters of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, celebrated the shootings in bellicose terms. \u201cToday [the police] carried out a historic clean-up,\u201d tweeted Junio Amaral, a police captain turned congressman who is part of a growing number of security agents catapulted into Brazilian politics by public angst over violent crime. Bolsonaro, a pro-gun populist with significant support in the security forces, was elected in 2018 pledging to use hardline tactics to bring law and order to a country that records tens of thousands of murders each year. Criminals should \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches\u201d, Bolsonaro declared shortly after taking office, calling for legislation that would provide protection from prosecution to security forces and \u201cupstanding citizens\u201d who shot suspects. Last year police killed more than 6,400 people, the overwhelming majority young black men. Almost 200 police officers were killed, a 10% rise compared with the previous year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/31/brazilian-police-kill-suspects-allegedly-part-bank-robbery-gang", "last_update": "2021-10-31T17:13:24Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "In brief: The Secret Royals; Learwife; D: A Tale of Two Worlds \u2013 review", "article": "The Secret Royals Richard J Aldrich and Rory Cormac Atlantic, \u00a325, pp725 The relationship between the royal family and the security services has been a source of speculation and gossip for decades. In their authoritative and gripping account of the intertwined synergy between the two, Richard Aldrich and Rory Cormac present a narrative permeated with intrigue, scandal, and speculation, though it seems a stretch to imagine that the assassination of Rasputin was accomplished with the cooperation of British intelligence. They are stronger on more current matters, and the book ends, fittingly, with a careful but authoritative denunciation of the myriad Diana conspiracy theories. Learwife JR Thorp Canongate, \u00a314.99, pp328 Edward St Aubyn was unsuccessful with his 2017 reinvention of the King Lear story, Dunbar, but JR Thorp\u2019s poetic debut novel explores similar territory in a much more distinctive and compelling manner. Beginning immediately after the play ends, it is told from the perspective of Lear\u2019s middle-aged queen, long exiled to a nunnery. She is forced to come to terms with the humiliations of her femininity in this bleak, masculine world. Thorp\u2019s poignant and surprising narrative allows a character absent from the original play to obtain her long overdue agency. D: A Tale of Two Worlds Michel Faber Black Swan, \u00a38.99, pp291 Michel Faber\u2019s latest novel was published to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the death of Charles Dickens, but it is no cliched \u201cDickensian\u201d fantasia of lovable urchins and curmudgeonly misers. Instead, Faber tells the arresting story of the 13-year-old girl Dhikilo, who discovers that the letter D has been removed from everyday life, before she immerses herself inside a Pullman-esque alternative universe, Gampalonia. The novel\u2019s overarching ambition cannot quite be fulfilled in its relatively short length, but it makes for an entertaining romp nonetheless, with suitably self-aware nods to its progenitor throughout.

{"title": "\u2018The tiger seems to breathe\u2019: Life of Pi comes alive in the West End", "article": "Finn Caldwell is studying four performers perched in the back of a boat. Together, they are manipulating an enormous puppet, the Royal Bengal tiger known as Richard Parker in Life of Pi, Yann Martel\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel, now brought to the stage in a mesmerising production by Max Webster. \u201cHas anyone got a spare hand for a foot?\u201d he asks. There isn\u2019t an easy answer. One of them is holding the creature\u2019s spine. One is swishing its tail and handling its hind legs. A third is moving the animal\u2019s front paws and a fourth \u2013 Habib Nasib Nader, the tiger\u2019s voice \u2013 is keeping the head high and the jaw moving. To coordinate them is a strategic balancing act. Every muscle needs a hand to move it. They are working on the scene where Pi, shipwrecked and adrift between south-east India and Mexico, discovers the ravenous tiger can speak. From the other end of the life raft, the animal reels off a sumptuous litany of dishes: \u201cBoeuf bourguignon, tripe and calf brains in a brown butter jus, roast suckling pig\u2026\u201d With each dish comes a gesture. With each gesture, a finely honed ballet of joints and limbs. Caldwell takes the performers through the speech, phrase by phrase, beat by beat, with exacting detail. \u201cWhen you say, \u2018Stay up,\u2019 are you talking to me specifically?\u201d asks Nader. \u201cNo, the puppet,\u201d says Caldwell. You can understand the confusion. They are four people playing one character and, as movement director, he must make them breathe as one.\n\u201cWhen you operate in a team, you get to the point where you think everybody else\u2019s ideas are better,\u201d Caldwell says. \u201cYou think everyone else is doing it because, somehow, it\u2019s happening between you.\u201d He adds: \u201cOne of the things that feels live about the animal is the audience don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to do \u2013 and the actors don\u2019t know either. Because there are at least three people operating the tiger, the choreography is going to be delivered slightly differently every night. There is this frisson of uncertainty and that makes it very live.\u201d Even here, in this London rehearsal room without lights or costumes, it is impossible to take your eyes off Richard Parker. Designed by Caldwell and Nick Barnes, the tiger is a floating jigsaw of weather-worn joints in sun-blushed orange. He is not real yet he seems to breathe. \u201cYou know it\u2019s some wood, plastic and people, but you invest in it and it happens in your head,\u201d says Caroline Bowman, associate puppet designer, who sculpted most of the show\u2019s many animal heads. \u201cThe more you commit to it, the more beautiful it is.\u201d It is a leap of imagination that pays emotional dividends for the audience. \u201cPeople feel they\u2019ve brought it to life, so they\u2019re responsible for it,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cWhen it hurts, you feel it. When it has joy, you feel it too.\u201d He points to the independent movement of each of the tiger\u2019s joints, secured by bungee rope to the spine, making it elastic and responsive. \u201cAs it rises, you can see one piece going against another,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can really identify the movement. If this was all one thing, half of that movement would be lost. You wouldn\u2019t get the language of the muscle.\u201d Caldwell, who worked with Handspring puppet company on War Horse and partnered with Barnes on The Lorax and Angels in America, describes cats as \u201cstretchy accordions\u201d. By basing the puppets on real animal anatomy, they have built that feline flexibility into Richard Parker: \u201cWhen it jumps it elongates and then it can really compress.\u201d\nIt took a team of eight to build the puppets and a week for the puppeteers to get used to them. The project could have gone badly wrong. On its voyage to the stage, a hallucinatory tale of 227 days at sea could easily have drifted off course. \u201cI had no idea how to do it,\u201d says designer Tim Hatley. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what appealed.\u201d But their efforts have already paid off. On its premiere two years ago at the Crucible in Sheffield, Life of Pi raked in the five-star reviews. Whether it was Hiran Abeysekera\u2019s light-footed performance in the lead role, Lolita Chakrabarti\u2019s theatrically savvy adaptation or Hatley\u2019s magically porous set, everything clicked into place. Had it not been for the pandemic, its West End transfer to Wyndham\u2019s theatre, where they\u2019ve reconfigured the stage to thrust into the stalls, would have come much sooner. \u201cWe got standing ovations even from our roughest preview,\u201d says Caldwell. \u201cBy the fifth time that happened, I thought, regardless of how much work is in front of me, the response from the audience is different from anything I\u2019d seen before.\u201d\nFor director Max Webster, the puppets do two things. First, they appeal to the same childhood instinct that made us turn lollipop sticks into people and bananas into telephones. Second, they connect directly to a key theme in Martel\u2019s book. \u201cWhen theatre becomes hallucinatorily wonderful, it is because you\u2019ve got a group of people collectively imagining a thing, which creates an act of imagination in the audience,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is also what the Pi story is about. Pi tells two stories: a fantastical story, a story with animals, which is the story with puppets \u2013 and a much more scientific story, which is the brutal realism. Pi asks us which story we prefer. The meaning of the story is in the imagination of the puppetry.\u201d Life of Pi is at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, from 15 November", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/31/tiger-life-of-pi-west-end-yann-martel-london", "last_update": "2021-10-31T10:35:41Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Sky calls for climate action from TV firms, despite CEO\u2019s private jet use", "article": "Sky has said broadcasters need to lead by example on the climate crisis \u2013 despite reports that its chief executive was regularly commuting by private jet from her home 3,500 miles away in the US. Sky is one of the main sponsors of the Cop26 climate conference, and as part of an attempt to nudge the general public into taking action against global heating, the broadcaster said television dramas should feature more characters buying electric cars or ordering vegetarian options in restaurants.\nHowever, it has emerged that Sky\u2019s chief executive, Dana Strong, who was appointed in January, was making long-distance trips every few weeks on a private jet from her old base in Philadelphia until she moved to the UK in June, according to the Telegraph. Strong lived close to the headquarters of Sky\u2019s parent company, Comcast, which owns a fleet of corporate aircraft. A spokesperson for Sky defended the private jet commute to the publication, saying: \u201cMany CEOs leading multinational companies have schedules that mean it is appropriate to use different modes of transport.\u201d They added: \u201cIt is critical to counterbalance this, that is why we offset carbon emissions caused by the business travel of Sky employees.\u201d Sky said the company had reduced its carbon footprint by 23% since 2018 and Strong\u2019s travel arrangements were affected by the pandemic as she was unable to move her family to the UK in her first six months as CEO. \u201cDuring this time she balanced visiting her family when her schedule allowed with running the business,\u201d it said. The chief executive\u2019s regular use of a private jet is embarrassing for the company, given that Strong will present guidelines on how the television industry can help change the public\u2019s behaviour on green issues at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Sky hired the behavioural insights team, originally founded as the government\u2019s \u201cnudge unit\u201d, to develop suggestions on how the television industry could help change the public\u2019s behaviour using small encouragements. Their conclusions, shared with the Guardian and which are due to be unveiled by Strong on Monday, propose a series of incidental tweaks to television output \u2013 whether it is drama, children\u2019s programming or news bulletins \u2013 to change the public\u2019s actions. Ironically, one of the report\u2019s findings is that \u201csuch activities will be perceived as more legitimate if broadcasters are seen to lead by example\u201d. The behavioural insights team concluded that viewers were put off \u201cfear-mongering, guilt-tripping, blaming or preaching\u201d and often felt overwhelmed and unable to do anything to help the environment. As a result they recommend television producers put successful individual human actions at the centre of programmes, such as people choosing to take fewer flights. Sky\u2019s guidelines also propose using trusted news presenters to emphasise the importance of the climate crisis, having a consistent message about the need for action on the environment and using the power of large television audiences to put pressure on politicians to act. Some climate activists disagree over whether small changes by large numbers of individuals are enough to halt the onset of global heating. Many are instead emphasising the role played by a small number of enormous corporations and governments in polluting the world. However, the behavioural insights team said over-emphasising looming devastation without offering hope to the public risked \u201calienating the audience\u201d and causing people to nihilistically double down on existing behaviour. They also warn that clumsy, forced environmental storylines can turn off audiences if they make programmes boring, and that the public will not trust television companies that do not also cut their own emissions.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/oct/31/tv-dramas-should-show-characters-fighting-climate-crisis-says-sky", "last_update": "2021-10-31T17:38:52Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Al Franken rules out Senate run against Gillibrand, who led push to remove him", "article": "Al Franken on Sunday ruled out mounting a primary challenge to Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator who four years ago led calls for his resignation as a senator from Minnesota over allegations of sexual misconduct.\nIn a statement to Politico, Franken said: \u201cYes, I miss the Senate but I\u2019m not going to run against Kirsten Gillibrand.\u201d A writer, comedian and former Saturday Night Live cast member, Franken was narrowly elected as a Democrat in Minnesota in 2008 and returned to Washington much more comfortably six years later. He achieved national prominence, particularly as an acerbic critic of Republicans and Donald Trump. His last book before his resignation was titled Al Franken: Giant of the Senate. He was forced to quit in December 2017, amid the first stirrings of the #MeToo movement and over allegations that he touched women inappropriately or forcibly kissed them. Gillibrand led moves to push Franken out, writing: \u201cEnough is enough. As elected officials, we should be held to the highest standards \u2013 not the lowest.\u201d Franken did not face investigation by the Senate ethics committee. In his resignation speech, he said \u201call women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously\u201d but added: \u201cSome of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember differently.\u201d\nHe was replaced in the Senate by Tina Smith, a former lieutenant governor of Minnesota. In 2019, seven serving or retired senators told the New Yorker they regretted forcing Franken out. Franken told the magazine he regretted resigning and added: \u201cI\u2019m angry at my colleagues who did this. I think they were just trying to get past one bad news cycle.\u201d Writing for the Guardian, the academic and feminist author Laura Kipnis said: \u201cI myself thought at the time that if Franken had actually groped women during photo ops, as was alleged, he was right to resign. \u201c\u2026 In late 2017, we were all pretty on edge, I think, combing our pasts for dormant memories of assaults and affronts, and there were so many stories \u2013 too many to make sense of. It was an off-with-their-heads moment, and for a while that felt great. \u201cBut there were also opportunists \u2018telling their truths\u2019. There was failed distinction-making and political expediency, and the impossibility of sorting motives from facts. That\u2019s what\u2019s starting to get unraveled now.\u201d\nAfter moving to New York City, Franken, now 70, has returned to national politics as a commentator, with a podcast and a venture into stand-up comedy, The Only Former US Senator Currently on Tour Tour. Prior to Sunday, he had done little to scotch rumours of a political comeback. Politico quoted an anonymous source as saying Gillibrand, New York\u2019s junior senator since 2009 and a failed candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, had been \u201cnot exactly cool as a cucumber about\u201d a possible challenge from Franken. Gillibrand\u2019s chief of staff, Jess Fassler, told the website: \u201cThe only thing she\u2019s worried about right now is getting family leave into the Build Back Better package.\u201d In his statement to Politico, Franken only ruled out a run against Gillibrand.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/31/al-franken-rules-out-run-against-kirsten-gillibrand", "last_update": "2021-10-31T16:22:13Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Morrison government climate plan will fail if solely reliant on technology, thinktank reports", "article": "The Morrison government has been warned its plan for carbon neutrality by 2050 will fail if it is solely reliant on investing in new technology. The Grattan Institute\u2019s Towards Net Zero report, released on Monday, has suggested the Australian government would need to pull many other policy levers to reach net zero, including vehicle emissions standards, energy efficiency obligations and rules on use of carbon credits. The report\u2019s lead author, Tony Wood, suggested that the Morrison government\u2019s net zero plan, announced on Tuesday, failed to show how emissions reduction would be achieved outside the electricity sector. Scott Morrison will attend the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow from Monday without an increased 2030 emissions reduction target, despite international pressure from the UK, EU, US and Pacific island nations to significantly increase ambition.\nThe Pacific Islands Association of Non-governmental Organisations has urged \u201crich\u201d nations to \u201cmove significantly faster to reduce global emissions by 2030\u201d in order to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. They have warned that heating beyond that would be \u201cdevastating for our region and some of our countries in the Pacific would be under the ocean\u201d. It urged that developed nations phase out fossil fuel production, which Australia has opposed at the G20, leading into Cop26. The Grattan report noted that while Australia was on track to beat its 26 to 28% 2030 emissions reduction target, more must be done today to reach the 2050 goal. It proposed expanding the emissions reduction fund (ERF) and limits on big emitters in the safeguard mechanism, investment in the electricity grid, and rules around carbon credits to help build a market for them. Under the Morrison government plan, $20bn will be spent over the next decade investing in technology including an extra $2bn of emissions reductions bought through the ERF. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has suggested similar investments would be needed by future governments in coming decades but declined to nominate a total cost.\nBut the Grattan report warned that in the medium to longer term \u201csuch funding from governments will be unsustainable and regulation should have a limited but valuable role\u201d. \u201cMore ambitious emissions reductions targets are likely to be required.\u201d Wood told Guardian Australia the Morrison government plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t get you towards net zero by 2050\u201d. \u201cThe assumption in Morrison\u2019s thinking \u2026 is that all you have to do is spend money on the technology then it becomes cheap enough to be adopted. In some cases it is, but in many cases it\u2019s not.\u201d\nWood cited carbon capture and storage and use of green hydrogen with renewables as processes that \u201ccost more\u201d, a \u201cgreen premium\u201d that would have to be paid through a carbon price, whether direct or indirect, such as Australia\u2019s current subsidies. The Grattan report noted that over the next decade electricity emissions are projected to fall substantially, but the next four largest emissions sources in Australia will either grow or plateau at best.\nWood said with an estimated cost of $20 a tonne to reduce emissions there was \u201cno way known\u201d the government could expand subsidies to cut 500m tonnes a year to reach net zero, it is \u201cbeyond comprehension\u201d. \u201cThe better way is to have industry do it, because they\u2019ll find cheaper ways to do it than the government will \u2026 I don\u2019t have problem with the ERF but, like the technology plan, it\u2019s not enough.\u201d The report argued the first step should be to stop subsidising developments that will increase future emissions, citing the Beetaloo Basin and Carmichael coalmine as two sources that should not be supported by taxpayer funds. In addition to investing in technology, the government will also need to actively discourage high-emissions technologies and if necessary, disallow them. Wood said helping these projects is like putting \u201cyour foot on accelerator and your other foot on the brake\u201d, arguing there is \u201cno justification\u201d for subsidising a \u201cstraightforward commercial project\u201d like the Beetaloo Basin gas development.

Ahead of the United Nations-led climate summit in Glasgow, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is the host of the gathering, has urged leaders to come with serious commitments. On Saturday the UK government\u2019s climate change adviser launched a scathing attack on Australia\u2019s net zero commitment. The Climate Change Committee chair, Lord Deben, told the BBC there was \u201cno indication\u201d that Morrison had a plan to deliver on the commitment to net zero that was \u201csqueezed out of him\u201d.

{"title": "Climate change has driven farmers to despair and in return we get callous disregard | Sophie Love", "article": "My husband has left the farm we have worked so hard on since 2007. He says, \u201cI can\u2019t do it any more.\u201d He needs time to rest and heal. I don\u2019t know what that means for my marriage or if I can run this farm alone. Will he want to sell the only stable home I have ever known \u2013 my heart\u2019s rest, my lifelong dream and the oasis I bought as a single 40-year-old? My husband has worked away most weeks, roaming across New South Wales for our solar business, so we have been cramming seven days of farm work into two at the weekends. We are just one of thousands of small-scale farmers growing beef for the domestic market, artisanal alpaca yarn for crafters, honey for local shops and small goods made from our garlic, honey and chillies. Our main farm income is from the farm stay \u2013 reconnecting city folk with country, river, platypus and free-range happy herds.\nThe drought crept up on us \u2013 ground getting harder, air dryer. Predicted rains in August 2019 never came and by then it was too late. Cattle lost condition overnight in September despite hand feeding and then they started falling like flies. There\u2019s a special kind of stress when a beloved cow goes down and can\u2019t get up. Propping them up on their knees so they can rest and digest, carrying feed and water, and hoping for a miracle. The river stopped flowing. Birds were silent, dust swirled. The water level in the pools dropped by inches each day as the sun burned bleakly in an unrelenting blue. My 11-year-old and I spent hours trying to dig a cow out of a bog and feed her distressed calf. I got used to turning downer cows by rolling them with sheer force of will. I washed a million maggots off that bogged cow when we finally got her free and up. She didn\u2019t make it. So many of my friends, whom I have raised by hand with love and laughter, lay down and died. We had to sell what we could rather than watch them die too. For pennies. The herd we had spent 12 years growing organically, year on year from our foundation cow, Daisy, was decimated. Then came the fires, roaring towards us like a freight train. The air was filled with smoke for months. Some days you could barely see 50 metres in front of you. We were choking on our fears, tears, smoke and dust. Our once lush pastures were dry and bare; all of us haunted, hungry, lean, bewildered. The farm stay closed for lack of water, smoke and dust. Feed prices escalated while income dwindled. The sky was orange as if the end of the world was nigh. And finally our day of reckoning in the wrath of flame arrived. We were lucky \u2013 we had two days to prepare. Putting sprinklers on every building, water tank, using precious drops profligately to avert disaster. And then we left, as friends pitched in to remove our most precious possessions.\nWe returned to find bush and paddocks on fire but infrastructure safe. Our fear of a crown fire reprieved by a wind change. Then our lactating, much-beloved bitch went missing when the puppies were three weeks old. My son\u2019s dog, his all-consuming love. There was no room in our hearts for that grief. I still don\u2019t think we have even started to process the loss of Goldie. The air was thick with the sweet stench of rotting flesh and pregnant with dust. It was so thick, you could taste it. When it drizzled on Christmas Day, it was the miracle we all needed. Yes, we had been beleaguered and embattled but we would soldier on. That\u2019s when the first news of disquiet trickled out of Wuhan and the long discussions with my British parents about whether to cancel their longed-for last ever trip to Australia began (they are in their 80s). Pandemic stress is a different form of helplessness. With my husband travelling all the time, his fear of bringing home Covid was palpable. Finances became even leaner as my son and I locked down. And then came the floods. We\u2019ve lived through major floods before of course. But no one has ever seen anything like this. In the final peak, the river rose by 3 metres in 45 minutes \u2013 searing into our memories as we scurried to save what we could. I scoured the internet for pipes and a 45-tonne excavator to complement our little 15-tonner. We rebuilt our access bridge after weeks of wading through creek, belongings held aloft, and kayaking across raging torrents with diesel and supplies. There\u2019s a human cost to climate change. It has a worn face \u2013 lined from squinting into sunshine and runnelled with grief from weary eyes. And not from just the disasters, but also the creeping heat on the thermometer on the veranda. The wild storms, the tornados, the dry lightning strikes sparking fire or murdering solar power systems. Insurance premiums keep rising and damage from one disaster is still outstanding when the next hits, compounding grief upon grief, stress upon stress, fear upon fear.\nYou would think that the climate crisis and the world\u2019s call for action is some sort of joke when you see the bonhomie and game playing by the government. Clearly they have never evacuated their home in terror, watched everything they love wither, stooped to start again with broken hearts and aching backs. They are playing with our lives, with our future, with our children\u2019s homes. Depression is treatable but the despair caused by their callous disregard for the real impact of their hubris can only be cured by a change of government, a change of heart. \u2022 Sophie Love is a first-generation farmer.

{"title": "Run to paradise: how the sound of travel is evolving in Australia", "article": "I was recently sitting in a hotel lobby listening to Spotify and I was surprised to find myself almost in tears. Not because it was music that got me there: the right song has always been able to move me. But because of what the music was: erm, the Qantas soundtrack. It was those two 15-minute orchestrated pieces heard perhaps millions of times by travellers boarding and disembarking Australia\u2019s national carrier. It was a surprise. Too little sleep, I wondered, or the ghost of travel past? For those of us who relied upon travel for work and to connect with family and friends, these past two years have been a tough adjustment. I\u2019d always pigeonholed travel soundtracks as background music, when really they are often thoughtful sound design \u2013 composed or curated to be functional, whether to calm us, tap emotions, or connect us to a brand.\nStephanie Tully, chief customer officer at Qantas, says the release of their soundtrack to Spotify and Apple Music is a response to customers who told the airline they miss flying as much as getting to the destination. \u201cAnd this sensory experience will help fill the temporary void while some of us can\u2019t fly because of border closures,\u201d Tully says. The music was commissioned specifically for the airline and was composed by Haydn Walker from Sydney sound design studio Song Zu. \u201cThey wanted [the soundtrack] to be some sort of journey, to have a contour to it, an arc,\u201d Walker told Song Zu\u2019s Spotlight podcast. The track was aimed at relaxing passengers, and Walker says Qantas wanted it to \u201cfeel Australian\u201d, echoing much of the music the airline had previously played on board. Australian vocalist and guitarist Dylan Wright helped to create a sense of modern Australia, Walker says. \u201cSuch a beautiful voice \u2013 one of my favourite falsettos but kind of current sounding.\u201d But the music choices the airline makes are not without controversy. Qantas decided to remove music programming from their inflight entertainment portfolio in 2018 due to a lack of usage. In response, Dean Ormston, the chief executive of Australian music copyright organisation Apra Amcos, tweeted that a \u201clack lustre curation of music focused audio/video could be the cause\u201d of flyers\u2019 disinterest. He also urged the carrier to take \u201cAussie music to the world\u201d.\nWhile airlines like Qantas employ the talents of composers like Walker, there are those who scour the existing canon of modern music to stitch together soundscapes with, say, hotel design. Andrew Lewis is a DJ turned music curator who works with hotel brands like Ovolo and QT. \u201cYou have this beautifully designed hotel so the sense of sight is handled, and then to have the music be your sense of sound \u2013 it\u2019s another touchpoint that you can really capture people with,\u201d Lewis says. To help his process, Lewis spends time in the hotels and understands what they are trying to achieve through design, art curation, furniture and the space itself. He also considers a hotel\u2019s food and drinks offering, as in recent years Australian hotels have become a destination for dining as well as sleeping.\n\u201cGold Coast [QT] is different from the music in Sydney and it\u2019s different from the music in Perth and so on,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cGold Coast is kind of beachy and laidback, so there\u2019s big tunes in there. Sydney is more hustle bustle, so there\u2019s a little bit more up-tempo music.\u201d Lewis was responsible for the music at Santini Bar and Grill at QT Perth, working with former executive chef Nic Wood and New York-based Australian restaurateur Robert Marchetti. \u201cWe went with the Italian crooners and this old school sexy steakhouse vibe and it works really well,\u201d Lewis says of the bold dining room. \u201cIt could come off really cheesy and weird but the fact that it\u2019s over styled, the music can kind of be a little cheesy.\u201d\nLewis creates music schedules. Typically breakfast music will take guests from 6am until noon, then there\u2019s noon until 3pm, and so on. \u201cI break the music up into tempos,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll break it up into 100 beats per minute and under, then keep that from about 5pm to 6 or 7pm, and then increase the tempo as the night goes on.\u201d The ultimate in background soundtracks is perhaps elevator music. And Lewis\u2019s sound design at QT Sydney and Melbourne extends to these brief interludes between floors, with sensors in the ceilings changing the music according to the number of people riding. \u201cWith one person we might play All by Myself, with two it would be something like Just The Two of Us, and then party tunes after that.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/nov/01/run-to-paradise-how-the-sound-of-travel-is-evolving-in-australia", "last_update": "2021-10-28T05:09:41Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Clementine Ford pivots to love: \u2018For how long can you be the provocative feminist voice?\u2019", "article": "When I mentioned to a friend that I was going to be interviewing Clementine Ford, she said she was curious to read Ford\u2019s new book, How We Love: \u201cI want to hear about love from someone who has known so much hate.\u201d I tell Ford this when we connect over Zoom late one Friday afternoon, Ford sat on her sofa in the plant-filled Melbourne home she shares with her young son. Her face lights up with the writer\u2019s appreciation of a neat turn of phrase and the long-time self-promoter\u2019s awareness of something she can use. \u201cThat\u2019s a great line! I might borrow that. I love that.\u201d It is no wonder that Ford \u2013 writer, podcaster, self-described \u201csassy social media bigmouth\u201d, \u201cHardline Feminist\u201d per the Daily Mail and \u201cHYSTERICAL FEMALE\u201d per her T-shirt today \u2013 is attuned to ways to describe herself. She has spent nearly a decade embroiled in highly public controversies, most of them attempts to silence her no-holds-barred brand of popular feminism \u2013 and some, she allows, of her own making. As the feminist academic Anita Brady recently wrote: \u201cIn Australian media culture, it is difficult to imagine a figure more visible as a vector of popular misogyny than Clementine Ford.\u201d Ford seems to have a particular ability to provoke, flushing out sexism where it might otherwise go unstated \u2013 but also dividing progressives with her attention-grabbing approach and occasional misfires. Out-and-proud \u201canti-feminists\u201d, meanwhile, Ford whips into a frenzy. In 2017, having cemented her position in the public sphere with her first book, Fight Like a Girl, Milo Yiannopoulos performed his disgust of Ford to live audiences throughout Australia, and millions more online. All of it, praising or scathing, amounts to make Ford arguably the most famous feminist in Australia, whose celebrity, Brady argues, \u201cis indistinguishable from the work of her feminism\u201d \u2013 and often in response to misogynistic attacks.\nJulia Baird described the bestselling Fight Like A Girl as having \u201cbeen shaped in combat\u201d; after spending almost her entire 30s what might be termed \u201cfeministing\u201d in public, the same could be said of Ford herself. \u201cPeople always assume that I\u2019m coming from a place of anger and hate,\u201d says Ford, now 40. How We Love represents Ford\u2019s attempt to change that narrative \u2013 or at least enlarge it. \u201cAs much as I am quite impervious, now, to people\u2019s opinions of me, I also feel the same human instinct and need to be understood, which is what so much of the book is about: to be loved, to be known, to be seen,\u201d she says. \u201cFor much of my career, I have felt very misunderstood \u2013 and wilfully, in many cases.\u201d Now Ford is making a gentle request for understanding: \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to go easy on me. I\u2019m just asking you not to reduce me to a stereotype.\u201d The memoir is in the style of the British writer Dolly Alderton\u2019s hugely successful Everything I Know About Love, focusing on the most meaningful relationships of Ford\u2019s life, starting with her family. Born in Queensland, Ford grew up between Oman, rural England, Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 and \u201cuncool in each of these places\u201d, she writes. She describes herself as \u201ca theatre kid at heart\u201d, chronically performative as only the youngest of three can be. Ford\u2019s father, an Australian, met her Guyanese mother while she was working in an English pub. How We Love opens with her mother\u2019s harrowing death from cancer at age 58, having refused further treatment, and concludes with Ford becoming a mother herself. Compared with the \u201cmanifesto\u201d Fight Like a Girl (which has been optioned for TV) and the 2018 follow-up Boys Will Be Boys (a takedown of the patriarchy and toxic masculinity), How We Love is strikingly devoid of politics and reveals a surprisingly softer, more self-doubting side to Ford.\nThat was the point, she says \u2013 to ground her activism in \u201ca place of love for men\u201d, of wanting them and the world to be better. (I see this in the boundless patience she shows her son in his frequent interjections through our interview; and in her respectful exchange with her father when he stood for One Nation in 2017.) Far from a departure from her political work, Ford sees How We Love as \u201ca natural companion\u201d. But she had a personal motivation for writing it, too. After her challenging pregnancy and childbirth, the furore over the \u201cman-hating\u201d Boys Will Be Boys, and the breakdown of her relationship with her son\u2019s father, Ford says she was on track for a mental health crisis if she continued on her highly public, combative path. \u201cIt is quite bruising, being in a space all the time where you feel like you\u2019re constantly primed against attack.\u201d Where once Ford spoiled for the fight (\u201cI really did get off on it a little bit ... that provocative youthful energy\u201d), motherhood changed her. \u201cIt exposed a soft underbelly that I didn\u2019t necessarily realise was there \u2026 and part of becoming a softer person is being willing to be more vulnerable in front of people.\u201d Pitching the idea for How We Love in mid-2019, Ford told her publisher she wanted her next book to be one requiring no research, that would be \u201creally nice to write\u201d. It was also somewhat strategic. For some time, Ford has been conscious of a ceiling to her potential progression as a mainstream feminist voice \u2013 \u201cbecause I never gave an out to the men who run the show,\u201d she says. In 2019, Ford quit her long-running column for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, claiming that she had previously been disciplined for tweeting that prime minister Scott Morrison was a \u201cfucking disgrace\u201d. Television producers have told her that she has been knocked back for various projects for being \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d, she says.\nFord paints a picture of having been backed into an increasingly tight corner: expected to \u201calways write something angry\u201d, but not so angry as to actually threaten the status quo. But even people who agree with Ford\u2019s politics may disagree with her tactics: always straight-shooting, often oppositional, occasionally artless \u2013 and even arguably counterproductive. In May 2020 Ford shared vile abuse sent to her by a teenage boy alongside his name and photo with her tens of thousands of Instagram followers (she removed the post in response to pleas from the boy\u2019s mother). That same month, she tweeted that the coronavirus \u201cwasn\u2019t killing men fast enough\u201d: a misjudged mic-drop concluding comments about the increased domestic burden on women through the pandemic. Ironic misandry is par for the course on Twitter \u2013 what Ford now regards as \u201ccompletely toxic\u201d and \u201cnot a healthy place for me to be\u201d \u2013 but predictably inflammatory beyond it. After tweeting on Saturday afternoon, Ford doubled down on Saturday evening, apologised Sunday morning, and now rarely tweets.\nIt was \u201can own goal\u201d, she says. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated for having written it, in part because now anyone who wants to disagree with anything just sends that tweet right back to me.\u201d In among the genuine distress, she says, there were some \u2013 notably News Corp columnists \u2013 simply \u201cgleeful\u201d for the chance to lambast her. She only felt moved to apologise after a Black woman in the US told her that, there, Black and brown men were overrepresented among Covid-19 death rate: \u201cI was still operating in a theoretical space in which men were in a position of power.\u201d It was not the first time that Ford has been criticised for perpetuating feminism as a concern of middle-class, cis white women. She volunteers now that she has historically \u201cperpetuated racist rhetoric, as a white person who lives with white privilege\u201d. She likens this to the ways men benefit from structural sexism simply by being men. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to say \u2018Well, I\u2019m not the enemy, I\u2019m not a misogynist.\u2019 You may not be actively doing these things, but you benefit from a system that privileges you.\u201d In recent times Ford has made an obvious effort to share her platforms with those who are not so readily afforded them. \u201cOne of the problems is we\u2019ve always siloed voices,\u201d she says of feminism. \u201cNot only has that denied other people the right and the privilege of being heard, but it also places an enormous amount of pressure on the one voice who, for whatever reasons, gets to be chosen.\u201d How We Love, Ford agrees, is at least in part a strategic attempt to become \u201cmore well-rounded\u201d and diversify her offering. \u201cThere must have been a part of me that thought: for how long can you be the provocative feminist voice? And if that\u2019s the only thing that you do \u2013 at what point does that begin to actually be the performance that everyone says that it is? \u201cI never want to be palatable. But professionally and pragmatically, I\u2019m trying to improve my options.\u201d If Ford had been feeling unsure about her future direction, the pandemic forced her to act. She started a podcast called Big Sister Hotline, a weekly \u201cgas bag\u201d on Instagram Live, and influencing for a sex toy company (use \u201cCLEMFORD\u201d for 20% off). Ford also receives donations through her Patreon page, supporting her \u201cfeminist critique, comedy and unassailable truths\u201d \u2013 lately, rallying against anti-vaxxers.\nThe pivot makes explicit the argument of Brady, the academic: that Ford\u2019s \u201ccelebrity is both the product and the site of her feminist work\u201d, presenting visibility of feminism as an end, not a means, on platforms that are \u201csafely affirmative\u201d.\nIf she was once considered a radical feminist voice \u2013 if only by virtue of being \u201cfoulmouthed\u201d (to quote from her Twitter bio) in well-mannered spaces \u2013 Ford may now more closely resemble a girlboss: a woman making feminism work for her, through the neoliberal logic of self-empowerment. It\u2019s a charge Ford engages with admirably. \u201cObviously there\u2019s massive problems with the way that feminism has jumped into bed with capitalism, and I\u2019m certainly guilty of being part of that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think [that critique] is important. But once again, it seems to be directed away from the richest, most privileged people in the world: largely, white men.\u201d When people fighting for social justice feel unable to influence those in power, Ford suggests, \u201cit can feel more effective to throw your tomatoes at the people they\u2019re going to hit\u201d. Some of those lobbed at her have been \u201cvery fairly thrown, and landed as they should,\u201d she says. But now Ford wants to get out of the firing line. It is not that she is reinventing herself, or running away, Ford says. \u201cI just want the opportunities to tell stories that make people feel things \u2013 not just angry.\u201d \u2022 How We Love by Clementine Ford is out 2 November through Allen & Unwin (RRP$29.99)", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/01/clementine-ford-pivots-to-love-for-how-long-can-you-be-the-provocative-feminist-voice", "last_update": "2021-10-29T11:22:23Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018Time can break your heart\u2019: the harsh toll of eight years in Australian immigration detention", "article": "\u201cTime can bring you down,\u201d Adnan Choopani sings, his words echoing off the walls of the detention centre compound, \u201ctime can bend your knees\u201d. Time is something Adnan, and his cousin Mehdi, know only too well. For eight years they have been held by Australia\u2019s immigration detention regime, offshore and on.\nThey have watched friends burn themselves to death and known the despair that has led them to attempt suicide themselves. They have been beaten and abused, jailed without reason. They have grown from boys into men in that time. Fifteen and 16 when they arrived in Australia seeking sanctuary, they are now 23. Despite their claims for protection being formally recognised more than half a decade ago, they remain in detention. Shunted from confinement to confinement, often without notice, they have watched friends being released, to start new lives in Australia and overseas, but have seen others succumb to medical neglect or suicide. Self-taught during their long hours of detention, they play Eric Clapton\u2019s Tears in Heaven, they say, in memory of those they have lost over their years of incarceration.\n\u201cTime,\u201d Adnan sings, \u201ccan break your heart, have you begging please.\u201d From detention, Adnan says quietly: \u201cI\u2019ve lost so many of my friends. \u201cPeople who never thought they would kill themselves. I never thought they would kill themselves. But unfortunately they did. They left us and they are gone.\n\u201cThe closest people to me, they\u2019ve been so close to death, I\u2019ve been so close to death \u2013 it is a miracle I have survived. So Tears in Heaven is like my situation, of losing people, being left behind.\u201d Mehdi \u2013 he uses only one name - and Adnan were teenagers when their families urged them to flee Iran, where they faced systemic oppression as members of the Ahwazi Arab minority. The cousins, who had known each other in childhood but did not live near each other, left their country independently, travelling to Indonesia. By extraordinary coincidence, they found themselves thrust by people smugglers onto the same overloaded fishing boat bound for Australia.\nThe pair have barely been apart since. After four days at sea, their boat was intercepted by the Australian navy and escorted to Christmas Island, where they disembarked, initially euphoric at having survived. They were given boat IDs - ANA020 for Mehdi, ANA023 for Adnan \u2013 the dehumanising appellations they would carry for years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLess than an hour after setting foot on Australian soil, they were told they could not stay. While their vessel was at sea, the then prime minister Kevin Rudd had announced that all boat-borne asylum seekers would be sent offshore and would never be allowed to settle in Australia. The boys spent nine months in Christmas Island\u2019s detention centre. There, Mehdi was judged to be a child, but Adnan, a bare handful of months older, was found to be an adult (the age determination methods used by Australia have since been discredited). \u2018It really took its toll\u2019 In 2014, Mehdi and Adnan were transferred to Nauru and Adnan was now recognised as a child. The pair were housed together in the family camp, and allowed to attend the detention centre school, a modest but vital enterprise, later shut down by the Australian government. Gabby Sutherland taught the boys on the island. She found them both polite and respectful, keen to learn but bewildered by the system that held them. She connected with them, Mehdi especially, over art. \u201cHe liked intellectual conversations, philosophy, art and music. Mehdi is a gentle soul, he was quite protective. If anything ever happened to any of the teachers, or the people that he cared about, he was always very concerned.\u201d She and Mehdi still talk about art, and their work \u2013 inspired and influenced by each other \u2013 hangs side by side in the Sonder gallery in Cooroy, Queensland, of which Sutherland is a founding director.\nOn Nauru, Mehdi and Adnan were held in regional processing centre three (RPC3), a motley collection of tents pitched on gravel and that grew mouldy in the heat. Late in 2014, their claim for refugee protection was formally recognised. They had a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d in their home country, and could not legally be returned there. Australia was legally obliged to protect them. It made no difference to their situation. The Nauru Files, internal working documents from the Nauru detention centre published in the Guardian in 2016, revealed widespread abuse of children in detention. Children were sexually assaulted, beaten, abused and suffered catastrophic mental health effects, leading to depression, suicide attempts and the rarely-seen resignation syndrome. \u201cFor the children in the camp, there was massive deterioration in their mental health over time,\u201d Sutherland says. \u201cTheir happiness, their ability to function, there was the inevitable vicarious trauma that the children took on after listening to people screaming all night, people self-harming, sewing their lips together. It really took its toll on the kids, it was visible, you could see it, day by day.\u201d Life outside the wire held little promise of anything better. A guard paid to protect them threatened Mehdi that if he was ever released from detention \u201cI will kill you in Nauru\u201d.\nIn October 2014, the 29 unaccompanied minors were released from detention and placed in accommodation on the island. They were not safe. The Guardian reported that four boys were beaten and robbed that month \u2013 one left unconscious. \u201cThey started swearing,\u201d one of the children attacked reported, \u201cthey said \u2018all mother-fucker refugees, we will kill you, this is our country and no one can protect you\u2019\u201d. The next month, a threatening letter was dropped at the houses of all resettled refugees. When Adnan sewed his lips together in protest at his treatment and sat down outside the settlement services building on the island, he and Mehdi \u2013 who had sat down to support him \u2013 were thrown in jail, justified by Nauru police as contravening a new law outlawing protests. Handcuffed and stripped naked, they were thrown into a prison cell where they were abused, spat on and beaten by another prisoner. Neither was ever charged. In a separate incident, Adnan was beaten by a man who mistakenly thought he had been involved in a road accident. Exposed and uncertain, Mehdi and Adnan suffered. Their mental health collapsed. \u2018Every day we struggle to survive\u2019 In 2019, they were brought to Australia under the short-lived medevac laws, which gave doctors, rather than government officials, the final determination on where a patient was treated. Dozens of their fellow medevac arrivals are now living in the Australian community but Mehdi and Adnan have not been freed, instead shunted between detention centres and guarded hotel rooms commandeered by the government and designated as \u201calternative places of detention\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been a complete trauma,\u201d Mehdi says. \u201cWe came as children, we were boys, and we never had a childhood, we were just put in a cage. We did not receive a proper education, we were never allowed to have fun, we just had to try to survive in these harsh circumstances. \u201cThere\u2019s not many choices we have had in our life. It\u2019s not like we choose to be strong \u2013 we had to be if we wanted to survive.\u201d\nAdnan says he despairs at the years he has spent confined. \u201cEvery day is still uncertain, that is the way they punish us. Every day we struggle to survive. They are going to leave us almost a decade with no update, no date of release, no charges, no nothing, it\u2019s completely mental torture.\u201d After initially being rejected for resettlement in the US during the Trump administration, Mehdi was this year accepted under the Australia-US refugee swap deal, but Adnan was not. Mehdi faced the invidious choice of potentially having to accept his freedom and leave his cousin behind. Last week, after months of uncertainty that damaged his mental health and led to another suicide attempt, Adnan was told he was also eligible to go to the US. But there is still no date for when it will happen, and no guarantee it ever will. Detention continues meanwhile, with new indignities heaped upon them.\nA month ago, Mehdi and Adnan were forced into handcuffs, marched onto a government charter flight by Serco guards with other detainees and flown to Melbourne for medical checks. \u201cThere were 30 guards on the flight,\u201d Mehdi said. \u201cThey treated us as criminals, I said \u2018shame on you, you are treating me like a criminal. I have done nothing wrong. I am a refugee, you are supposed to protect\u2019.\u201d After two weeks in hotel quarantine, they were given medical checks for potential resettlement in the US. Since then, they have been held in a Melbourne detention centre, waiting for news. The department of home affairs declined to answer specific questions about Mehdi and Adnan\u2019s ongoing detention. The department said to maintain a \u201cstrong border protection approach\u201d, asylum seekers who arrive by boat would not be allowed to settle permanently. \u201cTransitory persons brought temporarily to Australia from a regional processing country remain subject to current regional processing arrangements... [and] are expected to return to a regional processing country, engage in third country migration outcomes or depart for a third country.\u201d Confined by a detention indefinite and unpredictable, Mehdi feels his physical health deteriorating. His medication regimen has been interrupted, and his teeth cause him intense pain. Daily, he feels his mental health wearing too. He watches other detainees walk out the gates for lives in Australia, or to board planes bound for new lives overseas. \u201cI am definitely happy for them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is hard to still be here, left behind. I don\u2019t wish this for my worst enemy. But I wish for myself freedom. All I can tell you, the last eight years is just survival, up and down, down and up, trying to survive. \u201cRight now, I just want to take a walk in the street, I just want a simple, naive life, but a life that is mine, that is free.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

{"title": "Australian defence force strengthens vetting procedures to prevent extremists from joining", "article": "The Australian defence force has tightened its vetting procedures in a bid to prevent nationalist and racist violent extremists from joining. The measures, which include better information sharing with the intelligence agency Asio, are driven by concerns that extremists have sought to join the ADF \u201cto obtain training and capability\u201d.\nA defence spokesperson told Guardian Australia the organisation: \u201cWorks closely with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to understand and mitigate the threat of ideologically motivated extremism to Defence and within Defence.\u201d The spokesperson said the new framework \u201cimproves upon existing information exchange arrangements between Defence and Asio to assess whether someone is a \u2018fit and proper person\u2019 to serve.\u201d They said questions are asked \u201cto determine whether someone is a \u2018fit and proper person\u2019 to serve, which includes a national criminal check and psychological screening of all candidates.\u201d \u201cIn addition, candidates are questioned on their understanding of the meaning and application of Defence values.\u201d Defence would not comment on the scale of the problem of extremists seeking to join the ADF, including how many individuals may have already been turned away as a result of the updated process. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut Asio disclosed that it had been receiving referrals under a new framework, which it said was introduced in May this year. \u201cSome nationalist and racist violent extremists seek to join the Australian Defence Force to obtain training and capability,\u201d Asio said in its newly published annual report. \u201cAsio and Defence have worked closely to ensure Asio security assessment processes can be applied proactively to these individuals.\u201d The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, has previously expressed concerns about the issue, telling 60 Minutes some neo-Nazis were \u201cabsolutely\u201d attempting to join the ADF by concealing their views when recruited.\n\u201cThey can mask that, carry through, get well-trained,\u201d Burgess told Nine in August. \u201cAnd when they leave, they\u2019re improved. And that is a concern if they then use that to train others or go to acts of violence themselves.\u201d The improved screening measures stem from government regulations that set out how a person can be enlisted or appointed in the ADF. Beforehand, the regulations say, defence is required to consider \u201cwhether the person is a fit and proper person to perform duties as such an officer or enlisted member\u201d.\nIn addition, all personnel who apply for an Australian government security clearance face a process that includes an evaluation of risk factors, including \u201cexternal loyalties, influences and associations\u201d. Asio now classifies rightwing extremists, including white supremacists and neo-Nazis, under the umbrella category of ideologically motivated violent extremists. The agency said this category now accounts for about 50% of its priority onshore counter-terrorism caseload, with the remainder being religiously motivated violent extremism. Asio has expressed concerns about the growing number of young men who are being radicalised by violent ideologies \u2013 one of the issues being investigated by a parliamentary inquiry into extremist movements in Australia. \u201cThere has been considerable and understandable attention given to nationalist and racist violent extremism,\u201d Burgess told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday. \u201cBut we are also seeing growth in single-issue motivated groups and individuals that have the potential to embrace violence.

{"title": "\u2018There could be snakes\u2019: planes mothballed by Covid prepare to fly again", "article": "In the red dust of the Australian desert, more than a hundred shiny planes are lined up nose to tail, an aviation long-term parking lot. Hundreds more form geometric patterns in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, where engineers whack the wheel hubs of Qantas A380s to scare off rattlesnakes. When Covid forced the world to stop, planes were herded into enormous storage areas across the United States, Europe, and just outside of Alice Springs, Australia. And now it\u2019s time to rip off the plastic, power up the engines, and prepare for takeoff once more.\nA week ago Qantas chief Alan Joyce stood in front of a 787 and talked about the \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d as vaccination rates rise and borders open. He announced old routes would start up again, and new routes would join them. The first Qantas A380 will arrive in Australia on Christmas Day, he said, and a second will be in place by April. Only three months ago they were planning to keep them in the desert for longer, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how fast things are moving and how optimistic we are to meet the demand, that we\u2019re bringing two of them forward \u2026 one of them before Christmas, one for training and crew.\u201d Many Qantas planes are in California, while Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage near Alice Springs is a temporary home for planes owned by Jetstar, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Tigerair and more. Apas had to keep expanding as the pandemic mothballed more planes, and opened a second site in Queensland. University of New South Wales aerospace design senior lecturer Dr Sonya Brown explains that while the craft are in hibernation, engineers work hard to stop encroaching wildlife and rust. Ports and openings must be sealed, and the oil drained and replaced with a preservative oil \u2013 a process called \u201cpickling\u201d. Then there is a raft of procedures to get them safely airborne again.\nEarlier this year the European Union Aviation Safety Agency warned of an \u201calarming trend in the number of reports of unreliable speed and altitude indications during the first flight(s) following the aircraft leaving storage, caused by contaminated air data systems\u201d. Planes were forced to halt takeoffs or turn back because of \u201cforeign objects\u201d such as insect nests in pitot static systems, pressure-sensitive equipment which provides critical air data information such as airspeed. \u201cWildlife intrusion is certainly one of the big things with storage \u2013 insects and bird nests,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThere are a lot of visual checks for animals and the like.\n\u201cInsects can get into air data lines \u2013 they\u2019re a particular concern because they\u2019re what help the aircraft understand how high they are, how fast they\u2019re going. You have to flush them with nitrogen to make sure they\u2019re fully clear. \u201cAnd there could be snakes, more likely around the landing gear.\u201d June was rattlesnake season in the Californian desert and Qantas engineering manager Tim Heywood says the team came up with a \u201cwheel whacker\u201d for each aircraft. \u201cThe area is well known for its feisty \u2018rattlers\u2019 who love to curl up around the warm rubber tyres and in the aircraft wheels and brakes,\u201d he says, so maintenance crew stomp their feet and whack the wheels to scare them off. (The critical \u201cwheel whacker\u201d, part of the engineering kit, is a repurposed broom handle.) Brown says planes are stored in arid areas, away from humidity. Any openings are sealed, parts get wrapped in plastic, while those insects and birds get turfed. The engines are powered up regularly, and the wheels are rotated so they don\u2019t get flat spots. Those that have to be left in metropolitan airports like Sydney, where many staff are still based, might have the air conditioner run to clear out the moisture. Airbus recommends that planes are parked on a flat surface with the nose pointing into the wind to limit the effect of wind gusts. In some cases chocks are needed to keep the wheels in place as there is no hydraulic pressure for the parking brakes. And it is \u201cstrongly advised that operators avoid using improvised or unapproved items to protect the aircraft and its components\u201d. And as more routes get opened up, more will be put through their paces. Each plane has a specific maintenance manual that details how they are to be taken out of hibernation. All the protective plugs and covers have to be removed, the tires pressure-tested. Brown says the software has to be checked and updated, and all sealed areas will be inspected. Then there are operational checks on all aircraft systems, from avionics to flight control systems. \u201cThey\u2019ll power them up, preferably to the highest levels they\u2019d expect to see in takeoff and in flight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very important with long-term storage there are landing gear checks as well.\u201d To do that, aircraft at Alice Springs will be flown to Sydney with no passengers and the landing gear down, so Sydney engineers can do the final checks.\nThe Civil Aviation Safety Authority has put out a series of high-level checklists for pilots as they return to operations. They include checking for lockdown fatigue or stress, making sure skills are up to scratch, and watching out for long grass, and more birds and animals on runways after periods of inactivity. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced the international travel ban for Australians will lift on 1 November, and hopes for quarantine-free travel bubbles between Australia and Singapore, followed by Bangkok, Phuket, Johannesburg and Fiji. The agreement stands for all states and territories, although they are in varying stages of openness themselves. Qantas announced this week that as it resumes international flights for the first time in 20 months, it will offer more vegetarian food options, and even a signature cocktail to celebrate its return. There will also be a digital travel guide to help passengers navigate the complicated world of vaccine passports, mask mandates, and other Covid-proofing measures. Most international airlines will likely only accept vaccinated passengers, while others will take small numbers of unvaccinated people who will still face hotel quarantine. Apas managing director Tom Vincent says his storage site, with those wingtips gleaming in the desert sun, will still be needed as old planes are reactivated or retired ones disassembled. \u201cTo call us a boneyard is a blight on what we do,\u201d he says.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/there-could-be-snakes-planes-mothballed-by-covid-prepare-to-fly-again", "last_update": "2021-10-31T23:21:54Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "\u2018I desperately want to quit\u2019: the often unbearable burden on Australia\u2019s junior doctors ", "article": "In a busy Melbourne hospital, Paul arrives at work to dozens of patients in the waiting room. The junior doctor is completing a rotation in the emergency department and says morale has plummeted with staffing shortages and huge caseloads. \u201cNo one wants to be at work at all,\u201d he says. Several of his colleagues have quit, and people are calling in sick for their shifts more often. Paul is sent up to 10 messages a day about shifts that need to be filled within the health service, to be paid at \u201ccrisis rates\u201d. \u201cI desperately want to quit. The combination of last year and this year is just exhausting,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll start a night shift and you have nine or 10 hours of wait time and like 40 people waiting to be seen. It\u2019s like this massive wall of work that you know you\u2019re not going to get through, even if everyone works at twice the pace.\u201d Simple comforts that once eased the stress of chaotic shifts, like sharing a meal with a colleague, have fallen by the wayside. \u201cYou can\u2019t even recognise your co-workers if you walk past each other in the street, because [at work] you\u2019ve got an N95 and a face shield,\u201d Paul says. \u201cYou end up just getting really burnt out and really tired.\u201d An already strained system Prof Samuel Harvey, a psychiatrist and deputy director of the Black Dog Institute, says Covid-19 has put additional pressure on a health system that didn\u2019t have much spare capacity in the first place.\nEven before the pandemic began, more than half of doctors were working long hours that put them at risk of clinical fatigue. Medical professionals have a higher suicide risk than the general population, and a recent review led by Harvey, published in The Lancet, found between a quarter and a third of doctors report significant mental ill-health in their early years of training. \u201cMany of us have been aware of [mental health issues in doctors] for a while, but I think Covid-19 has brought it into sharper focus,\u201d Harvey says. Historically, there is stigma associated with reporting mental health issues: a BeyondBlue survey of doctors and medical students previously found that 40% said they judged peers with a history of mental health disorders as \u201cless competent\u201d. Junior doctors \u2013 those in training for specialist accreditation, which can take up to a decade \u2013 report higher levels of distress than their senior counterparts, says Katherine Petrie, also of the Black Dog Institute. A combination of long working hours, studying for exams on top of full-time work, taking on extra research projects, and the competitive pressure of getting accepted on to specialist training programs creates a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for mental distress, she says. A study co-authored by Petrie, Harvey and their colleagues prior to the pandemic found that junior doctors in Australia worked an average of 50 hours a week. One in four reported working more than 55 hours in an average week, which was associated with a doubling in the risk of common mental health problems and suicidal ideation.\n\u201cThere was such stress on the resources and the staffing before Covid,\u201d Petrie says. AI rostering seeks improvements Reduced total working hours and better rostering systems have been floated as options to alleviate these crippling pressures. Prof Mark Wallace at Monash University says it is unlikely, however, that hospitals will be open to systems-wide changes while struggling with Covid. \u201cJust when you need the most optimisation, the most management of resources, is whenever everything\u2019s under pressure and nobody\u2019s got any time to think about it,\u201d he says. Wallace has been involved in developing an AI-powered rostering system, known as AlertSafe, that takes into account how fatigue levels increase over time, as well as the effect of circadian rhythms and working at night. He is in discussions to trial the system in Victorian hospitals. \u201cThe way fatigue builds up over a long time can depend on shift patterns,\u201d he says, adding that studies of similar rostering systems overseas have previously found a 15% drop in medical incidents by minimising staff fatigue. Despite the evidence, it has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d to implement the rostering system in hospitals, even when there has been union and senior management support, Wallace says. \u201cIt quickly falls back into how things used to work before.\u201d That means long hours and overtime work in a system which risks jeopardising fatigued doctors and their patients.\nIn a 2021 Hospital Health Check report, released by the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, 47% of training doctors said they had made a clinical error due to fatigue, while the same percentage said they were never paid for unrostered overtime. Bree, a junior doctor currently working in a stroke unit at a Melbourne hospital, describes it as \u201ca thankless job with consistent abuse\u201d. Some of the stroke team has been seconded to Covid wards, causing staffing shortages. \u201cThe other weekend there were two people covering 75 patients,\u201d Bree says.\nWhile her officially rostered hours have not been excessive, she says she has worked \u201cplenty of overtime\u201d updating patients\u2019 families on their conditions, adding: \u201cThey \u2018forgot\u2019 to roster someone on stroke next week and are trying to get us to work 16-hour shifts to cover them.\u201d Bree has tried escalating her concerns multiple times. \u201cAll I got was a 10 minute \u2018check-in chat\u2019 with administration and a request to \u2018check-in again\u2019 at the end of the [three-month] rotation.\u201d Allegations of systemic underpayment are common: in the past year, five class actions have been brought by thousands of junior doctors in Victoria. In New South Wales, a similar class action is under way, with more than 20,000 training doctors claiming unsafe excessive hours and underpayment. Hayden Stephens, a lawyer representing the claimants in both states, says the cases are motivated by a need to address the dangerous effects of excessive working hours and clinical fatigue on patient care. \u201cA common theme is not just their own welfare but the genuine concerns they have in relation to their patients,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really out of frustration \u2026 that they\u2019ve had to resort to legal process to embark on cultural change in their own workplaces.\u201d\nStephens is currently investigating similar actions for junior doctors in the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia, though no claims have yet been filed. Dr Anthony Llewellyn, who provides career support to trainee doctors, says bullying of junior doctors is also rife, calling it \u201can international problem in medical culture\u201d. In a 2018 survey he conducted of first- and second-year doctors in NSW, more than half of respondents reported being bullied, and one in six said they had experienced sexual harassment. Of those who had experienced bullying or harassment, 40% chose not to speak out, says Llewellyn. \u201cWhen they did choose to take action, most of them reported that the action was not positive for them.\u201d None of the doctors who shared their personal experiences with Guardian Australia were comfortable being identified by their real names. Majority fear burnout As states begin to reopen and significant numbers of Covid patients are admitted to hospital, the strain on an already fatigued workforce is now becoming clearer. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which represents 28,000 specialists and trainees in 33 medical specialities, conducted a survey of its members in September and October.\nReported for the first time by Guardian Australia here, the survey found significant levels of distress among doctors: 87% of respondents said they were concerned about staff burnout, while 76% were worried about an increase in Covid-19 hospital admissions. \u201cThere have been industrial issues associated with the demand on medical staff, meaning longer working hours, out-of-scope activities that medical staff have been asked to do,\u201d says Prof John Wilson, the president of RACP. \u201cIt also means that leave arrangements have unexpectedly been altered or could not be taken as promised.\u201d \u201cThe current environment is leading people to look for escape options,\u201d Wilson says. The college believes that without additional resources, the health system will not cope with the current level of demand. Wilson is calling upon the federal government to release modelling to help medical colleges \u201cplan and also advise on distribution of workforce and training of new medical specialists\u201d. Systemic problems recognised A potential upside of the Covid pandemic is the attention it has brought to the mental health of doctors, Harvey says. As an example, he cites The Essential Network, a federally funded mental health service for healthcare workers, which launched last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve now moved to a point where almost everyone is saying: we agree, the current system is not doing enough to protect the next generation of doctors moving through,\u201d Harvey says. Llewellyn agrees, saying there is now an acknowledgement within the medical community that giving junior doctors \u201cresilience training\u201d to manage workplace stress is not an adequate solution to the problem. At the end of the day, says Monash University\u2019s Harvey, \u201cif you\u2019re going to try and find ways to have junior doctors \u2026 work less severe hours, then there\u2019s going to be a financial implication for us as a society.\u201d \u201cWe as mental health professionals would say that\u2019s the price we have to [pay], because we can\u2019t keep on operating in a system where so many junior doctors become unwell.\u201d Some names have been changed Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 The Black Dog Institute also operates The Essential Network, a confidential service for healthcare workers.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/01/i-desperately-want-to-quit-the-often-unbearable-burden-on-australias-junior-doctors", "last_update": "2021-11-01T10:52:22Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Australia to lift quarantine upon entry for Covid vaccinated Singaporeans", "article": "Australia will reopen quarantine-free entry to fully vaccinated Singaporeans from 21 November. The new travel agreement follows a meeting between Scott Morrison and the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Rome on Sunday. The two governments have agreed that Singaporeans departing from Singapore can travel to Australia without having to quarantine after arrival. There will be no requirement to have spent 14 days in Singapore prior to departure. Last week, Singapore announced Australia would be included in its vaccinated travel lanes arrangements. Fully vaccinated Australians will be able to enter the country without quarantining from 8 November. Australia is also keen to welcome back Singaporean students as universities and other education institutions reopen their campuses. More than 130,000 Singaporeans have graduated from Australian universities, and since 2014, 3,360 Australian students have undertaken study and internships in Singapore under the New Colombo Plan.\nQuarantine-free travel from New Zealand to Australia will resume from Monday, and during a meeting with the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, in Rome, Scott Morrison said Australia was also keen to facilitate travel to Bali as soon as practicable. Morrison said quarantine-free travel from Singapore was consistent with the reopening objectives set down in the national plan. According to the national plan, once vaccination rates reach 80% Australia will extend travel bubbles for unrestricted travel to countries including Singapore and Pacific nations.\n\u201cThis means within weeks Australia will be welcoming tourists from two of our top ten travel destinations,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is the billion-dollar boost that Australia\u2019s tourism industry has been waiting for.\u201d Earlier in October, Australia took two steps to restart international travel, with the New South Wales government announcing vaccinated travellers would be able to come through Sydney without hotel or home quarantine and the Morrison government lifting the outbound travel ban from 1 November. Victoria has also agreed to scrap quarantine for fully vaccinated international arrivals from Monday.\nQantas has confirmed that flights to Singapore will resume on 23 November, four weeks earlier than scheduled. The airline will operate flights three days a week, ramping up to daily flights from 18 December. Jetstar will fly from Melbourne and Darwin to Singapore from 16 December. Australia\u2019s national carrier says 11,000 Australia-based staff will be back at work in early December, with a new route to New Delhi, and flights from Sydney to Bangkok, Phuket, Johannesburg and Fiji resuming ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, Morrison dampened the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet\u2019s announcement of quarantine-free travel to Sydney by warning that Australian citizens, residents and their families would be prioritised over tourists, students and other visa holders. On Sunday the tourism minister, Dan Tehan, told Weekend Sunrise he hoped foreign workers and students could begin coming to Australia \u201cbefore Christmas\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cWe want to make sure that with New Zealand and Singapore, we\u2019re opening up successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we want to bring that workforce in that we need, those working holiday visa makers, our agricultural workforce. \u201cAnd then hopefully before Christmas, we might even see some international tourists coming, so exciting times.\u201d \u201cTourism Australia will look to scale up its marketing activities in New Zealand, with an immediate focus on building confidence and broadening knowledge of the depth of Australia\u2019s tourism offering,\u201d Tehan said in a statement on Sunday.

{"title": "Tim Krul gifts Rodrigo winner for Leeds against doomed-looking Norwich", "article": "There was no rallying cry, no guttural exhortation, no last-ditch roar of hope. The Carrow Road tannoy informed Norwich\u2019s faithful that their team would have five added minutes to salvage this game and possibly to dredge some meaning from this most bleak of seasons, but the news was met with barely a murmur. This was apathy rather than open revolt: the atmosphere had been equable throughout but that had its own implications. There are still 28 games left but the acceptance phase of grief has reached these parts with alarming speed and, on this evidence, only a wild optimist would suggest the Canaries are in for anything beyond a long and painful winter. In the moments after Anthony Taylor blew for full time, Tim Krul walked towards the Barclay end and raised his hands in a mea culpa. It was Krul who let Rodrigo\u2019s speculative shot slip through him on the hour, puncturing the swell of something resembling belief that Andrew Omobamidele\u2019s equaliser had inspired. Norwich never recovered; Leeds were nothing special here, still well short of recapturing their old vim, but comfortably saw out a win that should postpone any lurch into crisis mode for Marcelo Bielsa.\nIt means the question marks over Bielsa\u2019s opposite number, Daniel Farke, grow bolder. Despite Norwich\u2019s miserable haul of two points, which extends across 20 top-flight games if their end to the 2019-20 season is accounted for, that feels slightly harsh. He is a good man and has done an outstanding job leading Norwich, directionless when he arrived, to two promotions. But, as the sporting director, Stuart Webber, reminded everyone on Wednesday, he has been better equipped this time around: Norwich and their glut of recruits are yet to make a fist of things and, as a minimum, that must surely change soon. \u201cWe are not playing for warm words, we are playing for points,\u201d Farke said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t achieve them in games like this, it\u2019s difficult to achieve our targets and earn the right to stay in the league.\u201d Two seasons ago Norwich\u2019s quixotic endeavours did indeed earn praise even if they were ultimately blown away. Now they simply look blunt when on the front foot and porous in their attempts to tighten up; it is a mix that will, at this rate, mean their latest yo-yo back to the Championship is sealed well before May. \u201cWhat is lacking is the quality in both boxes,\u201d the head coach admitted. There was no shortage of effort and Norwich could contend that, in a frayed first half, they had held the upper hand. A skittish Leeds had created the only genuine chance, Dan James skipping around Krul before seeing Grant Hanley stretch to clear off the line, but it was clear Farke had sent his players out to show some initiative. Driving runs from Ozan Kabak, Mathias Normann and Kenny McLean kept interest levels high; Teemu Pukki flashed wide from 18 yards and Milot Rashica, lively on the left, made Illan Meslier sprawl to save from distance. It was a sight more palatable than the surrender at Chelsea. But 11 minutes into the second half Norwich were punctured when Raphinha, back from injury, received James\u2019 swept pass and jinked inside from the right. Past Omobamidele, past Hanley, one step ahead ofKabak\u2019s pained lunge: he drilled low past Krul for an opener out of keeping with proceedings and Leeds, hitherto loose, had their breakthrough. They might have wished the game was still goalless given the apparent change in momentum when Omobamidele rose to meet a Rashica corner conceded sloppily by Meslier, and head his first senior goal. Seasons have turned on less for relegation strugglers but Norwich instantly threw their reprieve away. First Kabak was robbed by Pascal Struijk; then the otherwise patchy Kalvin Phillips took the initiative and found Rodrigo, whose strike from almost 30 yards perhaps dipped late but should still not have beaten Krul.\n\u201cThe performance was a deserved victory,\u201d said Bielsa. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy game to play for us.\u201d Leeds finally gathered composure when ahead for the second time and looked likelier to score the next goal. The margins in the table\u2019s nether reaches were so fine at the outset, though, that any other outcome would have seen Bielsa fielding the tough questions. Instead those were reserved for Farke. \u201cThere\u2019s only 20 managers allowed to work on this level, 20 teams to play in this level, and, if you can\u2019t handle that pressure, you cannot work here,\u201d he said. Bielsa made a point of praising Farke\u2019s \u201cspiritual fortitude\u201d; Norwich already need an act of god, and everyone here knew it.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/31/norwich-leeds-premier-league-match-report", "last_update": "2021-10-31T20:49:58Z", "source": "Guardian"},
{"title": "Italy\u2019s father of tiramisu dies aged 93", "article": "An Italian restaurateur known as the \u201cfather of tiramisu\u201d has died aged 93. Ado Campeol died at his home in Treviso, in the Veneto region, on Saturday. Although the dessert\u2019s origins are often disputed and the family never asserted copyright over the recipe, Campeol and his wife, Alba, the owners of the restaurant Alle Beccherie, are widely considered to be its inventors.\nAccording to historians, the dish \u2013 featuring egg yolks whipped with mascarpone cheese, layered over coffee-soaked biscuits and topped with bitter cocoa powder \u2013 was added to their restaurant\u2019s menu in 1972. The word tiramis\u00f9, literally translated as \u201clift me up\u201d, comes from the Treviso dialect\u2019s \u201ctireme su\u201d, and the dessert was claimed to have aphrodisiac effects. Roberto Linguanotto, a chef who worked at Alle Beccherie and is described by many as the dessert\u2019s co-inventor, said tiramisu was the result of an accident. Campeol\u2019s son Carlo, who now runs the restaurant, said: \u201cWhen Alba was breastfeeding me a few years earlier, she had turned to mascarpone mixed with sugar and biscuits soaked in coffee to keep her energy up, which is traditional in Treviso. Then, with her chef, she turned those elements into a pudding.\u201d Campeol had worked since he was a young boy at Le Beccherie, which his family took over in 1939. \u201cMy father was an extremely correct person, very attached to his family, a serious professional,\u201d Carlo told the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera. \u201cHe was an inspiration to us all\u201d. The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe city lost another star in its food and wine history.\u201d In 2013 Zaia pushed to win EU certification for the sweet, which would set in stone the exact ingredients used the day it was invented in Campeol\u2019s. Numerous variations of tiramisu exist. Some chefs use other cakes such as panettone. Although the original recipe \u2013 certified by the Italian Academy of Cuisine in 2010 \u2013 was alcohol-free, variants include alcohol such as rum or marsala. \u201cEvery country has their own taste,\u201d Linguanotto once said. \u201cAs long as it lifts you up, it\u2019s fine by me.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/31/father-of-tiramisu-ado-campeol-dies", "last_update": "2021-10-31T18:06:35Z", "source": "Guardian"}
