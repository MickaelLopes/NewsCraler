{"title": "A 250-year symphony: The many movie angles on Beethoven", "article": "The biopic may have a reputation for stodginess but it\u2019s actually one of the\nmost malleable of storytelling instruments. If you don\u2019t believe it, take a\nlook at Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s long and colourful history on screen.\n\nWe\u2019ve had Beethoven as romantic hero, political animal, irascible old man and,\nfinally and most fancifully, Beethoven the late-blooming feminist.\n\nAs we celebrate his 250th birthday, let\u2019s start with _Immortal Beloved_\n(1994), a headlong tour of Beethoven\u2019s love life by British writer Bernard\nRose, with Gary Oldman at his brooding best. Rose really took a gamble with\nthis one, tackling the most persistent mystery in Beethoven\u2019s life \u2013 the\nidentity of the woman whom he addressed as \u201cimmortal beloved\u201d in a letter\nfound among his papers after his death.\n\nRose nominated a complete outsider for the title, an interpretation which\nnecessitated a comprehensive rearrangement of one of the key episodes in the\ncomposer\u2019s personal life. Beethoven scholars were not impressed but the film\ncan\u2019t be dismissed. It plays as if directed in a state of delirium with Georg\nSolti and the London Symphony Orchestra pumping up the emotional levels and\nenhancing Oldman\u2019s performance to such effect that fans and critics alike have\nchosen to forgive the improbabilities and surrender to the mood.\n\nRose was not the first filmmaker to take on the \u201cimmortal beloved\u201d question.\nIt was Austrian silent film director Hans Otto who first explored Beethoven\u2019s\nperpetually troubled love life on screen in his 1927 silent movie _Das Leben\ndes Beethoven_ , starring Fritz Kortner. In 1936, French master Abel Gance\ndirected _Un Grand Amour de Beethoven_ , which strips down the composer\u2019s many\namours to a single irregular triangle formed by his desire for his student,\nJulie Guicciardi, his long relationship with the steadfast Hungarian\nnoblewoman, Therese von Brunsvik, and his overriding passion for composition.\n\nIn this version, it\u2019s the music, rather than the man, which provides the\nallure, since Gance\u2019s casting flouts all the usual standards of movie glamour.\nAs his Beethoven, he chose the French stage actor Harry Baur, a hulking figure\nwith many chins and a sincerely doomstruck expression. No one could ever have\naccused him of being an irrepressible lover but he was skilled in the art of\nthe subtle adjustment and, decades on, his close-ups retain their poignancy.\n\nRadically deviating from fact, Gance has him marry Therese but yearn after\nJulie, to whom he awards the \u201cimmortal beloved\u201d title.\n\nA more realistic \u2013 and typically British \u2013 approach is at work in director\nSimon Cellan Jones\u2019 BBC TV movie _Eroica_ (2003). It focuses on a single\nepisode: the first performance of Beethoven\u2019s Third Symphony in Vienna before\nhis patron, Prince Lobkowitz (Jack Davenport), and a small group of his fellow\naristocrats. The Napoleonic wars are the topic de jour, Beethoven is still a\nBonaparte admirer (that was soon to change) and a verbal skirmish breaks out\nin the Prince\u2019s drawing room. A supercilious Tim Piggott-Smith, cast as an\nAustrian count, is patronising Beethoven (Ian Hart) in an attempt to learn\nwhere he fits in the prevailing class system. Are you a land owner? he asks,\nprompting an amused Beethoven to answer: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a brain owner.\u201d It\u2019s the\nsignal for hostilities to begin.\n\nNone of these fictional embellishments can match those that Agnieszka Holland\nand her writers came up with in 2006 in _Copying Beethoven_. In a performance\nwhich matches Oldman\u2019s for its quicksilver shifts in volume, Ed Harris plays\nthe irretrievably grumpy Beethoven during his last years. He\u2019s finishing the\nNinth Symphony and he needs a copyist, which conforms to reality. He had two,\nboth male. But in the film, he takes on Anna (Diane Kruger), a young woman\ndefying the conventions of the time by aspiring to be a composer.\n\nThe script wisely resists any hint of romance. Beethoven is jealous only of\nthe time Anna spends thinking of something other than his symphony. But in\nstanding up to him, she does change his mind about what women can and can\u2019t\ndo. And the relationship does persuade \u2013 right up to the climactic scene in\nwhich Beethoven, now completely deaf, conducts the Ninth for the first time\nwith Anna giving him his cues from a seat among the musicians.\n\nThere have been other features, documentaries and TV series. In the early\n1960s, the composer landed in Disneyland as the hero of a two-part special\nstarring Karlheinz Bohm, son of the conductor Karl Boehm. Ironically, given\nthe vanilla-flavoured nature of the exercise, Bohm became much more famous\nseven years later as the perverted lead character in British director Michael\nPowell\u2019s cultish thriller _Peeping Tom_.\n\nThen came the bicentennial year when Beethoven became entangled in post-\nmodernism via _Ludwig Van_ , a puckish offering by German-based Argentinian\ncomposer Mauricio Kagel. A confection of parody, burlesque and satire aimed at\nthe packaging and mass-marketing of art, it was not a popular success.\n\nAll of these films have helped to illuminate aspects of Beethoven\u2019s art, life\nand personality. They might have played fast and loose with history, but they\nmake up a mosaic, encouraging you to ask questions about what might have been.\nMore importantly, they demonstrate the intimacy of film \u2013 its ability to bring\nyou the look, sound and atmosphere of the past. The biopic is much maligned.\n\n", "url": "/culture/movies/a-250-year-symphony-the-many-movie-angles-on-beethoven-20200408-p54iao.html", "last_update": "2020-04-24T06:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "SSO chief conductor and artistic director brought Italian passion", "article": "**GIANLUIGI GELMETTI: 1945\u20132021**\n\nWith grizzled beard and broad smile, fierce eyes and spirit as generous as his\ngirth, conductor Gianluigi Gelmetti, chief conductor and artistic director of\nthe Sydney Symphony Orchestra from 2004 to 2008, exuded sensuous enjoyment of\nmusic as of life.\n\nViolinist and concertmaster Dene Olding recalls \u201cGG\u201d (as he was affectionately\nknown) as \u201ca compassionate, jovial man who exemplified \u2018la dolce vita\u2019, a\nbridge between the modern approach and the great Italian conductors of the\npast and a good friend off the podium\u201d.\n\nAs the first Italian to hold the position of SSO chief conductor, Gelmetti had\nalready fired enthusiasm among players and listeners as a guest conductor,\nincluding a galvanising performance of Stravinsky\u2019s _The Rite of Spring_ in\n1993.\n\n\u201cWhat I remember from the performance,\u201d recalls SSO cellist and ABC Director\nof Music Nathan Waks, \u201cwas firstly the effortless and precise conducting\ntechnique, making light work of the complex and savage rhythms which so often\nlead to less than satisfactory results \u2026 But more impressive even than the\ntechnical brilliance of that night was how the extraordinary colours and\ntextures in the less hectic parts of the work were brought out in a revelatory\nfashion.\u201d\n\nGianluigi Gelmetti was born in Rome on September 11, 1945 and studied\nconducting with the Romanian conductor Sergiu Celibidache, with Franco Ferrara\n(who also taught Riccardo Chailly and Riccardo Muti), at the Conservatorio\nSanta Cecilia in Rome and with Hungarian Hans Swarowsky.\n\nAfter serving as principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra\nfrom 1989 to 1998, he was appointed musical director of the Teatro dell\u2019Opera\ndi Roma in 2000, a role he held concurrently with the Sydney position. That\nconnection enabled two-way traffic of Italian and Australian musicians.\n\nFor his opening concert as chief conductor and artistic director, he brought\nCarla Maria Izzo and Daniela Barcellona (who returned for many memorable\nperformances) and the Rome Opera chorus for a richly blended, surging\nperformance of Verdi\u2019s _Requiem_ , while Australian singer Jessica Pratt and\nconductors Dane Lam and Daniel Smith launched European careers after studies\nin the Eternal City.\n\nWith street banners around the city greeting his arrival, Gelmetti was a\nnatural ambassador for Italian culture, his endorsements sought for everything\nfrom furniture to pasta. Waks, who witnessed a masterclass on spaghetti\ncarbonara, divulged his secret: \u201cOne of the most important elements, apart\nfrom al dente texture, is the sparing use of sauce, of whatever type. GG\nexplained that the sauce should just coat the pasta, which must always be the\nhero. Not unlike his most successful musical interpretations.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, Gelmetti liked the SSO\u2019s openness to new ideas and embarked on\ncreating what he saw as a \u201cSydney sound\u201d \u2013 with equal balance between string\nsections. He increased the double basses to 12 and repositioned them at the\nback to permeate the whole texture, though the idea had mixed reception.\nAlthough introduced in line with his view of Verdi\u2019s intentions, it was an\napproach that often worked best in Brahms, Beethoven and Mahler.\n\nOlding recalls a particularly memorable performance of Schubert\u2019s Symphony No.\n9 in C (\u201cThe Great\u201d). \u201cThe best concert performances are those in which time\nseems to stand still for the players and the audience. Orchestral musicians\nwill know how tiring this piece is to play and how it can feel endless when\nthe interpretation is not optimum. Gelmetti made this performance effortless\nand the sound of the orchestra had a certain resonance not often achieved.\u201d\n\nA composer as well as conductor, Gelmetti sought to champion new works, giving\nfirst performances of the music of Australian Liza Lim and creating a series,\n\u201cThe Shock of the New\u201d, in which old and new works, played without a break,\nwere back-announced after being heard, with the audience encouraged not to\nread the program until afterwards.\n\nLibby Christie, managing director of the SSO during his tenure, witnessed at\nfirst hand his interest in Australia and Australian music. \u201cHe travelled\nextensively in regional NSW, conducting our regional tours, visiting distant\ncommunities including Broken Hill, Griffith, Armidale and Lismore among quite\na few others \u2026 But while he was out and about in the bush, he didn\u2019t give up\nhis Italian habits and was surprised to find that it was hard to find a\nrestaurant open in regional Australia at 10pm at night after a concert!\u201d\n\nTimothy Calnin, director of artistic planning at the SSO until 2004, recalls:\n\u201cHe was a conductor who was very particular about adding repertoire and didn\u2019t\never take on new scores lightly. Making programs and selecting guest artists\nwas much more difficult with Gelmetti, especially as he was wary of working\nwith soloists he hadn\u2019t worked with before. His rather limited list of\npreferred soloists was almost exclusively Italian (Michele Campanella, Andrea\nLucchesini, Mario Brunello, Salvatore Accardo \u2026).\u201d\n\nSSO principal cellist Catherine Hewgill appreciated his artistic\nidiosyncrasies. \u201cI will never forget his attendance at auditions, which often\ntook place the night after a performance, where he would saunter in looking\nlike a weary rock star, his sunglasses never leaving his face. He would always\narrive five minutes late for rehearsals, his assistant carrying the heavy\nscores on stage for him, and he would be wearing his trademark long black\nshirt, of which he apparently had many, but they were all the same.\u201d\n\nAlthough well known in Europe as a conductor of opera, the only full opera he\nconducted in Sydney was a supple and intriguing concert performance of\nPuccini\u2019s neglected late work _La Rondine_ in 2006. Noted as a conductor of\nRossini, where he conducted several works for the Pesaro Rossini Festival, his\nRossini performances in Sydney were limited to concert performances, including\na Rossini Gala in 2007 with a towering performance by Barcellona in the\ncomposer\u2019s _Stabat Mater_. On one occasion, he accompanied the serenade from\n_The Barber of Seville_ on guitar. A crowning achievement was the award of a\nRossini d\u2019Oro for a complete performance of the composer\u2019s frequently cut last\nmasterpiece, _Guillaume Tell_. Waks recalls \u201ca wonderful performance, with the\nfour hours passing in a flash, with many memorable moments, including a very\ncontrolled and therefore much more exciting overture\u201d.\n\nOn arriving in Sydney, Gelmetti had compared the relationship of orchestra and\nchief conductor to a marriage, and by 2006 it was clear this one was starting\nto cool, with his announcement that he would depart at the end of his five-\nyear contract. The end of his Sydney contract also saw the final year of his\nposition in Rome, and in 2012 he was appointed principal conductor of the\nOrchestre Philharmonique de Monte Carlo, where he stayed until 2016.\n\nIn addition to his substantial positions, Gelmetti performed regularly in\nGermany and across Europe, and frequently worked in Japan with the NHK\nSymphony Orchestra and the Japan Philharmonic and, in his later years, in\nQatar.\n\nThroughout his career, Gelmetti was also involved in education, working with\nYouth Music Australia to create a memorable performance of Mahler\u2019s First\nSymphony in Melbourne in 1995. When he commenced his Sydney position he\nlamented that absence, bar a few luminaries, of Australian conductors both in\nAustralia and overseas. As well as his involvement in the ABC\u2019s conducting\nprogram, he taught conducting at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Sienna and\nthe Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome.\n\nThough larger than life, his personality had complex layers. He loved applause\nand proudly brought his new baby daughter, Bianca Laura, onto the stage after\none concert to meet the audience. Olding recalls a different side: \u201cI remember\nhis first day at rehearsal where his opening remarks to the orchestra were\nfull of respect for his players and reflected his Christian values of \u2018do unto\nothers\u2026\u2019 etc. He had a genuine warmth, love of life in a typically Italian\nway, and a love of music.\u201d\n\nAfter a performance of Beethoven\u2019s _Missa Solemnis_ for World Youth Day in\n2008 he took up the work\u2019s final words in a heart-felt plea at the curtain\ncall, \u201cpacem, pacem!\u201d As Waks recalls: \u201cHe was a verismo Italian operatic\ncharacter in every sense. Despite his clearly unbalanced physique, I thought\nhim indestructible and assumed he would outlive us all.\u201d\n\n **Peter McCallum**\n\n", "url": "/national/sso-chief-conductor-and-artistic-director-brought-italian-passion-20210823-p58l5w.html", "last_update": "2021-08-23T08:13:19Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Music reviews: Braids, LA Priest, Hans Knappertsbusch and Jim Snidero", "article": "**ART POP**\n\n **LA Priest**\n\n ** _GENE_ (Domino)**\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nSam Eastgate, the man behind the LA Priest moniker, initially came into view\nin the late 2000s as front man with the British indie-rave act Late of the\nPier before releasing his heavily Prince-influenced debut as LA Priest, _Inji_\n, in 2015. Then came _Soft Hair_ , a wildly eccentric (and lascivious)\ncollaboration with Connan Mockasin in 2016. _Gene_ just about trumps all of\nthat. This is a mesmerising concoction of DIY electronica, lazy funk and\nimaginative pop that strikes an ingenious balance between the insanely catchy\nand the experimental and abstract. The opener, _Beginning_ , as well as _What\nMoves_ and _Peace Lily,_ are all soul-infused melodic triumphs, while songs\nsuch as _Black Smoke_ and the magnificent _Kissing of the Weeds_ are more\nsprawling and challenging curios. The latter two tracks make particularly\ninnovative use of Eastgate\u2019s homemade modular drum machine, pictured on the\ncover \u2014 the name of which gives the record its title. _Gene_ is a frisky yet\nalso beautifully melancholic exploration of the intersection of emotion and\ngroove from one of Britain\u2019s most playful pop minds. And it\u2019s pronounced \"la\npriest\". **BARNABY SMITH**\n\n **CLASSICAL**\n\nHans Knappertsbusch\n\n _BRUCKNER SYMPHONIES 3, 4, 5, 8_ (Decca Eloquence)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nHans Knappertsbusch was one of five great German conductors born around 1885.\nWith Klemperer, Furtwangler, Busch and Scherchen, he carried the German\ntradition well into the 20th century, as this 1950s-60s set of four Bruckner\nsymphonies enticingly demonstrates. It's also an interesting historical legacy\nbecause Knappertsbusch uses heavily edited scores, popular in the early 20th\ncentury, that have long been rejected in favour of more authentic editions.\nAnyone familiar with these symphonies from more modern recordings will be\nbemused but intrigued by quite significant changes to the music. \"Kna\", as he\nwas known, leads the Vienna Philharmonic in the first three and the Munich\nPhilharmonic in No 8 (1963). Even more famous as a Wagnerian, Kna was a\ncelebrated Bruckner conductor, with a marvellously architectural conception of\nthese massive works, allied with flexibility, real momentum and dramatic flair\neliciting exciting climaxes. Reviewers at the time highlighted his skill in\nbringing out Viennese dance rhythms that can be lost in more monumental\ninterpretations. The first two symphonies are mono, the second two stereo, but\nthe mono sound is acceptable, and the liner notes excellent. **BARNEY ZWARTZ**\n\n **JAZZ**\n\nJim Snidero\n\n _PROJECT-K_ (Savant)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAt first you think there's a guitar in the ensemble, and then you hear more\nclearly the teardrop-shaped notes of Do Yeon Kim's gayageum, ancient Korean\ncousin of the koto. Jazz being a language rather than an idiom, the instrument\nreadily slots into this music's neon vibrancy. Jim Snidero is a swashbuckling\nalto saxophonist, and his compositions are not so much underpinned by grooves\nas driven by winds. It takes phenomenal sophistication and sensitivity from\nthe rhythm section to achieve that effect, and Australian Linda May Han Oh\n(Pat Metheny's bassist) and Rudy Royston (Bill Frisell's drummer) are\noutstanding at propelling the pieces without weighing them down. They make the\nmusic an airy place, and deploy dynamics so that an instrument as delicate as\nthe gayageum can sing its gentle songs without fighting to be heard. Another\nof Oh's regular employers, trumpeter Dave Douglas, is also present, lacing the\nmusic with his skittish lines, and the band is completed by the spare,\nfascinating conception of pianist Orrin Evans from the Bad Plus. Asian-\nflavoured melodic motifs happily cohabit with post-bop orthodoxies, the alto's\nsharp edge and the rustle of the rhythm section. **JOHN SHAND**\n\n **ART ROCK**\n\nBraids\n\n _SHADOW OFFERING_ (City Secret/Remote Control)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nWith its dreamy synth palette, delicate hi-hat accents and Raphaelle Standell-\nPreston\u2019s breathy vocals, the opener _Here 4 U_ could fool you into thinking\nthis album will be rather restful. On the contrary; the Montreal-based trio\ndeliver their rawest, angriest and most emotionally direct opus yet, never\nmade for easy listening. The off-kilter rhythms demand attention and the vocal\nphrases end unexpectedly, insisting that we focus or risk missing something\nvital. The lyrics are important, whether it\u2019s the vulnerability in _Fear Of\nMen_ (\u201cHere on my two feet/I\u2019m just trying to beat/All the fears that hold me\nback\u201d) or a spoken tirade amid the tumultuous nine minutes of _Snow Angel_ ,\nin which Standell-Preston unleashes her fears for the planet, politics and the\nfuture in a delivery that escalates to a trembling hysteria. Fans of our own\nSally Seltmann will appreciate the whimsical, stumbling melody lines and\npainful earnestness, but there's an overarching intensity here that is\nexhausting. Confusingly, despite its relentless need to stare pain right in\nthe face, the deliveries are often dreamy and nostalgic, which, as Standell-\nPreston hisses in _Snow Angel,_ \u201cmakes the bitterness feel romantic\u201d. **JESSIE\nCUNNIFFE**\n\n", "url": "/culture/music/music-reviews-braids-la-priest-hans-knappertsbusch-and-jim-snidero-20200615-p552mk.html", "last_update": "2020-06-15T06:49:54Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Sophie Hutchings beguiles with spellbinding new album", "article": "**NEW AGE INSTRUMENTAL  \n** Sophie Hutchings  \n _SCATTERED ON THE WIND_ (Mercury KX)  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to ignore Sophie Hutchings\u2019 affinity with water. To dive into\nthis album is to be swallowed whole by an ocean of her creation: wild, fierce,\nbeguiling and melancholy. Plumbing the depths of the piano\u2019s melodic range,\nshe creates undulating, post-minimalist soundscapes that are as fearsome as\nthey are fragile. Olafur Arnalds\u2019 haunting theme for the TV series\n_Broadchurch_ immediately springs to mind: surely a close sonic cousin of\nthese aquatic explorations. The spine-tingling soprano voices in _Scattered on\nthe Wind \u2013 Pt 2_ and whale-call string glissandi in _Your Heart_ are testament\nto the album\u2019s stunning grace and poise: tasteful accents that heighten rather\nthan clutter the experience. Bass lines with the gravitas of a Hans Zimmer\nscore underpin sparkling top notes that play out hypnotic, rippling melodies.\nSound engineer Tim Whitten captures the icy harmonics of the top notes and\nwarmth of the middle range for an intimate, yet otherworldly, timbre. Only in\nthe final couple of tracks do you get a sense that we have been in relentless\nmotion this whole time, and yet, like the waves, it\u2019s as soothing as it is\nrestless. **JESSIE CUNNIFFE**\n\n **SINGER-SONGWRITER  \n** Brendan Gallagher  \n _RESTLESS CREATURE_ (brendangallaghermusic.com)  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nThough an understated presence both on record and on stage, Brendan\nGallagher\u2019s contribution to Australian music should never be underestimated.\nApart from the vast back catalogue of albums, his book _The Open Tuning Chord_\n_Book_ _for Guitar_ serviced a generation of drone-happy folk guitarists. To\ncelebrate 50 years in music, Gallagher has created an album made up mostly of\ncovers by artists ranging from the Beatles ( _You Can\u2019t Do That_ ) and Jimi\nHendrix ( _Stone Free_ ) to contemporary acts such as Ngaiire. Gallagher\u2019s\nreinterpretations generally stay faithful to the originals (the Ngaiire track\nexcepted), with arrangements embracing honky-tonk country, 1950s rock\u2019n\u2019roll\nand on to a moody, minimal version of Dylan\u2019s _A Simple Twist of Fate_. But\nit\u2019s actually the two Gallagher originals that are the most exciting\nperformances: the beautifully melodic title track and _Sweetie_ (originally\nrecorded by Gallagher\u2019s former band the Leisuremasters), an effortlessly\natmospheric instrumental. While not the most important release of his career,\n_Restless Creature_ is a comprehensive guide to Gallagher\u2019s inspirations.\n**BARNABY SMITH**\n\n **JAZZ  \n** Josh Bennier  \n _MODULAR_ (joshbennier.com)  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nJosh Bennier astutely builds improvising into the structures of his\ncompositions, rather than just decorating song-forms with solos, so each\nplayer is given a context in which to carry the work forward on its\nmultifaceted journey. The exceptional young trombonist bristles with so many\nideas that he happily squeezes a swag of them into a single work, where many\ncomposers would have fashioned each thought into its own piece. From the\nlistener\u2019s point of view this is heaven, because the music keeps turning\nunexpected corners and revealing new vistas, whether of rhythm (often Latin-\ntinged), texture, harmony, density, velocity or simply exquisite melodies. To\ngive the music the breadth he desires, Bennier has assembled a septet, but\nwith only one other horn (alto saxophonist Zac O\u2019Connell), otherwise opting\nfor instruments to maximise the orchestral heft: piano (Stuart McGowan),\nguitar (Theo Carbo), bass (Patrick Fitzgerald), drums (Luke Andresen) and\npercussion (Cristian Saavedra). All are sophisticated improvisers who amply\nrepay the trust of being able to determine much of the colouring of Bennier\u2019s\nimaginative templates. **JOHN SHAND**\n\n **POP  \n** The Magnetic Fields  \n _QUICKIES_ (Nonesuch)  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nStephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields loves a concept and believes in truth in\nadvertising. His masterwork, 1999\u2019s _69 Love Songs,_ was exactly what it said;\nfor 2017\u2019s _50 Song Memoir,_ he wrote a song for each year of his life. His\n12th album, _Quickies,_ is a 28-song set of miniatures, with no song hitting\nthe three-minute mark. Some last a matter of seconds. Many sound like dares or\na lark. Can you write a sweet piano track called _The Day the Politicians\nDied_? How about one called _Kill a Man a Week_ , but it has to be a sing-\nalong and last less than a minute? Merritt, whose vocals seem to be getting\ndeeper than the San Andreas Fault as he ages, shares the lead with the bright-\nvoiced Shirley Simms and the smoky Claudia Gonson, while the backing is a\njunk-store of twang, pluck and zing, incorporating omnichords, autoharps,\nbanjoleles and homemade cigar-box instruments. Is it quirky? Well, duh. And\nmusically the songs are the equivalent of notebook sketches.

There are also some Founding Fathers on the list, including\nThomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nBut there are some other eyebrow-raising picks beyond Guthrie.\n\nThere were several entertainers, including Louis Armstrong, Lauren Bacall,\nHumphrey Bogart, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Charlton Heston, Alfred\nHitchcock, Bob Hope, Elvis Presley and the host of game show _Jeopardy!_ ,\nAlex Trebek, who died in November 2020.\n\nAlso on the list: political theorist Hannah Arendt, whose 1951 book _The\nOrigins of Totalitarianism_ enjoyed renewed sales in 2017 after Trump became\nPresident.\n\nThe site for Trump\u2019s requested sculpture garden has yet to be determined.\n\nWhen he first announced plans for the garden last northern summer, Trump\npainted it as a response to Black Lives Matter protesters, whom he claimed\nwere waging a \u201cmerciless\u201d war against \u201cour national heritage\u201d by tearing down\nsome monuments honouring leaders of confederacy.\n\n\u201cThese statues are not ours alone, to be discarded at the whim of those\ninflamed by fashionable political passions; they belong to generations that\nhave come before us and to generations yet unborn,\u201d Trump said in his\nstatement about his original executive order on July 3. \u201cMy Administration\nwill not abide an assault on our collective national memory. In the face of\nsuch acts of destruction, it is our responsibility as Americans to stand\nstrong against this violence, and to peacefully transmit our great national\nstory to future generations through newly commissioned monuments to American\nheroes.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete list:\n\nAnsel Adams\n\nJohn Adams\n\nSamuel Adams\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nLuis Walter Alvarez\n\nSusan B.

{"title": "PM shift towards net zero may be too little, too late", "article": "Very much like an iceberg in the Arctic, Scott Morrison is slowly melting to\nthe idea of taking some sort of climate change action (\u201c\u201d, February 2), but it\nhas to be targeted, incremental and won\u2019t cost the people who vote for him any\nmoney. The trouble with this approach is by the time he does anything, we\u2019re\nall cooked. **Chris Moe, Bensville**\n\nThe idea to have zero emissions by almost 30 years from now is the Prime\nMinister playing politics. It\u2019s a put-off. The Coalition has had the past 10\nyears to devise a plan and all we\u2019ve got is obfuscation. **Lyle Keats,\nMiranda**\n\nI would be nice to think that our PM has set a more ambitious climate change\ntarget but, as with his contribution to addressing the wide range of issues\nconfronting Indigenous Australians by changing one word in the national\nanthem, he tip-toes around the sensitivities of his die-hard conservatives. To\nsay the \u201cour goal is to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible\u201d commits\nthe government to nothing. **Bill Johnstone, Blackheath**\n\nKicking and screaming and with fingernail marks still on that lacquered\nparliamentary lump of coal, Morrison finally concedes \u2013 a little. There\u2019s\nprogressive and conservative, there\u2019s radical and reactionary, there\u2019s\nvisionary and pragmatist and there\u2019s dumb and dumber. I\u2019d prefer the former in\neach case. What we still have is the latter in spades. **Peter Russell,\nCoogee**\n\nNote to the Prime Minister: the science tells us that we don\u2019t have a blank\ncheque for climate change either. **Stuart Kean, Berowra Heights**\n\nWe\u2019re making progress! Scott Morrison\u2019s rhetoric on climate change is shifting\nfrom \u201cwe\u2019ll do as little as possible\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll now try a little bit\u201d. **Alan\nFry, Winmalee**\n\nFirst we had the \u201cfor we are one and free\u201d charade in the hope that it would\nlook like Morrison is interested in Indigenous matters. Now he\u2019s floating a\n\u201cgoal to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible\u201d to paint some kind of\nimpression that he\u2019s doing something about climate change. It is so inadequate\nas to be laughable. **Nedra Orme, Neutral Bay**\n\nTargets are easy to set up. Much harder to hit. Especially those moveable,\nlong-range targets viewed through the smoke-haze from burning coals. **Joy\nCooksey, Harrington**\n\nWhen I see a headline like \u201cPM shifts towards net zero emissions\u201d, I feel that\nwhat this means is that the PM and his team have come up with a marketing\nstrategy to make their current stance of doing nothing look like a positive\nplan. **Don Squires, Lake Cathie**\n\nCould this be the breakthrough many of us have been waiting for? I suggest\nScott Morrison changes his nickname from Scomo to Zero, just in case his\n\u201chope\u201d gets forgotten in the murky politics of climate change. **Nick\nFranklin, Katoomba**\n\nPM shifts \u2033\u2063towards\u2033\u2063 net zero emissions. Ah, the Duke (of Plaza-Toro).\nLeading from behind again.  \n **Brian Milton, Avalon**\n\n### Coalition\u2019s tired ideology on tax holds back economy\n\nApparently, you can\u2019t run an economy on taxpayers\u2019 money forever, according to\nScott Morrison. (, February 2). No doubt this was stated because he was\nworried about the long-term impact of running a deficit, especially on future\ngenerations. Such a pity that this concern is not extended to future citizens\nof the world thanks to his government\u2019s continued insistence on gas and other\nfossil fuels, which will overheat the planet for them. **Tom Meakin, Port\nMacquarie**\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s sanctimonious statement that he can\u2019t run the economy on\ntaxpayers\u2019 money forever is puzzling as this makes up about 93 per cent of\ngovernment revenue, in one form or another, so what alternatives does he have\nin mind? Can we hope that he and his fellow Coalition MPs now plan to dig deep\ninto their own pockets in an altruistic attempt to keep the economy afloat? Or\nperhaps he\u2019s planning a boost to revenue by using those recently disclosed\ndonations from grateful constituents. Then again, his comments could just be a\nbit more spin by Scotty from marketing. **Merona Martin, Meroo Meadow**\n\nThe Prime Minister is once again giving us this tired rubbish about burdening\nfuture generations with debt and you can\u2019t keep running the Australian economy\non taxpayers\u2019 money. We are now going to starve the unemployed again in the\nname of ideology. The Prime Minister is right to an extent; our government has\ngone into debt, but it has done nothing to stimulate our economy. I am afraid\nwe are, in fact, going to end up with a huge debt and an ongoing deep\nrecession. Our government is driven by an ideology that prevents them from\ndoing what is needed \u2013 stimulating demand by making money available to those\nwho will spend it, and spending borrowed money on investments that generate\nreturns. We have been very badly served. **Michael McMullan, Five Dock**\n\nThe PM says there are two ways to reduce carbon \u2013 technology and tax. He\nshould rethink the latter. Not all taxes are bad. Many taxes serve dual\npurposes \u2013 raising money for services while discouraging harmful activities\n(tobacco and alcohol). It took a long time for government to realise it was\nbetter to tax tobacco now rather than pay for the damage later. For carbon,\nlater is already here.  \nMuch as a tobacco tax encouraged people to minimise harm, so too do we need a\nsimilar win-win tax on carbon. **Hans Knutzelius, Balmain**\n\n### Pensive over future of pension\n\nIn light of recent debate on the superannuation guarantee, it is good to see\nthe aged pension receiving overdue attention (\u201c\u201d, February 2). What will\nfuture governments do long-term to prevent the old aged pension slipping\nfurther away so that a retiree has to be 70 to claim it? What incentives will\nbe provided to encourage retirees to continue to work part-time if they wish\nand to draw a pension? **Rod Leonarder, Roseville**\n\nThis Coalition government has said that the aged pension is welfare, not an\nentitlement. Given their punitive attitude to other welfare recipients, does\nanyone really think any Coalition government will maintain the aged pension at\na level that will provide for life\u2019s necessities? **Sandra Pertot, Diamond\nBeach**\n\n### Chamber of horrors\n\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry call for a return to the pre-\nCOVID dole rate (frozen since 1994) (\u201c\u201d, February 2) shows its true colours\nand the COVID-induced lies of \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. It shows once\nagain that public life can be broken into two groups: the \u201cenlargers\u201d and the\n\u201cpunishers and straighteners\u201d. The current union bus ad showing Morrison at\nthe wheel of a bus mowing down workers says it all. **Alan Carruthers,\nArtarmon**\n\nWhat is the role of the citizen in our society? Is it to simply work and\nconsume, or is there anything more? It would seem that worker/consumer is all\nthe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry believe we\u2019re worth. But if\nwe\u2019re a society, not just an economy, we need to have a broader view.  \nI have worked with unemployed people and their needs and stories are as\ndiverse as any other group in society. While our governing political parties\ncontinue to rely on the wealthiest corporations to gain power it\u2019s difficult\nto believe government will act with compassion. If, however, we want a good\nand fair society, government must end the punishment of the unemployed and\nincrease social security payments so that all of us can live decent lives.\n**Colin Hesse, Marrickville**\n\n### Wheels on the bus\n\nIf Craig Kelly can promote controversial theories then the CFMMEU can\nsatirically depict the Prime Minister running down workers and their rights in\na fictitious bus (\u2034\u201d, February 2). **Denis Goodwin, Dee Wh** y\n\nCoalition members failing to repudiate Craig Kelly\u2019s comments on using\nunproved drugs to treat COVID-19, I am reminded of the saying by Lieutenant\nGeneral David Morrison: \u201cthe standard you walk past is the standard you\naccept.\u201d We are in a sorry state when the behaviour of Kelly is apparently\nacceptable to most of Parliament. **Rob Siebert, Skenners Head**\n\n### Time to stand up to China\n\nHear, hear, Peter Hartcher (\u201c\u201d, February 2). His essay about calls for\nAustralia to toe a \u201cnuanced\u201d diplomatic line with China is dead on target.\nWhen have Australians ever been asked by their government to kneel before a\nbully? Those calling for us to back down to avoid making China angry appear to\nhave more than just sovereign interests at hand. Financial, perhaps? Doing the\nbest thing is not as important as doing the right thing. **Karl Fletcher,\nMudgee**\n\n### Mining dissent\n\nThat the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies\u2019 push to remove\ncommunity groups\u2019 right to mount legal challenges to major project approvals\nhas been rejected (\u201c\u201d, February 2) rightly channels the sound view that in our\ndemocracy (to paraphrase) it is important that no entity existing be not\nresponsible to the people. **Steve Ngeow, Chatswood**\n\n### Myanmar coup lessons\n\nThe military coup in Myanmar reminds us once again just how fragile democracy\ncan be (\u201c\u201d, February 2). The Myanmar army\u2019s claims of election fraud appear to\nbe as baseless as those in the US. Here, we can rail against our governments,\nboth state and federal, for their many shortcomings, but are fairly certain\nthat an election result will always be honoured. **Joan Brown, Orange**\n\nAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s only political crime is that she has been unsuccessful in\nmanaging the army to stay out of politics, free their people and return to\ntheir barracks, where they belong. **Mike Fogarty, Weston (ACT)**\n\n### Justice for Biloela family\n\nYour correspondent (, February 2) identifies the absurd criminality of our\ngovernment\u2019s treatment of the Biloela family. Is it time for us to have mass\nsilent vigils outside our capital city parliamentary buildings to demonstrate\nhow we feel about the ridiculous treatment given these poor people? **Anthony\nTucker, Leichhardt**\n\nPeter Dutton showed his displeasure at the WA Premier for imposing a lockdown\nat short notice. I hope he is aware that as minister of his portfolio, he has\nlocked down a number of refugees, at an enormous expense of taxpayer money.\n**Peng Ee, Castle Cove**\n\nWhile Labor is looking for issues to tackle the government with, go no further\nthan the Biloela family for a return to a normal Australian life. This is sure\nto be a winner with all the fair-minded populace we hear so much about from\nthe Opposition Leader. **Zuzu Burford, Heathcote**\n\nMy local member (Cook electorate) doesn\u2019t reply to my many emails regarding\nthe Sri Lankan family incarcerated on Christmas Island, except for\nacknowledging receipt of the emails. **Josephine Piper, Miranda**\n\n### EV come, EV go\n\nThe only time I suffer \u2033\u2063range anxiety\u2033\u2063 with my EV (, February 2) is when I\nstart thinking about travelling across the Nullarbor Plain. **Cornelius van\nder Weyden, Balmain East**\n\nWe can\u2019t have EVs because we will lose our weekends. In 2019 Scott Morrison\ntold us so. **Christiaan Goudkamp, Murwillumbah**\n\n### Golden greats\n\nGold is a great colour for the Wallabies (, February 2) as it might help them\ndistinguish a teammate to pass the ball to. **Denis Suttling, Newport Beach**\n\nYour correspondent states gold or yellow is a poor choice for the Wallabies\njersey and a dark colour would be better for rule infringements to be\noverlooked. My suggestion is dark purple, a colour reminiscent of sour grapes.\n**Barrington Salter, Neutral Bay**\n\n### Prickly threat\n\nAll there seems to be on the TV news each day are people getting virus jabs. I\nknow it\u2019s important but if I see another one I\u2019ll scream. **John Nickel, Noosa\nHeads**\n\nWhen the vaccine becomes available, we would have more success if we stopped\nreferring to it as \u201cthe jab\u201d. **Ray Smith, Kings Park**\n\n **The digital view**  \n **Online comment from the story that attracted the most reader feedback\nyesterday on _smh.com.au_**  \n  \nFrom **Praetorian** : \u2033\u2063He who aims at nothing.

{"title": "\u2018Forever changed\u2019: CEOs are dooming business travel - maybe for good", "article": "Business travel as we\u2019ve known it is a thing of the past. From Pfizer,\nMichelin and LG Electronics to HSBC and Deutsche Bank, businesses around the\nworld are signalling that new communications tools are making many pre-\npandemic-era trips history.\n\nTake Akzo Nobel, Europe\u2019s biggest paint maker, for instance. At its Amsterdam\nheadquarters, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Vanlancker has spent the past\nyear watching his manufacturing head, David Prinselaar, flap his arms, madly\ngesticulate and seemingly talk to himself while \u201cvisiting\u201d 124 plants by\ndirecting staff with high-definition augmented-reality headgear on factory\nfloors. A task that meant crisscrossing the globe in a plane before is now\ndone in a fraction of the time \u2014 and with no jet lag. For Vanlancker, there\u2019s\nno going back.\n\n\u201cTrips to drum up business could drop by a third, and internal meetings by\neven more,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for our wallets and\nhelps our sustainability targets. Our customers have had a year of training,\nso it\u2019s not a social no-no anymore to just reach out by video... There\u2019s an\nenormous efficiency element.\u201d\n\nA Bloomberg survey of 45 large businesses in the US, Europe and Asia shows\nthat 84 per cent plan to spend less on travel post-pandemic. A majority of the\nrespondents cutting travel budgets see reductions of between 20 per cent and\n40 per cent, with about two in three slashing both internal and external in-\nperson meetings. The ease and efficiency of virtual software, cost savings and\nlower carbon emissions were the primary reasons cited for the cutbacks.\nAccording to the Global Business Travel Association, spending on corporate\ntrips could slide to as low as $US1.24 trillion by 2024 from a pre-pandemic\npeak in 2019 of $US1.43 trillion.\n\nBusiness travel has \u201cforever changed,\u201d Greg Hayes, CEO of jet-engine maker\nRaytheon Technologies, said in July. About 30 per cent of normal commercial\nair traffic is corporate-related, but only half of that is likely mandatory,\nhe said. While the market may eventually recover, sophisticated communication\ntechnologies have \u201creally changed our thinking in terms of productivity,\u201d\nHayes said.\n\nHaving saved billions from slashed travel budgets during the pandemic with\nonly a marginal impact on operations, companies, banks, consulting firms and\ngovernment offices will be hard-pressed to explain why they\u2019d return to their\nold ways. Kit Kat chocolate-bar maker Hershey said the pandemic showed that\nonline meetings were a more efficient use of time and financial resources.\nCompanies like Pfizer are grappling with questions about what one accomplishes\nwith a trip that can\u2019t be done virtually, Tina Quattlebaum, its director of\nglobal travel operations, said at the GBTA Mid-Year Virtual Summit in July.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think business travel will ever return to 2019 levels,\u201d said Will\nHawkley, the global head of travel and leisure at KPMG. \u201cCorporates are\nlooking at their bottom-line, their environmental commitments, the demand from\nemployees for more flexible working and thinking: Why do I have to bring that\nback?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a blow to the airline and hospitality industries \u2014 already among the\nbiggest casualties of the pandemic. Business travellers, who buy premium-class\nor more-expensive refundable tickets, rang in as much as three-quarters of\nairlines\u2019 pre-pandemic profits while accounting for only 12 per cent of seats,\naccording to PwC. The hotels sector, which draws about two-thirds of its\nrevenue from business travellers, could see a dip of as much as 18 per cent by\n2022 as virtual meetings replace 27 per cent of corporate travel volumes, a\nMorgan Stanley study shows.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest airlines collectively lost a whopping $US126 billion in\n2020 and are set to lose another $US48 billion this year, according to the\nInternational Air Transport Association, their lobby. As they wrestle with\nthose losses and the huge debts racked up after coronavirus punctured a\ndecades-long boom in travel, the last thing airlines need is corporate\ncustomers cutting back. Carriers like Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Delta Air\nLines and American Airlines, with thousands of staff and overhead to support,\ndepend on business travellers returning.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this structural decrease in business travel will be enormous\nfor the industry, and especially for the airlines that are the most exposed to\nthis category of traveller,\u201d said Pascal Fabre, managing director in Paris for\nAlixPartners, a consulting firm.\n\nAirlines are trying to stay optimistic. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said about 80 per\ncent of the carrier\u2019s large corporate clients have indicated that as much as\n90 per cent of their pre-Covid business travel will eventually return.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to see a degradation in the aggregate of business\ndemand over time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe more people are connected in\nperson, the more opportunities are created. I don\u2019t see this being a\nsignificant body-blow to the industry as prognosticated by some.\u201d\n\nTravelling thousands of miles to meet with customers to discuss key issues\nacross a table or over a meal made business sense before the pandemic and that\nhasn\u2019t changed, said Warren East, the CEO of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which\nmakes aircraft engines.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has definitely taught people that some of the mad regular dashes\nacross the Atlantic hither and thither aren\u2019t necessary,\u201d he said, speaking at\na net-zero event on June 17. \u201cBut when you peel back beyond that superficial\nanalysis, you realise people were doing it because they thought it delivered\nreal benefit to them.\u201d\n\nThere may also be competitive pressures to keep flying, Air France-KLM CEO Ben\nSmith said in an interview. \u201cI hear many of our corporate customers saying\nthat the day they lose an account because they weren\u2019t somewhere face-to-face\nwill immediately bring them back to the way operations were before.\u201d\n\nAirlines are banking on a recovery sparked by pent-up demand after about 18\nmonths when executives couldn\u2019t visit customers \u2014 hopes that are being dented\nby the spread of the delta variant. Even if there is an initial burst of\nactivity, it will start to stabilise and the structural change to business\ntravel will become evident by around 2024, according to Fabre.\n\n\u201cIn the past, it was seen as a good thing to go to the other side of the world\nto shake someone\u2019s hand, but not anymore,\u201d Augustin de Romanet, the CEO of\nAeroports de Paris, which operates dozens of airports around the world, said\nin an interview. \u201cMany things that have been done by conference call during\nthe pandemic will stay that way, especially when it comes to far-flung\ncountries. This will be for costs and the environment as well as people\u2019s\nwellbeing.\u201d\n\nCompany executives travel for many reasons \u2014 from business development and\ncustomer support to trade shows, conferences and meetings with local staff.\nTrips for intra-company activities will likely bear the brunt of the cuts\n\u201cbecause client relationships aren\u2019t at stake,\u201d said AlixPartners\u2019 Fabre.\n\n\u201cWe have learned how to work, develop products, sign contracts without\ntravelling,\u201d he said.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s global head of Investment Banking Coverage and Advisory, Drew\nGoldman, said that while the bank\u2019s client-related business travel will return\nto about 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, trips for internal meetings will\nprobably be a shadow of what they were before \u2014 at 25 per cent to 30 per cent.\n\nVolkswagen is making employees jump through hoops before they can fly.\nInternal booking software steers them toward alternatives to flying, the most\ncarbon-intensive form of travel. They\u2019re also asked to justify why they can\u2019t\nconduct the business online. At French defence and tech giant Thales, \u201ctrips\nwill be for longer and probably less frequent in order to optimise costs,\nenvironmental impact and wellbeing,\u201d said CEO Patrice Caine.\n\nIn Singapore, United Overseas Bank, Southeast Asia\u2019s third-biggest bank, plans\nto cut its travel budget by as much as half, and will limit trips to cases\n\u201cwhere face-to-face interaction is essential,\u201d said Dean Tong, head of group\nhuman resources. On New York-based Marsh & McLennan\u2019s second-quarter earnings\ncall, CEO Dan Glaser said, \u201ccompanies, not just Marsh McLennan, will travel\nwith more purpose and will be more thoughtful about travelling.\u201d\n\nSophisticated technologies are enabling companies to do things they never\nimagined doing remotely. At French tire maker Michelin, new tools are already\neclipsing the automatic reflex to make a trip, CEO Florent Menegaux said in an\ninterview. The company recently used a drone for a virtual visit of its Campo\nGrande plant in Brazil by the top manufacturing brass in France. \u201cWe start\nmachines remotely, have used drones to visit factories and train people from\nhome,\u201d Menegaux said. \u201cWe will continue to travel because human bonds are\nabsolutely necessary to our activity, but we will most certainly have an\noverall reduction of about 20 per cent to 30 per cent in our travel costs.\u201d\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell has created online control rooms with interactive 3D\nsimulations of oil platforms and plants, giving engineers virtual access from\nhome. In Troy, Michigan, Kevin Clark, the CEO of Aptiv, a former car parts\nunit of General Motors, is using drones and Oculus augmented-reality headsets\nto show customers the performance and manufacturing run rates of plants in\nMexico, Hungary, or China.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t travel as much,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be more when we have to\ntravel people will travel, versus, it\u2019s nice to travel.\u201d\n\nFor most companies, cost savings will be the primary driver to scale back, but\ncarbon-footprint worries and employee wellbeing are not far behind, Fabre\nsaid.\n\nBusinesses globally are under pressure from investors and regulators to shrink\ntheir CO2 emissions. The European Commission rolled out an ambitious climate\nplan in July to force all industries to shift away from fossil fuels. Aviation\nhas long been a target even though it accounts for only about 2.4 per cent of\nglobal human-induced CO2 emissions. That\u2019s because the sector was growing\nrapidly before the pandemic and has other negative effects on the Earth\u2019s\nupper atmosphere.\n\n\u201cCompanies have acknowledged that reducing the level of flights is one way of\nreducing climate change,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, aviation director at advocacy\ngroup Transport & Environment. \u201cFor the next 10 years, the best way to reduce\nemissions from aviation is to fly less.\u201d\n\nAirlines are providing companies tools to blunt the impact of CO2 emissions\nwith carbon offsets and refreshing fleets with newer, more efficient planes.\nBut with the tons of carbon dioxide they spew, airlines can\u2019t do much to show\nthat flying is a sustainable way to get around. Hydrogen-fuelled planes and\nelectric commercial jetliners are decades away, and alternative aviation fuel\nisn\u2019t widely available and jacks up ticket prices.\n\nCarriers may have to modify aircraft configurations to cut business class\nseats and add more premium economy places. Premium economy costs less to\noperate than business class and takes up less space.\n\nAir France, for instance, is developing its so-called leisure-business\ncategory for passengers who buy premium-class tickets for holiday travel,\naccording to Steven Zaat, the group\u2019s CFO. Thirty-two Air France 777s are\nfitted with \u201cquick change\u201d systems that allow the airline to reduce the size\nof its business-class cabin. The airline is still confident about a rebound in\nbusiness travel, but \u201cwe can always reconfigure our planes if necessary,\u201d Zaat\nsaid in a Bloomberg TV interview.\n\nWhile airlines grapple with the possibility of fewer business customers, some\nof those clients are happy not to be zipping around the world all the time.\n\n\u201cA nice side effect of fewer long-haul business trips is less stress for the\npeople who fly,\u201d Hans-Ingo Biehl, the head of VDR, the German Business Travel\nAssociation, said in an interview. A study by the Baylor College of Medicine\nfound frequent fliers have the same cancer risk as obese people. Also,\ncompanies have found that jet lag hurts productivity.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of myths and fantasy about travel, but it\u2019s really very\ntiring,\u201d said Michelin CEO Menegaux. \u201cWe should do it only when it\u2019s\nabsolutely necessary. I travel a lot and I can tell you it\u2019s physically\ngruelling and takes a heavy toll.\u201d\n\n **Bloomberg**\n\n ** _The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day\u2019s trading._** ** _._**\n\n", "url": "/business/companies/forever-changed-ceos-are-dooming-business-travel-maybe-for-good-20210901-p58npt.html", "last_update": "2021-09-01T01:07:16Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Uni fee overhaul connotes shallow view of education", "article": "Your editorial makes a strong case for increased investment in all sorts of\neducation and training, rather than trying to steer students into degrees\nconsidered to have better job prospects (\u201c\u201d, June 20-21). It\u2019s interesting\nthat the Morrison government\u2019s pricing changes will hit business, law and arts\nstudents when Education Minister Dan Tehan has degrees in arts, foreign\naffairs and international relations (\"\", June 19). Seven of the last nine\nprime ministers were arts or social science graduates. It\u2019s no surprise that\nconservatives are usually wary of universities, as graduates are more likely\nto vote for progressive parties with strong policies on social justice and\nclimate change. - **James Moore, Kogarah**\n\nWithdrawal of government funding has already marginalised institutions like\nthe CSIRO, the ABC, the Australia Council for the Arts and their associated\ncultural and research programs. Now impoverished universities are expected to\nfocus on the development of skills as their primary purpose. We need a skilled\nworkforce but not at the expense of new ideas, informed debate and cultural\nenrichment. Whatever happened to Menzies\u2019 belief that a university education\nbased on the humanities is essential for civilisation to flourish? - **Tanya\nCrothers, Mosman**\n\nAs one of many angry arts graduates debating the devaluation of studies in\nhumanities, I would also argue that Minister Tehan\u2019s comment encouraging\nstudents to pick up skills in other disciplines and not \u201csilo\u201d their degree,\nis the opposite of what will actually happen (\"\", June 20-21). Any course with\nprescribed set subjects, such as many of the science degrees, are effectively\ndiscipline silos. I strongly suggest that the teaching of ethics and critical\nthinking should at the least be mandatory in such courses. - **Suzan Fayle,\nRozelle**\n\nTehan, like many so-called pragmatists, fails to understand the\nquintessentially vocational utility of humanities disciplines. Anyone in sales\nwho has a background in anthropology and sociology has the advantage of being\nable to contextualise a sales pitch based upon known traditions, customs and\nrituals of customers. Add psychology and you have the ultimate selling\nsuperstar. Philosophy, of course, is a fundamental workplace necessity. Pared\ndown, this discipline provides anyone on the corporate promotion ladder with\ndeadly skills. It goes almost without saying that history and geography are\nmore than handy when you are tempted to blow up artefacts that are at least\n40,000 years old. If the fees for any courses need to be reduced, it is\nobviously these. - **Mark d\u2019Arbon, Chittaway Bay**\n\nTim Soutphommasane echoes my disquiet regarding the overhaul of university\ncourses (\"\", June 20-21). Minister Tehan seems to value \"job relevant\"\ncourses. Is an understanding of history, logic, literature, philosophy and\ncritical thinking somehow not relevant in today's employment environment? I\nwould've thought, given the institutional failings detailed in recent royal\ncommissions, at least the study of ethics would be an essential prerequisite\nfor any qualification. Does the Minister fear the quiet folk may occasionally\nchallenge or question our political leadership? He and the government may need\na few lessons in respectful argument supported by robust evidence. Oh, wait.\nYou learn those skills by studying humanities and social sciences. -\n**Adrienne Berkman, Northbridge**\n\nThis has to be the most anti-female change to fees ever proposed. We now have\na majority female population among the students who are doing those degrees\nthat will get the biggest fee increases. I hope the Senate will be sensible\nand defer implementation of these fees for five years to give the current\ncohort certainty and allow the year 7 students time to switch tracks to the\nfavoured disciplines. All of those young women who were intending to study law\nor languages will be seriously disadvantaged. - **Alan Stanley, Upper\nCorindi**\n\nWe allow football crowds back but discourage protestors. We take advice from\nscientists on the pandemic but not on climate change. We give JobKeeper to\nout-of-work employees but not to freelancers in the arts. We subsidise\nhomeowners but not tenants. We support white citizens but not our Indigenous\npeople. And we favour practical degrees over the more free-thinking and\nesoteric courses. Australia, the not-so-clever country. - **Margaret Grove,\nAbbotsford**\n\nIt is good that the price has come down for some subjects but not at the\nexpense of the humanities. All graduates from whatever subject need some\nhumanities in their degree and not being forced to pay double the cost. What\nthe government is trying to do is social engineering at its worst. - **Laurie\nUrane, Haberfield**\n\nAustralia 2021. Welcome to the land of the philistines! - **Ann Brindle,\nBeverly Hills**\n\nI read that Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, had graduated from\nOxford University with a PPE degree: philosophy, politics and economics. It\nwas established in 1921 and is highly sought-after. This degree combination is\navailable here. A University of New South Wales website states it: \u201c\u2026 provides\ngraduates with a powerful combination of intellectual tools to understand and\nact in the world \u2026 and draws together the perspective of three crucial\nacademic disciplines to address contemporary national and global issues, such\nas justice, inequality and climate change.\u201d Perhaps this is the government\u2019s\nunderlying reason to inhibit students from studying many arts subjects, let\nalone afford a humanities degree. If anything speaks more of blinkered vision\nand thinking, and using income to limit student\u2019s abilities and contributions,\nthen this is it. It is Orwellian in its assault on our basic freedoms and\nparticipation. Significantly, it is also discriminatory against those socially\nand economically disadvantaged, many of whom are in minorities. - **Jennifer\nFergus, Manly**\n\nMany universities are working closely with industry stakeholders to develop\ngraduate capability frameworks that equip students for a progressively better\nfuture. Critical, ethical thinking and global citizenship \u2013 along with\nenterprise skills \u2013 coexist in such frameworks yet, to me, the government's\nnew move views capability from a lens that inhibits our development as a\nprogressive country. - **Chris Bilsland, Lane Cove**\n\nTo reinforce Richard Flanagan\u2019s argument that \u201cnothing is more helpful in\npreparing the road to authoritarianism\u201d than doubling the cost of humanities\ndegrees, such an action will also act as a disincentive for individuals\nundertaking history teaching, as this requires a double degree in teaching and\nhumanities. Such a decision significantly concerns me, as what the current\ntearing down of racist historical structures tells us is that what we need\nmost in schools are passionate history teachers who are going to actively work\nto decolonise their classrooms, question the dominant hegemonies of the\ncurriculum, and place minority historical voices prominently within\neducational spaces. - **Amelia Pitney, Pymble**\n\nWhy is it that our governments (particularly conservative ones) consider\neducation at all levels as a cost to government and taxpayers? They know full\nwell that good education is the cornerstone of a free, egalitarian and\nproductive society and as such benefits us all. What will it take to convince\nour leaders that education for all is a productive investment, made by our\ngovernment, on behalf of the entire nation? - **Tony Heathwood, Kiama Downs**\n\nMy most valuable life and career lessons at UNSW over 40 years ago came not\nfrom the technical subjects of the civil engineering degree, but from the\ncompulsory humanities half-subjects that I chose: philosophy, history,\npsychology and, especially, applied logic. - **Peter Allen, Castle Cove**\n\nCoincidence that in your Careers page (\"\", June 20) you feature visual arts\nteacher, Miriam Fee. In it she describes the transferable skills including\n\"starting points, brainstorming, researching\", the list went on. Why should\nthese students have to pay more? - **Gail Grogan, Constitution Hill**\n\nThroughout my many years as a lecturer in accounting I consulted with the\nprofession as to their chief concern about the skills of new graduates. Time\nand again their criticism was that they could not write a coherent one page\nsummary of financial reports. Academics have tried to raise this aspect of our\nstudents development by setting essay assignments. But this is not enough to\ncounter their lack of literacy. They need to study the humanities. - **Cecilia\nSpence, Bawley Point**\n\n### Steamed up over Powerhouse loss\n\nI am close to tears after reading Elizabeth Farrelly\u2019s article (\"\", June\n20-21). Clearly no Morrison miracle will materialise to prevent our beloved\nand marvellous Powerhouse Museum meeting the same sad fate as so much else of\nour rich heritage. The pattern of scandalous and wilful destruction continues\nand flies in the face of the people's wishes. The cynic in me also notes the\nPowerhouse closing date is the day before the start of the school holidays,\nneatly preventing last-chance visits which would have given our young people\nlife-long memories of a disappearing past. - **Joy Nason, Mona Vale**\n\nHaving been a loyal Powerhouse Museum member for well over 20 years, I was\nsaddened and angered to think that this weekend\u2019s visit may well be my last.\nMy sons developed a genuine love of science thanks to our many visits to their\nfavourite venue. If ever there was a time when young people need to become\naware of the nature of things scientific, now is that time. By all means\nconstruct a new cutting-edge facility at Parramatta, but please save the\nPowerhouse. - **Steven Baker, Engadine**\n\nThe fate of the Boulton and Watt steam engine is in the balance. Originally\ninstalled in a London brewery in 1785, this workhorse of the Industrial\nRevolution came to Sydney by ship in 1888, only to lie dormant in boxes for\n100 years until reassembled and fired up by the Museum Of Applied Arts and\nSciences at Ultimo in 1988. What a sacrilege it would now be to pack this\njewel of the steam age back into boxes. - **Ian Ferrier, Paddington**\n\nI was standing watching a demonstration of the Boulton and Watt steam engine a\ncouple of years ago. Beside me was a suited English gentleman who turned to me\nand said \u201cI\u2019m from Leeds University and we don\u2019t have one of these\u201d. -\n**Marcia Horvai, Pennant Hills**\n\nThe Premier and her band of philistine ministers will be forever known as the\nperpetrators of one of the world\u2019s most despicable acts of cultural vandalism.\nAlmost as terrible as the WA government authorising the destruction of\n46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous sites. - **Nick Sharp, Warrawong**\n\nNo other sites were considered for the Powerhouse yet there is a wonderful\nplace crying out for a new role. Callan Park is empty and neglected. The stone\nbuildings there are beautiful and enormous \u2014 more than enough for three\nPowerhouse museums \u2014 and it is only minutes from the CBD. Refurbishment would\ncome at a fraction of the cost of the move to the proposed ghastly edifice at\nParramatta. - **Hans Knutzelius, Balmain**\n\nHow disappointing that the _Herald_ and Elizabeth Farrelly continue to\ncampaign against a tier 1 cultural facility in Western Sydney. Our \"friends\"\nin the east will just have to discover there is a diverse communities of\nSydneysiders far beyond Ultimo that deserve access to a world-class cultural\nfacility. Bring on the Powerhouse Parramatta! - **Chris Taylor, Lakemba**\n\n### Way off track with fare hikes\n\nOh, you have to love our quirky state government (\"\", June 20-21). When so\nmany other cities have introduced congestion taxes on private cars entering\nthe CBD in peak hour, our government has come straight out of left field with\na tax on public transport in peak hour. Raising fares at this stage looks more\nlike a revenue grab than a health measure. - **John Mizon, Collaroy**\n\nMost Monday-to-Friday commuters will face a public transport price hit from\nJuly 6, but it doesn't compare with the 287 per cent price hike in the cost of\nadult Sunday fares. Adult fares will rise from a capped $2.80 (all day travel)\nto $8.05 (and children's fares will go from $2.80 to $4). This means a family\nof four will be paying $24.10 instead of $11.20 for a Sunday outing on our\npublic transport system. People may stay home rather than exploring Sydney and\nits environs or return to using their cars. - **Evelyn Palmer, Vaucluse**\n\n### Mad about the Boyd\n\nBen Boyd brought his first shipment of Islanders to NSW in 1847 (, June\n20-21). The slave trade had been abolished in the British empire in 1807 and\nslavery in 1833. Even in the context of his time, Boyd\u2019s actions were illegal.\nStatues provide a very selective picture of Australia\u2019s history: that of a\npredominantly white, wealthy and male perspective. Even though the context in\nwhich they were built was racist and misogynistic, by maintaining such a\npitiful imbalance, we perpetuate a society that limits our perception of what\nit is to be worthy of commemoration. - **Isobel Page, Hornsby Heights**\n\nBoyd was controversial in his own time (, June 20-21). Slavery was technically\nillegal in Australia and Boyd's charitable works were funded by defrauding the\nRoyal Bank of Australia. As with Queen's Birthday Honours, statues are often\ngiven to the wrong person for the wrong reason. If removing them is rewriting\nhistory, then so be it. Sometimes the written record needs to be corrected. -\n**Ben Aveling, Alexandria**\n\nBoyd's behaviour is not merely unacceptable today, but was deemed so by the\nNSW Legislative Council in his lifetime. Yet a public park was named in his\nhonour in 1971 \u2013 120 years after he permanently left Australia. - **Al\nSvirskis, Mount Druitt**\n\n### Size doesn't matter\n\nThat offended \"small percentage\", Rosemary O\u2019Brien (, June 20-21), has been\nhere for about 60,000 more years than the rest of us. They had their land\nstolen from them, they have had their children ripped from them, and they even\nfought for this nation in world wars at a time when they were not deemed\neligible for citizenship. To cap it off, they are forced to reckon with an\nAustralia Day celebration each year that reminds them of all these wrongs. I\ndon\u2019t care how small the percentage is, it\u2019s the height of absurdity that we\ncontinue to do nothing to remedy any of this. It makes me deeply, deeply\nashamed. - **Angela Namoi, Crows Nest**\n\nThere is a statue of the famous Aboriginal woman Mum Shirl (Shirley Smith) at\nRedfern beside St Vincent\u2019s Catholic Church (, June 20-21). Mum Shirl was an\nAboriginal activist, a powerful advocate for Indigenous rights and welfare.\nThe statue was done by sculptor Bill Clements. - **Esmey Herscovitch,\nVaucluse**\n\n### Leave it a-loan\n\nThe soap opera playing out in the District Court between friends who fell out\nover a trivial loan is nothing if not amusing (\"\", June 20-21). But I do hope\nthe real costs of this stoush will be fully met by the antagonists, not by the\ncitizens of NSW. Why did this frivolity ever reach a court and require a\n12-person jury to spend several days listening to arguments about a loan of\nless than $25,000? - **Philip Bell, Bronte**\n\n### Hothousing smothers\n\nThere is one omission from Malcolm Knox's account of the decline in numbers of\nthose playing cricket in his excellent article on the sport's malaise (\"\",\nJune 20-21 _)._ Selfish, tunnel-visioned administrators in many sports, but\nmost conspicuously the football codes, have extended their seasons so that by\nthe time they finish primary school, capable young players are locked into a\nsingle sport to their developmental and social detriment. The old patterns of\nsummer cricket/winter football, netball or hockey have been broken,\ndisadvantaging all sports and the people who play them. - **Gary Ireland,\nElderslie**\n\n### Time for tech check\n\nWe\u2019re seeing an increasing number of children at risk of significant harm (\"\",\nJune 20-21). Why are things so different now? Reporting of child maltreatment\nmight be up because we\u2019re more aware of child abuse. But I also suspect\nsomething else has changed \u2013 the extent to which technology use is affecting\nthe ability of parents to attend to their children. I am not saying that\nsmartphones are the boogie man but, they must be a significant factor.\nEverywhere I look these days, I\u2019m seeing parents buried in their devices (not\nlooking at their young children) and kids craning their necks to get the\nattention they yearn for. I suspect this lack of connection goes some way to\nexplain why some parents may be finding it harder to act more kindly towards\ntheir children. - **Michael Hawton, Byron Bay**\n\n### PR's time has come\n\nFrequently, factionalism has given rise to the perversion of democracy,\nbranch-stacking and various forms of skulduggery in both major parties. The\npossibility of more diverse democratic representation through proportional\nrepresentation would remove these undesirable features and lead to much\ngreater transparency. Its advantages, especially the \"party list\" system used\nin 89 countries, in which voters have just one vote, are far superior to the\nexisting system. No pork-barrelling, no byelections, multi-member electorates\nand majority government. Really, how much longer are Australians prepared to\nsuffer the existing political mess? - **Klaas Woldring, Pearl Beach**\n\n### A bridge too far-fetched\n\nProviding inducements for students to move from the humanities to more\npractical, economy- boosting subjects could have its problems (\"\", June\n20-21). If a theological aspirant switches to engineering so he can create\nbridges, will speeding motorists be required to have faith that the bridges\nactually exist in a physical form? - **Dave Watts, Avalon**\n\nSo the government wants the next generation of baristas to have STEM degrees?\n- **Alex Jones, Kirribilli**\n\nTo borrow a phrase from George Santayana, those who seek to make the past 113\nper cent more expensive \"are condemned to repeat it\u201d. - **Daniel Fleming,\nSurry Hills**\n\nNot long ago, the government's mantra was \"we want lifters, not leaners\". Now,\nby cutting funding to the arts, the mantra is \"we want doers, not thinkers\". -\n**Ian Brennan, Wareemba**\n\n### An alliterative appellation\n\nPeter Hull of Hat Head should change his first name to Harry so he would\nbecome Harry Hull of Hat Head (, June 20-21). He would then join Peter Pitt of\nPotts Point as a champion of alliteration. - **Peter Kamenyitzky, Castle\nHill**\n\n### Royal address\n\nI'm a republican who lives in Prince Street. Not happy (, June 20-21). - **Ian\nFactor, Mittagong**\n\n### Priorities in perspective\n\nThe goal of privileged residents of Sydney is to have a view of water,\nsparkling in the sunlight, for which some will battle tooth and nail. For many\nin several parts of the world, the goal is to have a view of clean, safe water\ncoming out of a tap, for which they also battle, but mostly in vain (\u201c\", June\n20-21). **Joan Brown, Orange**\n\n  *  ** **To submit a letter to** ** _The Sydney Morning Herald_** **, email.

{"title": "What matters to kids in a pandemic? Life lessons, not maths", "article": "What have you learnt about your child\u2019s education during the COVID-19\npandemic?\n\nIf former teacher-turned-author Gabbie Stroud were to pose this question to\nparents, there would be no one correct answer or end-of-term test.\n\nIt's a topic we digest over lunch of a dozen oysters each from her hometown,\nMerimbula, on the NSW South Coast. Her approach is multi-pronged \u2014 like the\n\"weaponry\", as she calls it, we use to attack our oysters.\n\nFirstly, Stroud is eager to make the distinction between home schooling, and\nlearning from home, which is what most students attempted for the early part\nof this school year. She hopes caregivers have a new-found appreciation for\nschool teachers' dedication.\n\nPerhaps, she proffers, parents should reframe this question with another\nquestion: \"What matters?\"\n\n\"It's such a good question to apply to anything in education,\" she says. \"So\noften we're in pursuit of what works, what will get the kids reading, what\nwill get the best results. But everything works somewhere and nothing works\neverywhere. So a better question is always: what matters?\"\n\nShe advised this approach on the ABC's _Q and A_ program mid-pandemic, at the\nsame time as the launch of her second book _Dear Parents,_ a series of letters\nto parents pointing out their responsibility as their children's primary\neducators.\n\nShe's become something of the \"token teacher\" these days, trotted out on prime\ntime, panels and podcasts on education, although it's nearly six years since\nshe has taught in a classroom.\n\n\"When they reflect back on this, our kids are probably not going to remember\nthe units of work that their teacher sent through, but what they learnt is how\nwe deal with a crisis,\" she says.\n\n\"That is a massive life skill. These are the lessons of this pandemic, and\nthat's what matters right now.\"\n\nWhat matters at our Zoom lunch is the plump produce of the Bega Valley sitting\nbefore us. In Sydney, my dozen natural Merimbula oysters with vinaigrette are\nserved on a rainy day indoors at my local pub, the Coogee Pavilion.\n\nStroud is dining outdoors under a brilliant blue Sapphire Coast sky, feasting\non half natural, half Japanese (pickled ginger, cucumber and wasabi aioli)\noysters. As she pops one into her mouth, she proclaims:\"That tastes of the\nocean just near Bar Beach\" (a beach on Merimbula Lake known for its rare\nemerald oysters).\n\nMost people in this pretty tourist destination know Wheelers Seafood\nRestaurant and Oyster Bar on the road into Pambula, and increasingly its\nresident writer and \"recovering\" teacher. Even before Stroud wrote her best-\nselling memoir _Teacher_ about her struggle to keep the heart in teaching,\nstrangers would yell out her name and approach her in the street for a hug.\nThey weren\u2019t exactly strangers: it just took some time to recognise the adult\nfaces of the former primary school pupils she has taught over the 20 years she\nhas lived in the area. She loves these interactions.\n\n\u201cEvery time a student I\u2019ve taught stops me to say hello, I feel like a candle\nthat\u2019s just been lit,\u201d she wrote in her 2018 book, which teachers bought by\nthe bucketloads, tearing up while reading then writing to tell her she\u2019d just\ntold their story.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, you never really know the impact that you're having or the work\nthat you're doing has value \u2026 It's an investment that you put in for years\nthen it pays off some time later when students come to you and tell you the\nimpact you had on them.\n\n\"I really think the most important teaching I ever did was to listen. When\nthey wanted to tell me about the puppies that had been born at home or the\nbook they had read.\n\n\"I just listened to their lives and their stories ... something really\npowerful happens when people listen.\u201d\n\nWe raise a glass of champagne to one of Stroud\u2019s favourite teachers: author\nJesse Blackadder, who died the day before we dined and who had taken Stroud\nunder her wing as a fledgling writer. Stroud, who turns 43 next Saturday, is\nthe youngest of five raised in Jindabyne.\n\nA decade younger than her older siblings, she had a relatively solitary\nchildhood with an imaginary friend called Ankle, dreamt up by her overactive\nimagination. Her farmer father ran a ski equipment enterprise, her mother\nworked at the local caravan park.\n\nShe never lost sight of her inner child, so teaching was a natural career\nchoice, which took her all around the world from Britain to Canada, with her\nhusband Matthew, who she'd met in her final year of school.\n\nHer path from teacher to author begin with the 2016 publication of an essay in\nthe _Griffith Review,_ along the theme of \"fixing the system\".\n\nStroud had taken some time off teaching because she was burnt out\nprofessionally and personally. Her marriage had crumbled, she was raising two\nyoung daughters, working ridiculous hours not just marking and preparing for\nclass but also in preparing students for NAPLAN, and complying with often-\nfrustrating educational bureaucracy.\n\nAfter publication of her essay on education, a Walkley nomination followed, as\ndid a book contract. Then came an appearance at the 2016 Byron Bay Writers\nFestival, where she met Blackadder.\n\n\"I was giving a long rant when part-way through, the audience in this packed\ntent started to applaud. I thought Magda Szubanski must have walked in \u2014 then\nI had this incredible moment when I realised they were applauding what I had\nto say,\" she says.\n\n\"I was so overcome, I started to cry and said, 'Don't applaud me because I'm\njust saying what all teachers are thinking and feeling.' It was a life-\nchanging moment when you realise you have a voice.\"\n\nShe's used that voice to question the conventional wisdom of the day,\nespecially standardised tests such as NAPLAN, taking inspiration from Hans\nChristian Andersen's classic _The Emperor's New Clothes._\n\n _\"_ Sometimes I feel like that little kid who says to the emperor, 'You've\ngot no clothes on.' I feel like I'm not saying anything extraordinary; I'm\njust saying what I see as the truth in teaching.\n\n\"If there's anything good to come out of this pandemic, it is the scrapping of\nNAPLAN \u2014 if we had suggested scrapping it earlier in the year, it would have\nbeen like some one suggesting we remove the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\"People would have been up in arms. I'm really hoping post pandemic that we\nfind ourselves in a world where NAPLAN is just a distant memory.\"\n\nHer first book is peppered with pearls of wisdom she learnt from fellow\nteachers: \"There's no such thing as a bad kid, only bad behaviour\" and\n\"Teaching is all about relationships\".\n\n\"I believe there's a certain magic that happens in teaching, and then to be\ntold how to do that magic by people who aren't magicians, who've never done\nmagic, it's insane,\" she tells me over her second course \u2014 crispy slow-cooked\npork belly salad \u2014 while I continue on my oysters with a side of chips.\n\nShe also recounts the kindness and compassion of one of her childhood teachers\nat the worst moment in her life.\n\nIn Year 8, two weeks before she turned 13, Stroud's brother died by suicide.\nHer English teacher, Mrs Dee, called to encourage her to write out her pain.\n\n\"She saw something in me that wasn't something my parents had put there; it\nwas something that was unique and special to me. She encouraged me and I felt\nvalidated,\" she says.\n\nThe current edition of the _Griffith Review_ contains the heartbreakingly\nhonest account of her brother's death. (If _Teacher_ made you cry, this will\nmake you sob.)\n\n\" _Teacher_ was looking back at the loss of my brilliant career, and writing\nit helped me realise that it's a system that's fundamentally broken; it's not\nme that's broken.\"\n\nShe misses the small dramas of the schoolyard and banter of the staffroom, but\ndoubts she will return to teaching. (\"What principal would have me?\")\n\nNor is she interested in working in policy. She is a writer now, trying her\nhand at chick-lit, a school related rom-com, and doing her best to co-parent\nOlivia, 11 and Sophia, 9. She has a pact with her ex-husband; he does the\ntalking at parent/teacher meetings. \"Sometimes teachers totally fan-girl me\nuntil they realise I'm a garden variety dickhead,\" she jokes.\n\nHer hot beverage has gone cold, but returning to what matters, Stroud says a\nchild will remember how you made them feel, not what you said in class.\n\n\"The thing that I wanted to impress upon every student that came into my\nclassroom was that they matter, that they're important and precious, and have\nvalue.\"\n\nWhen I call to pay the bill, Jacqui Smith, who owns Wheelers, assures me the\noyster harvest this year, once threatened by ash from this year's bushfires,\nwas saved by a king tide. Stroud, whose ex-husband still runs apartments in\nthe region, wants to encourages teachers to take a break this upcoming school\nholidays. Perhaps to her piece of paradise on the NSW South Coast \u2013 to remind\nteachers, they matter too.\n\n\"What I find absolutely extraordinary is the way that teachers will lift you\nup. When I wrote my first book, I kind of felt a little bit of a failure, as\nthough I couldn't quite make it in this career.\n\n\"Then all these teachers just got behind me and said, 'Thank you, you're\nextraordinary and you have done a great thing for us.' Several principals got\nin touch to tell me, 'You're still a teacher \u2014 you're just teaching a\ndifferent audience now'.\"\n\n **Wheelers Restaurant, 162 Arthur Kaine Drive, Pambula.

{"title": "Game on: artist loose in the State Library concocting wild fantasies", "article": "****Art can never be \u2018fake news\u2019 \u2013 it is by definition a work of the\nimagination, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t imitate reality, can\u2019t indulge in\nforms of masquerade and impersonation. It\u2019s this twilight zone between truth\nand fiction that fascinates Hadyn Wilson, the 2020 artist-in-residence at the\nState Library of NSW.\n\nThe fruit of that residency is the exhibition, _Fake Truths: An Historical\nNovel_ in the Amaze Gallery. To get there one must walk through the library\u2019s\nbrilliant, jam-packed salon hang of its extensive collection of paintings, a\npleasure in its own right.\n\nWilson promises us both paintings and stories but there\u2019s much more to this\ncompact, tricky show. The artist has made good use of his residency, scouring\nthe permanent collection for images, documents and items of \u201crealia\u201d that give\nus a tantalising glimpse into the lives of historical figures. His subjects\nare a mix of the well known and the unknown. In 22 small \u201cstories\u201d arranged in\nvitrines he combines real historical data with his own imaginary additions.\n\nSome of these additions seem completely plausible, others are fantastic.\nWilson records meetings that never happened and conversations that never took\nplace. He has written letters that throw new light on famous figures \u2013 if only\nthey were genuine. Literary historians would love to have evidence that Henry\nLawson\u2019s passionate praise of mateship was really sublimated homosexuality (as\nManning Clark argued). And wouldn\u2019t it be great to find a letter that threw a\nspotlight on the relationship between artists George Lambert and Thea Proctor?\n\nWilson does the detective work and, if necessary, manufactures his own\nevidence. His bogus letters and small paintings are supplemented by diverse\nitems that add credibility to his stories. He is well aware that a successful\nlie always contains a kernel of truth.\n\nWilson\u2019s most extravagant flight of fancy takes off from an early photo of a\nlittle girl named Ada Windle, who died in 1849, at the age of six. He imagines\nAda living an impossibly long life, becoming a major advocate for women\u2019s\nrights, acting as a friend and facilitator for every female high achiever.\nIt\u2019s the same order of fantasy as Bernard Smith\u2019s claim that the potential\nPicasso of Australian art may have perished on the battlefields of the Somme.\nSuch things are always possible, though hardly likely. Picasso fought all his\nbattles in the studio.\n\n _Fake Truths_ is not an exhibition for those who expect works of art to\nstimulate an immediate, emotional reaction. It\u2019s based on intensive research\nin the library\u2019s archives undertaken by Wilson and his assistant, Pru Smith.\nEach object has been subject to much thought and discussion, backed up by\nsupplementary reading.\n\nSome of these associations are included in the \u2018stories\u2019 that accompany each\ndisplay. A small painting by World War 1 artist, George Colville, inspired\nWilson to quote Isaac Rosenberg\u2019s brutal poem, _Dead Man\u2019s Dump_ (1917). A\npiece of a clerical collar retrieved from a beach links to Henry David\nThoreau\u2019s description of a shipwreck of 1849. Other items have prompted\nresponses drawn from science or natural history. Story 5 includes a list of\n132 endangered marine or aquatic species.\n\nSome objects have prompted Wilson to write a lengthy narrative, reconstructing\nevents and dialogues that _might_ have taken place. These texts, which may be\nread in the room brochure, appear in the cases in the form of books,\nsuggesting they are only extracts of much longer works. These _faux_\npublications are as convincing \u2013 or misleading - as a series of handwritten\nletters, folded and discoloured. There are also short films that may be\naccessed online.\n\nA brief, unusually saucy story of 1933 called _The Bath_ , ties author Henry\nHandel Richardson to the fashionable illustrator, Dora Jarrett, and the\nfirebrand publisher, P.R.Stephensen. This connection had only to be found, not\ninvented. By contrast, Hans Heysen\u2019s love of trees joins him to present-day\nGerman naturalist, Peter Wohlleben, and the spiritualist, Alfred William\nEustace (1820-1907), who painted landcapes on gum leaves: three men of\ndifferent eras, united by a shared passion.\n\nAn even more bizarre story links Hanna and Rudolf Lemberg, German Jews who\nbecame Quakers; painter Gladys Owen; and Rupert the Bear, who gets embroiled\nin a philosophical discussion with his companions. Here one sees Wilson\nindulging in what Goethe called \u201celective affinities\u201d.\n\nThose who have the patience to sample all the stories and puzzle out the\nassociations will discover an encyclopaedic overview of Australian history.\nYet Wilson is not content to merely collect historical anecdotes. The greater\nambition is to reveal the subjective nature of our understanding of the past:\nour tendency to read stories according to our own preoccupations and\nprejudices. He recognises we are less concerned with issues of proof and\nfalsification than with the appeal of a really good, salacious yarn. We fall\ninto the habit of treating historical figures as celebrities whose secrets are\nrevealed by the gossip columns. People who have never read a poem by Henry\nLawson would love to find out he was gay.\n\nIn his own small paintings incorporated within these displays Wilson makes\ncopies of works from the library\u2019s collection, adding significant details that\nchange the emphasis of an image. He puts Norman Lindsay\u2019s nudes beneath a\ncontemporaneous painting by Mondrian and poses Frank Hinder\u2019s mother, Enid\nMarguerite Pockley, in a lace-collared dress, in front of a modernist picture\nby her son. In many pictures we see a ghost-like reflection of Wilson\u2019s own\nface, signposting his dual roles as observer and creator.\n\nThis habitual game-playing will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but as a sustained\nexercise of visual and verbal wit it\u2019s a remarkable achievement. _Fake Truths_\nis the kind of exhibition that should appeal to readers of Alberto Manguel, a\nwriter who is both a literary archivist and a novelist. Or perhaps to fans of\nBritish artist, Tom Phillips, who made a 36-year-long art project from a\nsingle Victorian novel chosen at random. Such figures combine creativity with\nthe passion of the antiquarian. Universally curious they find \u2013 or forge -\nconnections in the most unlikely places.\n\nIt\u2019s a game with a serious intent: namely to stimulate our critical faculties,\nto ask us to become more aware of the highly motivated ways we look at works\nof art or interpret historical events. Wilson is implicitly challenging the\naura of scientific objectivity attached to museums and libraries, showing that\nall displays come with a raft of cultural assumptions. As a pantomime that\nmingles historical research with pure fantasy, _Fake Truths_ leaves us\nwondering just how much fiction lies undisclosed in the versions of history we\naccept as fact.\n\n _ **Fake Truths: An Historical Novel,**_ ** _Paintings & Stories_ by Hadyn\nWilson, ****State Library of NSW, until July 11**\n\n", "url": "/culture/art-and-design/game-on-artist-loose-in-the-state-library-concocting-wild-fantasies-20210531-p57wsa.html", "last_update": "2021-06-02T04:07:25Z", "source": "SMH"},

{"title": "More than 72% of Aussies 'prefer Obama'", "article": "More than 72 per cent of Australians preferred Barack Obama ahead of John\nMcCain as the next US president, a new poll has found.\n\nUMR Omnibus, which tracked the opinions of 1,000 Australians in the nine-month\nlead-up to the US election, said the numbers choosing Senator Obama over\nSenator McCain had increased by 13 per cent since February.\n\nAfter starting out with 59 per cent support against Senator McCain's 16 per\ncent, Senator Obama last week finished with 724 respondents saying they\npreferred him over the Republican candidate.\n\nJust 90 said they preferred Senator McCain.\n\nUMR managing director John Utting said the researcher's polls and focus group\nworkshop of Australians aged over 18 had shown most believe Senator Obama will\nhave a positive impact on the world.\n\nAsked \"What do you think would be different under Barack Obama?\", those\nsupporting his election said he was young and fresh with new ideas and would\nprovide better leadership for the US.\n\nThey said he would be more tolerant, bring about much needed change, have a\nbetter approach to domestic and international policies and place less focus on\nwar.\n\nUMR managing director John Utting said Australians' goodwill towards Obama had\nobviously been assisted by his \"clean and neat campaign, with barely a\nstumble\".\n\n\"The real expertise will be required after inauguration,\" Mr Utting said.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd may have some informal contact with US\npresident-elect Barack Obama when he visits Washington next week, Foreign\nMinister Stephen Smith says.\n\nMr Rudd, as one of the G20 leaders, will be taking part in discussions on the\nglobal financial crisis.\n\nAustralian government officials are requesting time with Senator Obama to\nallow Mr Rudd to offer congratulations.\n\n\"There may be some informal contact between president-elect Obama and some of\nthose (G20) leaders,\" Mr Smith told Sky News.\n\n\"Americans ... they're very conscious of the transitional arrangements.\n\n\"And traditionally, whilst there is a transitional plan, the president-elect\ntakes a pretty low profile.\"\n\nThe Bush administration was not a caretaker government between now and Senator\nObama's inauguration on January 20, Mr Smith said.\n\nGiven the role of both Senator Obama and Republican candidate John McCain in\nadministration negotiations on the financial crisis there may be an earlier\nrole for the president-elect, he said.\n\n\"It may well be that president-elect Obama's transitional team has a much\ngreater role in the on-going global financial crisis deliberations and\npossibly Senator Obama himself.\n\n\"But the tradition has been that the president-elect waits until inauguration\nday ... before starting that fully-fledged contact with other nations'\nleaders.\"\n\nAboriginal leader Patrick Dodson hopes Australia will one day follow the\nUnited States' lead by electing a black person to the nation's top job.\n\nMr Dodson, who will receive the 2008 Sydney Peace Prize Thursday night, said\nhe hoped an Aborigine could one day mirror US President-elect Barack Obama's\nsuccess.\n\n\"I think anything is possible in a democracy,\" Mr Dodson told ABC television.\n\n\"We have got Aboriginal leaders now ... at the local government levels, there\nare Aboriginal leaders in the parliaments, we've got an Aboriginal woman who's\nthe deputy leader in the Northern Territory assembly.\n\n\"So there are many Aboriginal people who are engaging in this public arena.\n\n\"I would hope that, one day, yes we do have an Aboriginal person in the\nparliament, but also at the level of prime minister, or senior ministers.\"\n\nThe Sydney Peace Prize is the only international peace prize awarded in\nAustralia.\n\nPrevious award recipients include former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\nMary Robinson and Swedish diplomat and nuclear disarmament advocate Dr Hans\nBlix.\n\n", "url": "/national/more-than-72-of-aussies-prefer-obama-20081106-5iul.html", "last_update": "2008-11-05T22:47:08Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Australia demands bushfire exemption in carbon treaty", "article": "Peat bogs in Germany, New Zealand firs and North American forests will likely\nallow industrialized countries to lower carbon emissions while still burning\ncoal and oil, according to a draft United Nations document.\n\nAustralia is demanding that emissions from natural disasters, such as bush\nfires, not be counted in its tally.\n\nNegotiators at climate-change talks in Bonn are proposing that carbon stored\nand absorbed by forests, soil and peat bogs in richer nations be included as\npart of national targets for cutting CO2, a document obtained by Bloomberg\nNews showed.\n\nAmerican Electric Power and Germany's RWE are among the utilities that may\nbenefit by paying less for emissions permits.\n\nThe plan could ''significantly'' improve those countries' abilities to claim\nthey are tackling climate change without having to scale back the use of\ndirtier coal, oil and natural gas, said Paul Winn, a climate-change expert at\nGreenpeace.\n\n''Basically, this would be a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card,'' Winn said. ''Those\ncountries could go on polluting the atmosphere and say `hey, we're meeting our\ntargets.'''\n\nBillions of tons of carbon are stored in the forests of Canada, the US and\nRussia as well as in peat bogs, cropland and other areas across Australia, New\nZealand and Europe. By including the CO2 stored in vegetation in global-\nwarming targets, industrialized nations could burn more fossil fuels and\npossibly buy fewer emission permits earned by developing countries for\nwindmills, solar panels and protecting forests.\n\n''These land-use emissions are not insignificant,'' Jonathan Pershing, deputy\nchief climate negotiator for the US delegation, said in an interview. US\nforests alone absorb the equivalent of about 10 per cent of the country's\nentire output from the use of fuels such as coal that pollute the atmosphere.\n\nGlobally, cropland accounts for about 17 per cent of emissions, according to\nThe Nature Conservancy, which like Greenpeace is an environmental advocacy\ngroup. Cutting down trees in tropical forests and leaving them to rot or burn\ncontributes almost a fifth of man-made greenhouse gases, scientists say.\n\n''There's a lot of scope for land-use change to play a very important role in\noverall targets,'' said Peter Iversen, a member of the Danish delegation at\nthe Bonn talks.\n\nProposals by some countries on ''land-use, land-use change and forests,''\nknown as LULUCF, risk putting more CO2 into the atmosphere that adds to global\nwarming. Australia wants to get credit for their forests and soils absorbing\nthe gases but not when they release it, such as in brush fires, an\nincreasingly frequent occurrence in one of the world's driest regions.\n\nFires in 2003 in Australia released some 200 megatons of CO2, about four times\nthe annual absorption rate, Greenpeace's Winn said yesterday. Earlier this\nyear, fires ravaged southeastern parts of the country after temperatures\nsoared above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nIf proposed rules on land-use are adopted at the climate talks, almost half of\nAustralia's planned emissions reductions of as much as 25 per cent by 2020\nfrom 2000 levels would be achieved ``on paper'' by its forests and crops, Winn\nsaid.\n\nThat credit would still be claimed even if fires destroy large stands of trees\nbecause Australia is demanding that CO2 emissions due to natural disasters not\nbe counted.\n\nNew Zealand's ''short-rotation'' forests of Douglas fir and pine will have a\nsignificant impact on how much carbon the Pacific nation emits, said Bryan\nSmith, a New Zealand delegate at the talks. That means developing a system\nthat takes those fluctuations into account and not penalize the country, he\nsaid.\n\nShort-rotation forests are trees grown and cut down or harvested in a few\nyears, common in warmer climates.\n\nPeatlands globally release 1 gigaton of carbon, or 8 per cent of global\nemissions, as they drain, said Hans Joosten, a researcher at the University of\nGreifswald. In the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, drying peatland\naccounts for almost a third of the region's emissions.\n\nToday is the final day of the talks in Bonn, part of a UN-sponsored effort to\nslow global warming by limiting the amount of greenhouse gases spewed into the\nair, mainly by wealthy countries. The talks, which continue in the former\nGerman capital in August, will culminate in Copenhagen in December when more\nthan 170 countries will attempt to set reduction targets for the coming\ndecades.\n\nIt will be ''physically impossible'' to have a detailed treaty reached in time\nfor the Copenhagen summit so more negotiations will be required to settle\nremaining areas of disagreement, the UN's chief negotiator Yvo de Boer has\nsaid.\n\nGlobal emissions must be cut at least in half by 2050 to avoid an average\ntemperature gain of more than 2 degrees Celsius that would lead to higher sea\nlevels, worse droughts and more intense storms, according to the UN's climate\npanel, or IPCC.\n\n", "url": "/business/australia-demands-bushfire-exemption-in-carbon-treaty-20090613-c6h4.html", "last_update": "2009-06-13T00:41:29.717Z", "source": "SMH"},

The guest of honour is a racist, a Holocaust-denier\nwho makes no secret of his intention of wiping Israel off the face of the\nearth.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon decried the Western boycotts as the list of\nabsentees lengthened and other European nations threatened to walk out.\n\n\"Some nations, who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better\nfuture, are not here,\" Mr Ban said as he opened the meeting in Geneva.\n\nCOMMENT & DEBATE\n\nOpportunity wasted **PAGE 13**\n\n", "url": "/world/outraged-israel-recalls-envoy-in-racism-furore-20090420-acob.html", "last_update": "2009-04-20T14:00:01Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "No more excuses, the minister must go", "article": "COMMUNITY Services Minister Lisa Neville sets up yet another inquiry into a\ndisturbing case that she knew nothing about ( _The Age_ , 18/9). The\nOmbudsman's report confirms her department failed to do police checks to keep\na vulnerable child out of the clutches of a convicted sex offender, despite\nthe child disclosing previous abuse by this person.\n\nTen years of Brumby and two years of Neville result in 2000 at-risk and abused\nchildren without case managers. We have also seen deaths of children where the\ndepartment failed to investigate and intervene. We are short hundreds of\nworkers in this chronically mismanaged area. All we get from the minister is\ntalk, reviews and no outcomes other than continued systemic abuse of the most\nvulnerable.\n\nIt is not good enough, Mr Brumby. If you will not save our at-risk children,\nat least take some responsibility and sack this minister.\n\n **Ken A. Smith, Richmond**\n\n### Reform the system\n\nINQUIRIES into child deaths have repeatedly shown that the key problems in\nchild protection are the difficulties of engaging with families in extreme\nemotional states, keeping a level of suspicion while trying to form a\nconstructive working relationship, and making risk assessments and decisions\nwith limited evidence.\n\nAll those working with vulnerable children must ask the right questions and\nmake the right call. They need skill, experience and courage to challenge\nparents effectively. They need enough time to spend with families and proper\nsupport to do this.\n\nDedicated professionals protect thousands of children every year. However,\nthey are overwhelmed by the scale of child abuse and lack of resources. The\nGovernment must reform the system to help make our child protection services\nfit for the children they were built to protect.\n\n **Noel Macnamara, Macleod**\n\n### PM's hidden agenda\n\nI CANNOT help feeling a little cynical regarding the appointments of Kim\nBeazley as ambassador to Washington and Brendan Nelson as ambassador to the\nEuropean Union and NATO ( _The Age_ , 18/9). While both are highly qualified\nand will do a wonderful job representing Australia, I do not believe they were\nchosen on their merits. Instead, Mr Beazley was chosen as payback for having\nbeen stabbed in the back by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gilllard, and Dr Nelson was\nchosen simply to have us believe Mr Rudd is acting in a bipartisan manner.\n\n **Tom Griffin, Pambula, NSW**\n\n### Forgotten people\n\nDEAR Kev, good onya for fixing up Bomber and Brendo with nice little numbers.\nAny chance of a job or two down Geelong way for a few, old, unemployed\nconstruction workers? All the best, mate.\n\n(Seeing as they don't need their pensions any more, we can divvy them up down\nhere.)\n\n **Bob Mancor, North Geelong**\n\n### More pain for poor\n\nI WORK in an industry that has a close relationship with Centrelink. Out of a\ncaseload of fewer than 200 people, one to three of my clients have their\nbenefits cut each week through clerical errors.\n\nThe Rudd Government's decision to double the reporting requirements for\npensioners undertaking part-time work from 12 to 26 times a year ( _The Age_ ,\n18/9) will lead to a significant increase in hardship caused by this\ndysfunctional organisation.\n\n **Hans Paas, Castlemaine**\n\n### A call for courtesy\n\nAS AN employee of a large TAFE, I believe there is a correlation between\nissues raised by Dimity Reed - ''Rudeness will be the death of society''\n(Insight, 8/8)) - and Farrah Tomazin's article on the rise of violence in\nprimary schools ( _The Age_ , 15/9).\n\nStudents from primary to secondary schools, and beyond, seem to be unaware of\nhow to behave in a respectful way. The F-word is so common that no one blinks\nan eye. I have led a far from sheltered life (including working as a welfare\nofficer at Pentridge Prison) but am appalled by the foul language and lack of\ncourtesy that surrounds me at work, on public transport and in the street.\n\nHow about educators get their act together and start banning rude, crude and\nrevolting behaviour in schools? Violence should not be tolerated. Suspending\nstudents is a temporary measure. Surely it would be better to allocate funding\nfor more special classes to assist troubled students deal with their\naggression and learn to behave in ways beneficial to society.\n\n **Lynne Lumsden, Blackburn South**\n\n### Our precious artists\n\n''MELBOURNE theatres set for big year'' ( _The Age_ , 18/9) is great news for\nmusic-theatre lovers and practitioners. Sadly, Sharman Pretty, the new dean of\nthe Victorian College of the Arts, does not seem to appreciate our pre-eminent\nposition in this artform. She has ''suspended'' next year's intake to the\nfledgling VCA music theatre course just when the industry is crying out for\nmore.\n\nIt is not too late to reverse this decision and develop our talented young\nsingers and dancers in Melbourne rather than seeing them head interstate for\nintensive training in music theatre.\n\n **Louise Connor, East St Kilda**\n\n### Crown says jump\u2026\n\nHOW high will the State Government jump to secure gaming revenue and appease\nCrown Casino? Redefining the definition of ''table games'' ( _The Age_ , 17/9)\nand excluding the principal body on responsible gaming from consultation\nrepresents a gross failure in the Government's duty of care to Victorians.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how much of the $132 million raised will be\noffset by funding additional anti-gambling initiatives.\n\n **Kate Gascoigne, Prahran**\n\n### Deep-seated racism\n\nLESLIE Cannold (Comment & Debate, 18/9) is wrong to argue racism is not a\nfactor in the right-wing criticism of Barack Obama. As a theological student\nin the late 1970s, I spent two years in Mississippi. Along with meeting many\nfine white, black and Latino people, I discovered that beyond the veneer of\nSouthern white hospitality was a deep distrust of anything deemed as\n''different''. Some church-going people - if pressed - evidenced a disdain for\nblack people and even argued that slavery was a good institution.\n\nSuch views are still found across the South, including South Carolina, the\nbase of outspoken Obama critic Senator Joe Wilson. I have not the slightest\ndoubt that many white people do not accept the legitimacy of a black\npresident, but suspect it is masked under calls for resistance to\n''socialism'' and a defence of ''liberty, democracy and the American way''. As\nfar as I could see from the television footage of the demonstrations against\nObama last week, there was not a black/Latino or Asian face to be seen.\n\n **Robert Humphreys, Coburg**\n\n### New pension rules\n\nTHE story \"New pay rules for pensioners\" ( _The Age_ , 18/9) about the\nAustralian Government's Work Bonus, which comes into effect on September 20\nand allows people on the age pension to keep more of the money they earn\nthrough work, needs to be clarified.\n\nPensioners have always had to tell Centrelink about their employment income to\nensure they are paid the correct amount of pension. Under the Work Bonus, only\nthose pensioners whose employment income varies from fortnight to fortnight\nwill be required to report more often.\n\nWhile people's circumstances differ, modelling undertaken by my department\nshows that a single pensioner who works for six weeks each year and earns\n$9000 and has no other income would, in fact, be $414 a year better off under\nthe new rules. When the value of the pension increase is taken into account,\nthe annual benefit is $1948.\n\n **Jenny Macklin, MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and\nIndigenous Affairs**\n\n### But it's so simple\n\nVICTORIAN taxpayers will spend almost $5 million hiring ''myki mates'' ( _The\nAge_ , 18/9) customer service staff who will rove the public transport network\nto help confused travellers understand the new smartcard system.\n\nI do not know how many people in Hong Kong use their equivalent of myki (the\nOctopus Card) daily, but I would say that it is far more than the population\nof Melbourne and perhaps Victoria. They are no more or less intelligent than\nthe average Melburnian, yet do not have to be babied over on a long-overdue\ntransport reform.\n\n **Denis Cartledge, Clarkson, WA**\n\n### Dangerous blows\n\nTHERE have been a number of cases in the news recently where victims\ntragically died or were severely injured following a single blow to the head,\nor even a push. We urgently need a public education campaign encouraging\npeople to understand that what might appear a trivial or commonplace response\nto conflict - fuelled by innumerable images seen at the movies and on\ntelevision - is actually a highly dangerous and stupid act that can ruin many\nlives.\n\n **Stephen Yolland, Templestowe**\n\n### It's footy, mate\n\nTHE sign in the front-page photo says ''Go Dog's!'' ( _The Age_ , 18/9) which\nimmediately raises the question: a dog's what? The obvious answer is not\nsuitable for a family newspaper. The alternative explanation is that late\nSeptember is not the time to expect respect for apostrophes.\n\n **Jim Hart, Fitzroy**\n\n## The real danger: bad drivers\n\nCYCLISTS not allowed to ride through city parks ( _The Age_ , 17/9) because\nthey pose a danger to pedestrians? Surely the same logic dictates that drivers\nare removed from the road as they pose a far greater risk to all who share\ntheir space than cyclists.\n\nRude, inconsiderate or dangerous cyclists are a tiny minority of park users. I\nhave safely and happily shared parks with bicycles as a pedestrian hundreds of\ntimes. I sympathise with those few who have had a different experience but it\ndoes not warrant fining people who are using paths in a safe and considerate\nmanner.\n\n **Becky Chanock, Brunswick**\n\n###  **Another near miss**\n\nMY ELDEST son used to go to the local primary school and we walked through the\nCarlton Gardens to get there. Every morning I took a deep breath and wondered\nhow many times I would need to yell ''slow down'' to cyclists, and how many my\nthree-year-old would have to dodge. Usually, when I yelled, I got a vacant\nstare; some cyclists actually went faster. My son now goes to a different\nschool and we drive there. I cannot believe I feel safer in a car than on the\npaths of Carlton Gardens.\n\n **Amanda McArthur, Melbourne**\n\n###  **Ridiculous fines**\n\nCYCLISTS watch out for pedestrians stepping out from between cars, drivers\nopening their car doors into their path, slippery tram tracks, cars cutting\nthem off, and walkers and their dogs in other parks on a regular basis. Why\nwould we suddenly be unable to take care of walkers in a public garden? The\nfines are ludicrous and serve as a disincentive to ride.\n\n **Anna Crowley, Hawthorn**\n\n###  **Try the road**\n\nMANY cyclists are on road bikes and travel at high speeds that are at a great\nnuisance, if not a danger, to people who simply want to enjoy the beauty of\nthese precious havens. Such restrictions are clearly stated at the park's\nentranceways. After being fined, Alistair Wenn says the alternative is to ride\non the footpath. Well, I ride on the road and it is not that difficult.\n\n **Victor Radywonik, Ascot Vale**\n\n###  **Selfish cyclists**\n\nAS SOMEONE who has walked my dog in Carlton Gardens for many years, I can\nassure you cycling in our gardens is not safe. On several occasions, cyclists\nsped between my dog and myself, hitting the leash. The result: one terrified\nand half-strangled dog, one very frightened pedestrian and one cyclist with\nminor injuries and a damaged bike. Cyclists who ride in our gardens and on\nfootpaths justify it by saying ''it's safer for me''. Many disregard cycle\nlanes, ride the wrong way in one-way streets and pay no heed to the road\nrules. Of course, they always blame everyone else.\n\n **Ronald Butters, Melbourne**\n\n###  **Keep them separate**\n\nEVERY day, thousands of commuter cyclists pour out of bike-friendly Canning\nand Napier streets. Blocked from entering Carlton Gardens, they are funnelled\ninto the bike-unfriendly shared path along the west side of Nicholson Street\nwhere they must cope with pedestrians drifting unpredictably across the path.\nLet's learn from the Dutch experience. There, cyclists and pedestrians are\nseparated by paths for each. In larger gardens, there is parallel - and\nseparate - provision for both. Along Nicholson Street, the footpath on the\neast side should be reserved for pedestrians while the current shared path\nalong the west side becomes a bicycle path.\n\n **Katrine Pilcher, Fairfield**\n\n", "url": "/politics/federal/no-more-excuses-the-minister-must-go-20090918-fvak.html", "last_update": "2009-09-18T14:00:01Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Billie Eilish becomes youngest person to record James Bond theme song", "article": "Billie Eilish has achieved yet another musical milestone. The 18-year-old pop\nwonder is recording the theme song for the upcoming, 25th James Bond film _No\nTime to Die_ , becoming the youngest artist to do so.\n\nEilish, who co-wrote the song with her brother Finneas O'Connell, will follow\nin the footsteps of such artists as Paul McCartney, Gladys Knight, Tom Jones,\nDuran Duran and Adele.\n\n\"It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the\ntheme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge\nhonour,\" the singer, who will also work with composer Hans Zimmer, said in a\nstatement tweeted by the franchise's official account. \"James Bond is the\ncoolest film franchise ever to exist. I'm still in shock.\"\n\n\"Writing the theme song for a Bond film is something we've been dreaming about\ndoing our entire lives. There is no more iconic pairing of music and cinema in\nmy opinion. We feel so so lucky to play a small role in such a legendary\nfranchise,\" O'Connell added on Instagram.\n\nEilish - whose brooding electropop has captured the world's ears and earned\nher six Grammy nominations (including album of the year, record of the year,\nsong of the year and best new artist) for the upcoming awards ceremony - is a\nfitting pick for the franchise, which tends to favour music with a stately\nsoaring sombreness. (Think: Adele's _Skyfall_ , which finds the singer's smoky\nvoice rising from vaguely threatening to victorious and back throughout the\ntune.)\n\nThe theme song - and who will perform it - has become an integral part of each\nnew installment in the Bond franchise, and it often earns the chosen artist\naccolades if not awards. (Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, who sang _Goldfinger_ ,\n_Diamonds Are Forever_ , and _Moonraker_ is the only musician who has\nperformed more than one.)\n\nArguably the most enduring song of the bunch is McCartney's _Live and Let Die_\nfrom the 1973 film of the same name, which was the first to earn an Academy\nAward nomination (more than a decade after the film series debuted) and\nreached No. 2 on the Billboard charts. But Duran Duran and John Barry's\neponymous _A View to a Kill_ in 1985 reached a higher peak in its own time,\nand is the only Bond song to top the charts in the United States.\n\nCarly Simon and Bill Conti both received Oscar noms for their Bond tunes, but\nthe franchise didn't secure a victory until recently. Only Adele and Sam Smith\nhave won the golden statues for their efforts: her for _Skyfall_ in 2012 and\n_Writing's on the Wall_ for 2015's _Spectre_ , respectively.\n\nIn some cases, making a song that isn't used in the movie can prove to be\nhelpful in its own way. A number of artists recorded songs for the franchise\nthat were never used, which they later repurposed to suit their own needs.\nBrian Wilson, for example, recorded a song titled _Run James Run_ in hopes it\nwould become a Bond theme. After it was rejected, he transformed it into the\ninstrumental _Pet Sounds_ on the iconic Beach Boys album. He revived the title\nyears later and put out a song called _Run James Run_ on his 2017 compilation\nalbum, _Playback: The Brian Wilson Anthology_.\n\nJohnny Cash's _Thunderball_ , Alice Cooper's _The Man with the Golden Gun_ ,\nand Blondie's _For Your Eyes Only_ were all also originally intended as theme\nsongs - as their titles suggest.\n\n _No Time to Die_ stars Daniel Craig in his final outing as 007, alongside\nfranchise newcomers Lashana Lynch of _Captain Marvel_ fame, _Bohemian\nRhapsody_ star Rami Malek and _Knives Out_ breakout Ana de Armas. Cowritten by\n_Fleabag_ and _Killing Eve_ mastermind Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the highly\nanticipated sequel hits theatres in April.\n\n **Washington Post, with staff writers**\n\n", "url": "/culture/movies/billie-eilish-becomes-youngest-person-to-record-james-bond-theme-song-20200115-p53rku.html", "last_update": "2020-01-15T01:17:48Z", "source": "SMH"},

{"title": "A Bond theme suits Billie Eilish quite well", "article": "Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas O'Connell, famously recorded her\nmegaselling, multi-Grammy-winning debut album _When We All Fall Asleep, Where\nDo We Go?_ by themselves in Finneas's childhood bedroom. The songs they made\nthere conjure an even more tightly claustrophobic space: Eilish's music sounds\nlike it's taking place within the quivering confines of a single anxious mind.\n\nBut midway through her latest single, _No Time to Die_ , the swell of a full\norchestra and the smoke rings of a moody guitar riff open into something more\npanoramic \u2014 and familiar \u2014 than we've heard from her before. The orchestral\npart was composed by Hans Zimmer, and the riff is played by former Smiths\nguitarist Johnny Marr, who collaborated on the score for _No Time to Die_ ,\nthe forthcoming 25th James Bond movie.\n\nThe track makes the 18-year-old Eilish the youngest artist ever to record a\nBond theme, the latest in a string of achievements that has made the\nprecocious Gen-Z-er a regular fixture on the Guinness World Records blog. But\n_No Time to Die_ also comes during a monthlong stretch that has felt a bit\nlike a mainstream debutante ball for the young superstar, who until very\nrecently was better known by her fellow teens than their parents. The Grammys\nchanged that; Eilish's subsequent performance at the Oscars two weeks later\ncemented the feeling that she was suddenly everywhere. (She crooned a solemn,\ntasteful cover of the Beatles' _Yesterday_ during the ceremony's ultra-\ndecorous In Memoriam segment.) In between those two busy weekends, she was\nrevealed as the cover star of the latest issue of Vogue.\n\nUnlike her generational cohort of anarchic SoundCloud rappers and sartorially\nsex-positive pop stars, Eilish has the kind of talent that is easily\nunderstood and praised by the old guard: She writes her own songs, she\nredirects the gaze from the shape of her body with oversized silhouettes, she\nhas a voice that, while whispery and strange, is still classically lovely. The\n56-year-old Marr summed up this sentiment on the red carpet at the Brit Awards\non Tuesday. \"Billie's just the best new, I don't want to say pop act, but it's\ngreat when someone that cool is that popular, individual and a lot of people\ncan relate to her,\" he said. \"I know a great musician when I see one.\"\n\nAt the same time, the ever-expressive Eilish has a way of telegraphing a\ncertain reluctance at becoming the next-gen poster girl of pop culture's most\ntime-tested institutions. Just before clinching the Grammy for album of the\nyear \u2014 the win that completed her sweep of the big four categories, making her\nthe first woman and youngest person ever to do so \u2014 she could be seen on-\ncamera whispering, \"Please don't be me, please.\" (A tweet captured the moment:\n\"Billie Eilish being genuinely disgusted by her own success is one of the most\nhilarious things I've ever seen at a major awards show.\")\n\nAt the Oscars, she was even less comfortable in her sanctioned role of\nAmbassador to the Youth. In an interview with Zane Lowe the day after the\nshow, she told him that she'd been sick on Oscar night and felt that she had\n\"bombed\" her performance: \"That [expletive] was trash.\"\n\nShe added, \"It was also, like, the Oscars is not my people. I'm not used to\nthat.\" She said as much wordlessly when the camera cut to her during an\nabsurdist bit by comedians Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig. Eilish's reaction\nshot of cartoonish befuddlement instantly went viral. \"If OK Boomer were a\nface,\" wrote one Twitter user, \"Billie Eilish just nailed it.\"\n\nShe has also pushed back against those who commend her for covering up her\nbody. \"The positive comments about how I dress have this slut-shaming\nelement,\" she said in a V Magazine interview last summer. \"Like, 'I am so glad\nthat you're dressing like a boy, so other girls can dress like boys, so that\nthey aren't sluts.' That's basically what it sounds like to me. And I can't\noverstate how strongly I do not appreciate that, at all.\"\n\nEilish's Bond theme, though, might be the Boomer-approved role she's embraced\nwith the most straightforward enthusiasm. \"We've been wanting to make a Bond\nsong for years,\" she told the BBC this week.\n\nMacabre and elegant, _No Time to Die_ proves that \u2014 despite the fact that the\nfranchise has existed for 39 more years than Eilish has \u2014 there is quite a bit\nof overlap between the aesthetics of Billie and Bond. Her vocal has her\ncharacteristic focused intensity, but as the strings swell toward the\nclimactic ending, Eilish rises to belt a note that is showier than anything on\nher debut album. When she hit it during her transfixing performance alongside\nFinneas, Zimmer and Marr at the Brit Awards, the crowd went wild.\n\nAs more opportunities and accolades inevitably come her way, time will tell\nwhich pop-star traditions Eilish will wholeheartedly welcome, which she'll\nrework in her own style and which she'll reject with her signature side-eye.\nGiven that the past two Bond themes \u2014 by Adele and Sam Smith \u2014 have earned\ntheir artists Oscars, it's quite possible that Eilish will be invited back\namong the movie stars next year. Maybe we'll get another \"please don't be me\"\nmoment right before her name is called. Or maybe by then Eilish will have had\na chance to make more sense of the surreal dream that has suddenly become her\nlife.\n\n **New York Times**\n\n", "url": "/culture/music/a-bond-theme-suits-billie-eilish-quite-well-20200221-p5436v.html", "last_update": "2020-02-24T00:40:32Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Health cuts affect all", "article": "I am concerned that any more health cuts to hospitals, pathology and\nprescriptions will affect the Canberra community and those who depend on our\nhospitals from the surrounding district.\n\nThis is because:\n\n\u25a0Canberra has a fair proportion of senior and elderly citizens;\n\n\u25a0Canberra provides specialist hospital services for a wide area that includes\nthe south coast and Goulburn;\n\n\u25a0Removing bulk billing for pathology will hit low-income earners and\npensioners hard; and\n\n\u25a0An additional co-payment for prescriptions will lead to people being unable\nto afford what they need.\n\nThese short-sighted cuts will lead to more pressure on hospital emergency\ndepartments, greater need for ambulance services, and increased hospital\nadmissions.\n\nThis will be detrimental to the community as a whole because many of the\npatients' relatives will also be affected and stressed, personally and\nfinancially, as a result.\n\n **Lucia Mayo, Waramanga**\n\n## A half-baked waste\n\nThe ACT government's grudging decision to provide kerbside collections of\ngreen waste (\"Garden waste bins, at last\", May 28, p1) is as belated as it is\ncynical.\n\nCynical because the government has chosen to introduce the trial service in\nKambah and Weston Creek, where the government is even more on the nose than in\nother electorates.\n\nAlso cynical because, according to Municipal Services Minister Meegan\nFitzharris, Labor has changed its position on providing garden waste bins\nafter listening to the people.\n\nThe government has certainly not listened to the people, particularly those in\nsouth Canberra who do not want to pay for a costly and inefficient tram\nbetween Gungahlin and Civic.\n\nAnd cynical too because before the 2012 election, when it claimed the service\nwould be too expensive, the government rejected a commitment by Canberra\nLiberals to provide this service to all residents if elected.\n\nPrompted by the forthcoming election, the otherwise profligate government\nbegrudgingly offers a half-baked trial service with no commitment to expand to\nother suburbs.\n\nThe need for a trial is completely unnecessary as information is readily\navailable from numerous NSW councils that have provided this service for\nyears. In particular, all Queanbeyan residents have had the service for about\n20 years, paid for in their rates.\n\nMeanwhile, Canberra residents either drive their green waste to collection\npoints or pay commercial operators, the majority of whom include a tip charge,\neven though there is no tip charge for this material.\n\nAs with the introduction of wheelie garbage and recycling bins to Canberra,\nthis city is years behind most NSW regional councils with a green waste\nservice.\n\n **Graham Downie, O'Connor**\n\n## Post haste\n\nI have just bought via the internet a small object from a shop in Spain. It\ntravelled from the shop to Madrid and reached there last Friday (June 10). The\ndelivery van came to my house with the parcel about 11am on the 14th. I was\nout but was able to collect it that evening, still fewer than four days, which\nincluded our long weekend.\n\nOn the carrier's website the parcel's trip is documented in full to the second\n\u2013 no fewer than 21 stages. The shop provided excellent documentation, which no\ndoubt supported very rapid clearance through Spanish and Australian Customs.\nEven so, this may be a speed record.\n\nWould anyone expect Australia Post to be able to compete?\n\nPerhaps its chief executive, Ahmed Fahour, could be posted (sorry!) for work\nexperience to the carrier in my story. Naturally his salary would be withheld\npending improved performance.\n\n **Brian Stone, Weetangera**\n\n## Argument hits pothole\n\nN. Bailey (Letters, June 13) accuses Mike Kelly of cynical vote-buying for\npromising to provide funds to upgrade the Barton Highway, and not doing so\nwhile he was part of a Labor government from 2007-13.\n\nThe part that Bailey seems unaware of is that until July 2, 2016, the Barton\nHighway was in the federal electorate of Hume, which has been held by the LNP\nCoalition since 1974.\n\nPerhaps his accusations should focus on the LNP because they didn't do\nanything about the condition of the road because it was in a safe LNP seat and\nthey are only now offering something because from July 2, it will be in the\nmarginal seat of Eden-Monaro.\n\n **Roger Brown, Rivett**\n\n## On the wrong track\n\nWhy does Road Safety Minister Shane Rattenbury want to build new learn-to-ride\nfacilities (\"Learn-to-ride centres the way of the future\", June 14, p3) when\nit would be cheaper to reopen the Belconnen learn-to-ride centre, and more\neffective to support Bike Ed?\n\nThe Belconnen centre ceased operating in 2007 when a report prepared by ARRB\n(which provides research, consulting, products and information services to the\nroad and transport industry) concluded that ACT Bike Ed on-road practical\ntraining was more valuable than off-road learn-to-ride centres that \"have\nlittle to offer children in the development of bicycle and related road safety\nskills.\n\n\"Such centres may inadvertently encourage students to become overconfident\nabout their ability to cope safely in traffic.\"\n\n **Leon Arundell, Downer**\n\n## Maths off the rails\n\nThe public release of the redacted contract agreement with the Canberra Metro\nconsortium by Capital Metro Minister Simon Corbell (\"Light rail deal puts\nunions at the wheel\", June 10, p1) has at least clarified what underlies the\nsurprisingly low contract price of $939 million previously announced by the\nminister.\n\nInstead of discounting the future payments committed in the 23-year life of\ncontract using a discount consistent with the maximum inflation rate of 3 per\ncent that the Reserve Bank has maintained since the mid-1990s, the government\nhas used a discount rate of 7.5 per cent to compute a present value of the\ncontract.\n\nIf the Reserve Bank's inflation limit figure is applied, the net present value\nof the contracted payments is about $1.3 billion. Then, to get a realistic\nproject cost, the $100 million budgeted to Capital Metro since 2013 must be\nadded, as well as the $50 million expected to be spent directly on the project\nby Capital Metro until 2019.\n\nThus a realistic project cost for the Gungahlin-Civic light rail is about\n$1.45 billion in 2016 dollars, not $939 million.\n\n **A. Smith, Farrer**\n\n## Turnbull's trickle-down economic strategy rests on shaky ground\n\nJessica Irvine's article \"It's not the economy stupid\" (BusinessDay, June 13,\np9) points out that markets, not governments, run the economy.\n\nThe government's role is to provide the enabling environment that allows\nmarkets to function efficiently.\n\nIrvine cites several examples of such enabling action \u2013 floating the dollar,\nderegulating the financial sector, decentralising wage bargaining and slashing\ntariffs.\n\nAll Labor initiatives.\n\nHaving swept away its leadership and buried its debt and deficit emergency\nrhetoric due to an embarrassing lack of progress, the Prime Minister, Malcolm\nTurnbull, is now selling tax cuts to top income earners and companies as his\neconomicplan.\n\nMany economic commentators have pointed out its high cost and limited benefit\n\u2013 in short, trickle-down economics rests on shaky ground.\n\nFar from being better economic managers than Labor, the Liberals record is one\nof largely squandering the benefits of the cyclical resources boom through\nvote buying, structural tax cuts and failing to use an historic opportunity to\nestablish a sovereign wealth fund, which could drive infrastructure investment\nand the nation's productive capacity for generations to come. Jobs and growth\nindeed!\n\n **Bill Dejong, Merimbula, NSW**\n\n## Values, not growth\n\nMatt Wade's article \"Our billionaires in the fast lane\" (Times2, June 15,\np4)speaks volumes about the prevailing values of our society and\nitsgovernment.\n\nOur Beloved Leader's oft repeated mantra \"jobs and growth\" does not appear to\ninclude the unpaid work of women in childrearing, housekeeping, and care of\nthe aged, sick and dying, or the essential jobs of community volunteers,\nwithout whose help society could not function.\n\n\"Growth\" seems exclusively to mean growth in economic productivity, population\nand popularity, not in environmental protection, altruism, understanding,\nwellbeing, creativity and wisdom.\n\nOver two millennia ago, Aristotle in his Nichomachean Ethics described a\nhierarchy of values, giving a less myopic view of society than does the PM. At\nthe top of the scale are what Aristotle referred to as spiritual values, such\nas altruism, making a useful contribution to society, and development of the\narts. His lowest values included the accumulation of wealth and property,\nsimilar to their dismissal by St Francis of Assisi.\n\nBillionaires might gain mental profit from reading the scripture of Mr Wade's\nBiblical namesake (Matthew 16.26): \"What shall it profit a man if he shall\ngain the whole world and forfeit his own soul\".\n\n **Bryan Furnass, Hughes**\n\n## Gun safety myth\n\nWith all the debate lately about gun laws in the USA, and the constitutions\n\"right to bear arms\" it seems to me that Americans want the \"right\" but don't\nreally \"bear arms\" all too often.\n\nTake the recent shooting at the gay night club in Florida as an example. Of\nthe 50 people shot dead, and another 53 injured and who knows how many escaped\nwithout injury; it would seem no one had a gun with them to defend themselves\nwith. Otherwise, surely someone would have shot this killer before he caused\nas much carnage as he did.\n\n **Hans Zandbergen, Kingston**\n\nOne aspect of your editorial (\"Cool heads needed after Orlando\", Times2, June\n14, p2) was expected. A causative link between a tragedy that involves\nfirearms and gun laws is uttered every time by a predictable chorus,\nespecially when it's American.\n\nSo logically, you disarm law-abiding citizens, and magically, such crime will\ncease. How did that work out for Parisians who have very strict gun laws?\n\n **Gerry Murphy, Braddon**\n\n## Both sides failing\n\nThe media is full of the activities of the leaders of the major parties,\nreporting on their promises which are really no more permanent than water\npoured into a colander. I consider that the major parties have failed\nmiserably in carrying out their responsibilities to the people and the nation\nand that is praising them too highly. So I will be voting for the minor\nparties in desperation. However the latter seem to have little publicity so\ncould The Times please put together an article listing the minor candidates,\ntheir bios and what their parties hope to achieve.\n\nThat would be most helpful.\n\n **Roger Smith, Scullin**\n\n## Uncertainty shows\n\nIt is interesting listening to the rants of the two major parties about where\nthey will allocate their preferences for the Greens Party and the Nick\nXenophon Party.\n\nAll it's doing is showing their uncertainty on their ability to end up either\nfirst or second in the ballot count. The point is, during the count for the\nlower house, preferences are not allocated until a candidate's count is\nexhausted. The preferences for the two final candidates are never allocated.\n\nWhat will decide the race in divisions where the count is close is where\nvoters who votefor minor parties allocate their preferences.\n\n **Norm Johnston, Monash**\n\n## History in perspective\n\nGreg Ellis (Letters, June 14) accuses Gerry Murphy of rewriting history, which\nis ironic considering Ellis's whole letter is a pathetic attempt to rewrite\nIsrael's history to fit his narrative. The Palestinian mandate, which had been\nthe homeland of the Jews and had a substantial Jewish population for thousands\nof years, was divided in 1948 into Jewish and Arab areas, according to which\nhad the majority population in each area. No one was forced out until, unlike\nthe Jews, the Arabs declared war.\n\nMost Arabs who did leave did so at the urging of their leaders, or to escape\nthe war zone, rather than being forced out. Israel's attacks against what\nEllis calls high-rise apartments have only ever been to target rockets or\nother military infrastructure.\n\nIsrael has roughly 1.5 million Arab citizens while the Palestinian leadership\ninsists that any Palestinian state must be free of Jews, yet Ellis falsely\naccuses Israel of ethnic cleansing. Ellis also claims Israel has repeatedly\nrejected a two-state solution, when Israel has actually made three generous\noffers of a Palestinian state, and the Palestinian leadership has rejected\nthem all.\n\n **Bill Arnold, Chifley**\n\n## Fairness in gas billing just so much hot air\n\nI recently received an account for nearly $250 for my quarterly natural gas\nbill. As I had been overseas for all except one week of the quarterly period I\nwas surprised how large it was. My comparable accounts for the equivalent\nperiod in previous years (when I was here) were around $80 (including the very\nlarge administration fee). The account was sent by email and did not include\nany information on usage.\n\nWhen I queried the amount I was told it was an \"estimate\".\n\nI asked what the meter reading had been at the end of the billing period and\nwas informed that they do not have enough people to read meters. However their\ncharter says they have to send a bill.\n\nI read out the current \"reading\" and was told my figure bore no relation to\nthe one theyhad based the estimate onandthat a new bill would besent.\n\nFrankly, I think their action is totally dishonest and indefensible. For many\npeople the difference between the real figure and the estimate could be the\ndifference between keeping warm or eating.\n\n **Roger Allnutt, Deakin**\n\n## Immigration silence\n\nM. Aken (Letters, June 14) says Australia has the third highest population\ngrowth of 40 OECD countries, after only Israel and Luxembourg, and that net\nimmigration is contributing significantly to that growth. If so, this is\nridiculous and immigration should be drastically reduced. This proposal has\nnothing to do with xenophobia or racism \u2013 it is simply common sense as\nexercised by almost all other countries.\n\nThe major political parties are neck and neck in the election race, and both\nare keeping quiet about immigration because it is beneficial to big business,\nand therefore to big donations. However, big business is not voting in the\nelection. If one of the parties announced that it would immediately reduce net\nimmigration to less than 100,000 a year (still extremely high by global\nstandards), it would win the election.\n\n **Robert James, Melba**\n\n## TO THE POINT\n\n **HEALTH FREEZING UP**\n\nThe Coalition government is promising to extend the Medicare rebate freeze,\ncut pathology bulk-billing and increase co-payments on prescription medicines.\n\nI am worried that most of my fellowseniors, who are already feeling the pinch,\nwill be left much worseoff by these uncaring promises.\n\n **Ian Paterson, Kambah**\n\nCanberra Hospital has long struggled to service both the ACT and a significant\nsurrounding area of NSW. The Coalition's cuts to primary health care concern\nus all. Labor's commitment to uphold Medicare and restore hospital funding is\nto be applauded.\n\n **Lois Wishart, Hughes**\n\n **LATE OR EARLY**\n\nToday I saw a blowie. Last one of autumn or first one of spring?\n\n **S.W. Davey, Torrens**\n\n **MORE LIKE A GUSH**\n\nMax Foster (Letters, June 14) is absolutely right. Over many years I have\nobserved that the purported trickle-down effect is, in fact, a gush-upwards\neffect. The term trickle-down is best described, in Richard Denniss's word, as\neconobabble.\n\n **Warwick Budd, Nicholls**\n\n **DRAWING A BLANK**\n\nGerry Murphy fired a blank with his claim (Letters, June 15) that automatic\nweapons are illegal in the United States. In at least 37 states, the ownership\nof fully-automatic weapons including machine guns with a Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives permit is legal.\n\n **David J. Richards, Moruya NSW**\n\n **TAKE AWAY CYCLE PATHS**\n\nMartin Miller (Letters, June 15) says cyclists are at risk because there's \"no\nphysical separation from ... motor traffic\" on busy roads. The obvious\nsolution is to stop providing cycle paths on busy roads.\n\n **R.S. Gilbert, Braddon**\n\n **AMY NOT AT FAULT**\n\nAmy Gillett died when an oncoming motorist in Germany crossed to the wrong\nside of the road and lost control of the car.\n\nAmy Gillett's fellow athletes suffered grievous injuries.\n\nThe driver was tried and sanctioned in the German judicial system. The\nassertion by Robert James (Letters, June 15) that Amy Gillett's death was due\nto riding in a group is deeply erroneous.\n\n **Peter Chesworth, Red Hill**\n\n **WHERE'S MY CARD?**\n\nFurther to recent letters about Zed Seselja's birthday solicitations, the\nsenator obviously thinks I am a Labor supporter \u2013 I received no card for my\nbirthday this week.\n\n **John Turner, Kambah**\n\nEmail: .

{"title": "Deep trouble", "article": "I didn't realise until I was older that _Deep Throat_ was the reason we'd\nmoved from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale in the summer of 1977, when I was\nsix years old. By the time my stockbroker father, Anthony Battista, had been\nsentenced for distributing the 1972 porn film, he had acquired interests in\nthree adult film theatres in Florida, in addition to still running the Golden\n33 strip club in Philadelphia. While it was still flourishing, my parents'\nmarriage had suffered. My father was ready to leave it behind and make a bold\nmove for our family.\n\nA few weeks before the move, my mother, Frances, was reading through _The\nPhiladelphia Inquirer_. As she had every Sunday for the past few weeks, she\nsearched for an article by reporter Jack Smith, who'd interviewed my father\nmonths before. That day she came across the headline, \"Stockbroker to\nPornbroker\", and saw my father's name in the paragraphs below.\n\nMy parents took turns reading the article.\"Geez, Anthony. He makes you seem\nlike the porn king of Philadelphia,\" said my mother when they were finished.\n\n\"Interesting quote: 'The only difference between selling stock and smut is I\ndon't have to wear a tie.' \" My father looked at my mother and chuckled.\n\nAfter two days of driving, we finally arrived at our new ranch-style house in\nPlantation, Fort Lauderdale. \"I love it, Anthony!\" my mother said as she\nwalked over the shiny new linoleum floors in the kitchen.\n\n\"I think we'll be happy here,\" my father said. He sounded relieved and flashed\nher a grin.\n\nWe examined every room of the house, turned on every tap and opened every\ncloset door. My room had a bright-yellow carpet, which I loved. Later, we\ngathered on the patio to stare at the crystal-blue pool encased by a screen\ndome that had a view of the canal behind our house. I felt like we were rich.\n\n **That summer, my evenings were spent** playing tag, riding bikes or swimming\nuntil dark. Our next-door neighbours, Hans and Aggie Mueller, were an older\nGerman couple. They frequently offered my mother advice as we settled into our\nnew home.\n\n\"Hans and I noticed how nice it was that your friends pick up your garbage,\"\nAggie said one day on the phone with my mother.\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" my mother said, her voice puzzled.\n\n\"But don't buy the City of Plantation garbage bags if you've got someone else\npicking up your trash. That's a waste of money.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah ... that's a good point, Aggie. Thanks.\"\n\nFlustered, my mother called the wife of my father's business associate.\n\n\"You sure it wasn't the lawn service?\" Pat said. \"Gosh, Frannie. That sounds\nstrange.\"\n\n\"Really strange,\" my mother said, unable to keep the fear and confusion out of\nher voice.\n\n\"Don't panic,\" Pat said. \"I'll come over on the next garbage day and we'll\nwatch to see who picks it up.\"\n\nDays later, they hid behind the drapes of our living-room window and watched\nthe curb. In the early afternoon, just before the normal city pick-up time,\nthey watched a dark sedan pull up. A man in a black suit and sunglasses jumped\nout and quickly tossed our trash bags into the trunk of the car.\n\nMy mother gasped. The man glanced back at the house. Pat and my mother both\nhit the carpet.\n\n\"Oh ... my ... God,\" Pat said slowly. \"Frannie, maybe it's the FBI.\"\n\n\"But why? What do they want with my trash?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nLater that afternoon, my father arrived home from his trip to visit the\nPremier Theatre in Orlando. He listened attentively as Mom told him quickly\nabout the man in the dark suit who had stolen the garbage. When she was\nfinished, he looked her in the eyes and said calmly, \"Frannie, the FBI might\nbe watching us. Be careful what you say on the phone. And that trash can in my\noffice? Don't ever empty it.\"\n\nOur boxes were barely unpacked when on August 31, 1977, my father was indicted\nby a Fort Lauderdale grand jury by order of a special taskforce on obscenity.\nWorking with the FBI, it had linked my father to the local Spectrum Design\nCompany, where the films for the Florida theatres were stored and where 245\nporn films were seized. Evidence from our trash had connected my father to\nSpectrum, and police claimed Dad was setting up accounts to distribute the\nfilms in Philadelphia. A warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\n **My attendance at Dad's trial** came near the end. His lawyer reckoned the\njury's opinion might be softened if the \"smut dealer\" they were trying to\nconvict had a cute seven-year-old daughter. Dressed in a bright yellow sun-\ndress and cardigan sweater, I played the part of the innocent pornographer's\ndaughter. I did my best to behave, smile at the jurors and occupy myself with\na pile of books.\n\nBefore the day's proceedings, my father turned around and gave me a wink.\nAfter that, I had no idea what was going on for the rest of the day. To me,\nall the lawyers sounded very mad and my mother seemed tense as she simply\nstared straight ahead.\n\nUltimately, my presence didn't help; a few days after I attended the trial,\nthe jury found my father guilty.\n\n ** _Edited extract from_ The Pornographer's Daughter _, by Kristin Battista-\nFrazee, published by Nero on Monday._**\n\n", "url": "/lifestyle/deep-trouble-20140825-3e8yk.html", "last_update": "2014-08-29T17:00:01Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "'Stopping the boats' an overriding obsession", "article": "If there's justice in this world, at some time Sri Lanka's President Rajapaksa\nand General Fonseka, the former head of the armed forces, will be investigated\nfor the alleged atrocities that occurred at the end of the civil war. These\nare well documented by the UN. Human rights abuses of Tamils in Jaffna and\nelsewhere continue to this day, while press freedom is a myth, with\njournalists and publishers in constant fear of arrest.\n\nIn this context, Tony Abbott's praise of Sri Lanka's \"commitment to democratic\npluralism and the rule of law\", his understanding of the use of torture -\n\"sometimes in difficult circumstances difficult things happen\" - and his\ngifting of two of our naval vessels so the Sri Lankan navy can round up people\nwho may be genuine asylum seekers, are unforgivable. His conservative allies\ndid much better: Canada's PM boycotted CHOGM, while Britain's PM, David\nCameron, attended but visited Jaffna to \"shine a light\" on the problem.\nClearly moved, he delivered an ultimatum to the President to investigate the\nallegations of war crimes within four months or face international\nconsequences. Mr Abbott's appeasement of Sri Lanka is driven by his obsession\nwith \"stopping the boats\". Nothing else matters.\n\n **Roger Gamble, St Andrews**\n\n### Many thousands still live in fear\n\nIt sickens me that Mr Abbott is playing down human rights abuses. I lived and\nworked in Sri Lanka while the civil war was still raging. It was not uncommon\nfor colleagues to talk about \"white van\" disappearances, and if someone did go\nmissing, a common remark said in truth, not jest, was \"check the canal\". This\nreferred to a canal in a southern suburb of Colombo, Wellawatte, that was home\nto a large Tamil community. I am deeply distressed and disgusted that Mr\nAbbott is choosing to push his \"Stop the boats\" agenda at the expense of\njustice for the thousands of Sri Lankans who still live in fear or have lost\nfamily members in mysterious circumstances without answers and, by extension,\nclosure.\n\n **Sara McMillan-Bauer, Soldiers Hill**\n\n### What you see is what you get\n\nWhile Mr Cameron plays the hero by accusing the government of human rights\nabuses, Mr Abbott is cast as a villain.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Cameron refuses to publish the Chilcot Report on the nation's\nrole in the Iraq war. Successive Australian governments of all persuasions\nhave condoned human rights abuses perpetrated by the US and its allies\nthroughout the world. Mr Abbott is no less predictable and devoid of substance\nthan the rest of the world's politicians when it comes to tackling human\nrights abuses; but at least he doesn't pretend otherwise.\n\n **John Richardson, Wallagoot, NSW**\n\n### No one's hands are clean\n\nIt is hardly surprising that Mr Abbott remains silent on the human rights\nabuses in Sri Lanka. Any criticism by him could otherwise be construed to be\nthe \"pot calling the kettle black\" given Australia's inhumane treatment of\nasylum seekers.\n\n **Phillip Bell, Frankston Heights**\n\n### Excusing perpetrators\n\nTony Abbott's unacknowledged quote from Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural\nAddress - that after a civil war we must \"bind up the nation's wounds\" -\nsounds great. But that is Lincoln speaking, not Mr Abbott. He could have gone\non to finish the quote - \"to care for him who shall have borne the battle and\nfor his widow and his orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\nand lasting peace\".\n\nI suppose we should be grateful that Mr Abbott or his speech writers have been\nreading Lincoln but the war and its consequences in Sri Lanka have been\nexposed before now as being horrific. The brutal murders, the disappearances,\nthe removal of men and boys, the rapes and the seizure of land have all been\ndocumented for anyone who can turn on a TV to learn about.\n\nSri Lanka produces refugees because conditions for the vanquished are\nterrible. And now Mr Abbott is using Lincoln's words to excuse those who have\ncommitted these atrocities.\n\n **Ellen O'Gallagher, Castlemaine**\n\n### Inviting a catastrophe\n\nWhat is missing from Nicholas Reece's otherwise excellent article (Comment,\n18/11) is a sense of the imminence and scale of the catastrophe the Abbott\ngovernment's climate policy vandalism invites. UN bodies and health\nauthorities are being advised to prepare for a world temperature rise of 4\ndegrees because scientists no longer believe politicians are capable of\nholding the temperature rise below the internationally agreed limit of 2\ndegrees above pre-industrial levels.\n\nForget about the hugely increased destructive capacity of \"extreme weather\"\nunder this scenario. The temperature rise alone is predicted to render large\nswaths of Australia's tropical north (including Darwin) uninhabitable and will\ndestroy the region's agricultural usefulness.\n\nFor eastern Australia from north to south the agricultural capacity of\nanywhere inland from the Great Dividing Range will be degraded or destroyed.\nWe will cease to be one of the few countries with excess agricultural capacity\nand will join the others who must import food to survive. We are within a\ndecade of this becoming inevitable and within 40 years or so of it becoming\nfact.\n\n **Doug Evans, Clifton Hill**\n\n### This is class warfare\n\nThe neo-conservative forces in this country like to label any debate\nconcerning tax reform that would result in, for example, a super profits tax\nor the repeal of negative gearing as \"class warfare\". I would suggest the\ncurrent debate about the repeal of the carbon tax is one of the most\nastonishing pieces of class warfare in modern memory.\n\nWe have a government ignoring all rational evidence of the certainty of the\ncataclysmic effect of climate change, which the poorest and least powerful\nwill feel the most, to favour the short and medium-term interests of a tiny,\npowerful and enormously wealthy elite - think Gina Rinehart, Andrew Forrest,\nClive Palmer, Nathan Tinkler and board members of Rio Tinto, BHP, Xstrata and\nso on.\n\nWhen governments rule to benefit powerful elites and against the interest of\nthe majority of its citizens we have a crisis of democracy.\n\n **Craig Horne, Fitzroy North**\n\n### The people step up...\n\nOn Sunday our family went to the climate rally. We joined a crowd of 30,000\npeople dressed in bright colours listening to speakers calling for action.\nSurprisingly, this rally wasn't full of of radical students or long-haired\nhippies, but a cross-section of Melbourne - families and individuals from all\nwalks of life, racial backgrounds and ages.\n\nThe unifying aspect was concern for Australia's future and a desire to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The feeling was that the government's confused\napproach to climate action by, on one hand, playing down the risks while, on\nthe other, trying to make out it is serious about reducing emissions, was bad\nfor the economy and the environment and risked derailing the global effort to\ntackle the problem.\n\nThe most important message I took away was that in the absence of a commitment\nfrom corporate leaders or the government to tackle dangerous climate change,\nordinary families are prepared to take real action themselves.\n\n **Barrie May, Glen Waverley**\n\n### ... in political vacuum\n\nWill the crowds that filled Treasury Gardens on Sunday and attended more than\n100 similar national ones demonstrating outrage at the lack of political will\nto tackle climate change make any difference? There has even been a paucity of\nmedia coverage. Constituents are demonstrating the moral concerns for the\nplanet that politicians seem to lack. Even the Pope sees himself with a new\nrole as an \"environmental crusader\" (\"Pope knocks fracking\", 16/11). Instead\nof making a positive contribution to the climate change debate, Mr Abbott\nmakes a gift of two patrol boats to Sri Lanka to help \"stop the boats, saying\ncynically \"there are few more important humanitarian issues\". Not for Mr\nAbbott himself no doubt. Even a \"conscience vote\" on issues such as voluntary\neuthanasia in Tasmania's Parliament was decided on party political terms when\nthe Coalition voted in a block.\n\n **Beverley McIntyre, Camberwell**\n\n### Sovereignty at risk\n\nFurther to your excellent editorial (18/11) about the dangers of the Trans-\nPacific Partnership Agreement, its investor-state dispute settlement\nprovisions would abrogate Australia's sovereignty. Under these provisions, if\na multinational believes an Australian law endangers its \"expected future\nprofits\", it can challenge the government in a tribunal that has the power to\noverrule our laws and levy fines against the Australian state. Our tobacco\nplain-packaging laws, for example, would be at risk of being overruled.\n\n **Paul Hobson, Camberwell**\n\n### Disrespect for privacy\n\nThe Philippines' despair was aptly highlighted in the article \"Quiet despair\nfor injured survivor\" (15/11). Reporting the various elements of this\ndisaster, including the widespread damage, the probability of disease, and\naccess to food, water and medical supplies, is fundamental. However, AMA\nVictoria is disturbed at the article's blatant disrespect for patient privacy.\n\nWhat is the benefit of detailing a man's medical condition? Or of publicising\nthe comment from one doctor that \"he sounds like a lost cause\". This patient\nis entitled to privacy and dignity. Australians would be outraged if their\nmedical condition or prognosis was broadcast to the world.\n\nIn Australia, patient privacy is sacred and our media outlets should uphold\nthe same level of respect to all patients, irrespective of what country the\nhospital is in. A disaster does not eliminate a patient's right to privacy -\nespecially in international newspapers.\n\n **Dr Stephen Parnis, president, AMA Victoria**\n\n### Spiteful response\n\nThe Abbott government is promising another inquiry into the roof insulation\nscheme - the ninth. If only Labor had the spite and venom of the Coalition. In\n2007, then PM Kevin Rudd could have had an inquiry into numerous events - the\nchildren overboard affair and Peter Reith's involvement or John Howard and\nAustralia's participation in the Iraq war to name just two. But no, the Rudd\ngovernment was busy trying to govern for all.\n\n **Kevin O'Rourke, Goonellabah, NSW**\n\n### Clean up own backyard\n\nPaul Howes is everything that is wrong with Labor (\"Labor should not oppose\nsale of Medibank Private, says union chief\", 18/11). Union membership is less\nthan 20 per cent of the working population. Maybe instead of advocating the\nsale of Australian infrastructure and undermining Labor governments, Mr Howes\nshould tackle the catastrophic decline of union membership and work for the\nmembers who \"voted\" for him.\n\n **Hans Pieterse, Narre Warren North**\n\n### Policy beggars belief\n\nIt beggars belief that the NSW government is considering forcing pregnant\nwomen who are the victims of domestic violence to sign a contract ordering\nthem to leave their abusers or else surrender their own child. Where is the\ncontract for men to sign saying they will stop abusing women or else they will\nbe forcibly evicted from the home? Why does a pregnant woman somehow become\nresponsible for a man's violent criminal behaviour and have to bear the\nconsequences?\n\n **Pauline Hopkins, Beaconsfield**\n\n### The big picture\n\nThe reason I and many others have ongoing respect for Paul Keating, Michael\nGamble (Letters, 18/11) is that irrespective of his strengths and weaknesses,\nsomething common to all of us, he has the ability to see the big challenges\nfacing our country, and tries to find solutions and not become preoccupied\nwith the insignificant, short-term concerns that now seem to immobilise us in\na state of fear.\n\n **Barry Knights, Port Melbourne**\n\n### AND ANOTHER THING...\n\n### The nation\n\nWhat's with Tony Abbott's obsession with boats? We've had \"Stop the boats\",\n\"Buy back the boats\", and now we are giving them away.\n\n **Serena Guild, Cherrybrook, NSW**\n\nTurning back the boats; buying the boats; gifting the boats. Our PM must have\nsome pirate's DNA.\n\n **Gary Bryfman, Brighton**\n\nScott Morrison has out-Ruddocked Philip Ruddock. John Michaels, Malvern\nBritain's queen is our head of state so we might as well have their PM as\nwell. David Cameron seems to have the moral compass for the job.\n\n **Brian Sanaghan, West Preston**\n\nIf a party gets elected on a tissue of lies, does it really have a mandate?\nAlan Cotterell, Benalla It seems 97 per cent of big business moguls and\nconservative politicians believe nothing should be done about climate change.\n\n **Lawry Mahon, Port Fairy**\n\nPaul Howes should pull his head in regarding the sale of Medibank Private.\nAnother unhelpful contribution.\n\n **Peter McNamara, Canterbury**\n\n### The state\n\nSpeaker Ken Smith epitomises the sort of self-serving politician our state\ndoesn't need or want.\n\n **Scott Ramsay, Strathdale**\n\nDr Napthine could solve his problems by following the federal example and\ngetting Geoff Shaw elected as speaker.\n\n **Rob Davids, Mordialloc**\n\nThe public-private partnership model as applied to Bastion Point means public\nexpense for private profit.\n\n **Jonathan Smith, Metung**\n\n ** ****  \n**\n\n", "url": "/national/stopping-the-boats-an-overriding-obsession-20131118-2xrd3.html", "last_update": "2013-11-18T09:31:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "This one for the subjects", "article": "**First Ladies: Significant Australian Women 1913-2013**  \nNational Portrait Gallery. Closes June 16 **Reviewer:** Sasha Grishin\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery in its collections and exhibitions generally\nplaces the significance of the sitter ahead of the aesthetic value of the art\nobject.\n\n _First Ladies: Significant Australian Women 1913-2013_ is quite a small,\ncameo exhibition of images of about 25 Australian women whose achievements in\npolitics, sport, business, the arts, entertainment, medicine, aviation,\nscience and social activism have seen them elevated into this hall of fame.\n\nThe majority of the works on display are photographs, and, with the exception\nof those by Juno Gemes and Max Dupain, are of quite forgettable quality. Many\nof the other portraits are traditional and rather dull easel paintings, with a\nsingle brilliant highlight being the famous self-portrait by Nora Heysen and a\nreasonable portrait painted by Judy Cassab. Another aesthetic highlight of the\nshow is the lively pastel drawing by Napier Waller of the war nurse Margaret\nAnderson.\n\nSo who are these ''great women''? Despite the rich holdings of images of\nAustralian women artists at the National Portrait Gallery, artists are poorly\nrepresented in this exhibition. Nora Heysen's self-portrait at the age of 23,\nas far as I can see, is the solitary representative of a woman artist.\n\nIt is a beautifully introspective portrait of quite a troubled and insecure\nyoung woman who was then escaping from the clutches of her dominating father,\nthe painter Hans Heysen.\n\nShe recalled that in her early years at home her father would slip into her\nstudio and ''improve'' on her paintings while they were still wet on the\neasel.\n\nNora, a loyal and devoted daughter who would not allow me to say a word\nagainst her father even when she was in her 80s, left South Australia in early\nadolescence to study art in London.\n\nOn the way she became the first woman to be awarded the Archibald Prize and\nthe first to serve as an official Australian War artist. On returning to\nAustralia she settled permanently in Sydney, where she died in 2003.\n\nThe aesthetic calibre of the show would improve if other self-portraits in\nthis gallery's collection, including those by Stella Bowen, Grace Cossington\nSmith, Janet Dawson, Evelyn Chapman and Jean Appleton were included and\nallowed to shine. Even the large Jenny Sages portrait of Emily Kame Kngwarreye\nwould enhance the show and make the point that Indigenous Australian women\nmade and continue to make a major contribution to Australia in realms other\nthan sport and social activism.\n\nSomehow it is difficult to think of the great women of Australia over the past\ncentury and not to include the three \"great dames\", Nellie Melba (there is a\ngreat portrait of her in the collection by Hugh Ramsay), Mary Gilmore and\nElizabeth Murdoch.\n\nOf course, the tyranny of space available to the curator and the desire to mix\nup the iconic Nicole Kidmans and Cathy Freemans of this world with those high\nachievers whose images deserve wider recognition, for example the feminist\nactivists Jessie Street and Rose Scott, are all considerations which must have\ncontributed to the final cut.\n\nThe photograph in the show which will attract the greatest attention is that\nof the young Julia Gillard, taken some four years before she became our prime\nminister.\n\nIt was made by the well-known celebrity photographer Robin Sellick. Sellick in\nhis home town of Broken Hill was initially best known as a dog photographer\n(although he did take pictures of other pets) By the 1980s he had graduated to\nwedding photographs while working in Adelaide. By the 1990s he had gained\nprominence as a portrait photographer.\n\nWith darkroom manipulation he managed to create an intense colour saturation\nin his images.\n\nHis image of Julia Gillard has her staring directly into the camera, while\naround her head is a halo of purple, the traditional regal colour of supreme\npower.\n\nI cannot remember this National Gallery showing images of a serving prime\nminister before, but in an exhibition devoted to the first ladies of Australia\nto omit its first woman prime minister would have been somewhat silly.\n\nAs Canberra kicks off its centennial celebrations the National Gallery has its\nsuperb Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition which proclaims that 2013 is the ''year of\nthe redhead'', and now the National Portrait Gallery with its show of super\nwomen has the dazzling photograph of Julia Gillard as the porphyrogenitus (the\nroyal one). Are our national cultural institutions sending us a message from\nthe parliamentary triangle?\n\n", "url": "/entertainment/art-and-design/this-one-for-the-subjects-20130215-2eiv0.html", "last_update": "2013-02-15T16:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Death of a once great institution", "article": "The Victorian government has an irrational obsession to destroy the TAFE\nsystem. The savage financial cuts in 2012 and 2013 have proven detrimental,\nparticularly in further marginalising the vulnerable by restricting their\naccess to courses.\n\nNow the attack is on the governance of institutes (''TAFE chairmen axed amid\nclaims of state power grab'', _The Age_ , 29/3). TAFE boards are founded on\nthe superb contribution of members drawn from across the community. They have\nvast experience and expertise, and are committed to supporting education and\ntraining. Their sitting fee is a pittance.\n\nHigher Education and Skills Minister Peter Hall's decision has nothing to do\nwith efficiency and effectiveness. It seems he was offended by the independent\nadvice that several boards provided regarding the damage caused by the\nfinancial cuts. What purpose does sacking the chairmen serve and what is the\nbenefit to the public?\n\n **Ian Predl, Sorrento**\n\n### No happy ending\n\nNot satisfied with having gutted a tertiary sector which is unable to meet the\ntraining needs of local communities, the Victorian government is now\ndetermined to silence the critics from within.\n\nAs an employment adviser in the Bendigo region, I come face to face with the\ndamage that the commercialisation of the TAFE sector is doing to the labour\nmarket. Those who find themselves unemployed because of the tenuous nature of\nmanufacturing cannot access retraining because of the funding cuts. The\nunemployed are hitting a further barrier to finding work, all in the name of\nan ideologically driven commercial imperative and all dissent is to be\nsilenced.\n\n **Hans Paas, Castlemaine**\n\n### Seeking answers\n\nThe wall that collapsed in Carlton ( _The Age_ , 29/3) was made of machine-\nmade bricks, and not the old handmade or Hawthorn bricks. How did such a wall\nbecome classified as ''heritage''? Also, were the sections of wall(s) that\nstabilised this ''heritage'' wall at right angles removed during the\ndemolition? If they were, it might explain why the wall collapsed. I am\ngreatly saddened by the death of the victims.\n\n **Benny Botelho, Dockside**\n\n### Yet another tragedy\n\nThe tragic wall collapse should be a warning that all unsupported brick walls\nabove a couple of metres in height are very dangerous. In Mentone's shopping\ncentre on a stormy day in mid-2008, an apparently solid brick wall was blown\nover by a wind gust. Sadly, it killed a woman who was walking past.\n\n **Leo Gamble, Mentone**\n\n### Was wall secured?\n\nActing Inspector Ian Lindsay of Victoria Police says the victims of the wall\ncollapse in Carlton were ''pedestrians in the wrong place at the wrong time''\n( _The Age_ , 29/3). He is not correct. Pedestrians on footpaths should be\nsafe at all times. That wall should have been secured for winds of such non-\nextreme magnitude (100km/h).\n\n **Elek Pafka, Melbourne**\n\n### People, not statistics\n\nSometimes, small things reveal much. Consider the language of Home Affairs\nMinister Jason Clare when he read his statement about the fate of those on the\nrecent capsized asylum seeker boat. Two persons were ''deceased'', he said.\n(Is ''dead'' too confronting a word?) One was a ''male'', aged about four. A\nfour-year-old male is a small child. But I suspect ''child'' is too intimate a\nword for a government determined to limit human fellow feeling when it comes\nto the plight of asylum seekers. It is best to keep the language coldly\nofficial. Will we ever know that little boy's name?\n\n **June Factor, Ivanhoe**\n\n### Preventing suicide\n\n''Coroner to get detailed picture of suicide'' ( _The Age_ , 27/3) offers the\ngood news that beyondblue is to subsidise a two-year investigation into\nVictorian suicides, which will become ''the state's first suicide register''.\nThis is not so. The Mental Health System of Victoria registered 1837 people in\nits care who died by suicide from 1992 to 2002. The investigation established\nthe majority of suicides occurred within five weeks of discharge from hospital\nand most of those were within a shorter period. It was a clear signal for more\nbeds and longer hospital stays.\n\nThe research was not completed or published. It is impossible to find out why\nso many deaths, so much time and so much money were wasted. Had the 10-year\nresearch project been finished and published for peer review, many suicides\nafter 2002 could have been prevented. It is hoped that this new research by\nbeyondblue saves lives.\n\n **Caroline Storm, Clifton Hill**\n\n### Time of celebration\n\nYour editorial ( _The Age_ , 29/3) includes comments about the recent turmoil\nwith issues facing the Christian church, principally the Church of England and\nRoman Catholic denominations. Those who question the faith held by millions\nacross the world can easily point to these matters as a sign of an institution\nunder threat.\n\nYet, as the editorial observes, the story of the crucifixion and resurrection\nof Jesus survives after 2000 years. For those of us who believe, Easter is a\ntime of reflection and celebration, an opportunity for the message to be\nshared. A simple demonstration of this occurred in the early light of\nyesterday when a stranger passed us on our walk with a greeting: ''Happy\nEaster.''\n\n **Allan Gibson, Cherrybrook, NSW**\n\n### A game, not war\n\nPlease, no more front-page headings such as ''Two tribes go to war'' ( _The\nAge_ , 28/3) to describe a game of football. It is a family-friendly team\nsport full of athleticism and energy. War is a blight on humanity, full of\nsadness and death. Let us celebrate AFL football for what it is.\n\n **Colin Tuckerman, Gisborne**\n\n### Cruel and inhumane\n\nHow many birds will be shot and left to die cruel, inhumane deaths during this\nduck shooting season? We can only guess. We are not a ''hunter gatherer''\nsociety, nor should we aspire to be. As a civilised society, we aspire to\nhumane methods of raising and slaughtering meat, methods intended to prevent\nthe possibility of ''missing'' and causing horrendous suffering to a living\ncreature.\n\nDuck shooting is not such a method. I am among the majority of Victorians who\ndo not want to kill wildlife for fun. The Victorian government should at least\nhave a referendum on duck shooting and allow the voices of the silent majority\nto be heard.\n\n **Ed Lamb, Clunes**\n\n### Abbott must explain\n\nEvery day we are bombarded with Tony Abbott's 30-second grabs: a cleaner\nenvironment, stronger borders, modern infrastructure, lower taxes, higher\nwages, more jobs, better services, and vibrant small businesses. Yet he\nrefuses to front up to in-depth interviews on ABC radio or TV to discuss how\nhis government would implement his promises. For a man who has relentlessly\ncriticised the current government, confining himself to slogans is not good\nenough.\n\nIn spite of its minority status, the government has passed 450 pieces of\nworthwhile legislation.\n\n **Kon Kourteff, Stonyfell, SA**\n\n### Win at any price\n\nBill Kelty's vain hope that a new conversation can be created by Labor\n(Comment & Debate, 28/3) is laudable but laughable. Julia Gillard has shown\nwith her ''misogynist'' mantra that she is determined to divide in her efforts\nto conquer. She has been allowed to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war in\nher flailing and failing prime ministership.\n\nEnough is enough. Australia will move forward only when united.\n\n **Douglas Potter, Surrey Hills**\n\n### A call for unity\n\nJulia Gillard and her government are under attack from the opposition and most\nof the media, Bill Kelty. The first priority of Labor MPs should be to attack\nthe opposition, not their own party. They should not accept cabinet positions\nif they are not prepared to adopt the convention of cabinet solidarity. Take\nnote, Kevin Rudd, Martin Ferguson, Simon Crean, Joel Fitzgibbon and Kim Carr.\n\nFormer MPs such as Maxine McKew, Lindsay Tanner and Graham Richardson should\nalso recognise that attacking Labor is not helpful. We do not need power\ngames. Would these people really rather have an Abbott government?\n\n **Anne Hollingshead, Camberwell**\n\n### True selflessness\n\nRecently I visited the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It is an amazing\ndisplay of the loyalty, mateship and selfless sacrifice in the defence of our\ncountry made by our armed services over the past century.\n\nOn leaving the memorial, I saw Parliament House clearly in the distance. It\nmade me think about the stark difference of what is on display in the two\nbuildings. Perhaps it should be compulsory for all politicians to visit the\nmemorial on a regular basis to reflect on this.\n\n **Ken Finley, Mount Martha**\n\n### Dangerous trips\n\nHow many more sideswipes by trucks and cars will take place underneath the\ndark tunnel/bridge between Alexandra Avenue and City Road before the\nresponsible power company does something about it? Maybe it is awaiting a\nclass action before it will act.\n\n **Jean McLean, Camberwell**\n\n### A source of finance\n\nSuperannuation is one of the many means by which the well-off can legitimately\nreduce their tax burden. It is arguably the easiest of these many loopholes to\nclose ( _The Age_ , 29/3).\n\nBut the government ought not overlook a material benefit from encouraging\npeople to invest in superannuation. Most of the money is used by funds to\nsupport Australian industry and productivity growth: superannuation is an\nincreasingly important source of finance for corporate investment, national\ninfrastructure, and venture capital. That is more than can be said of\ninvestment in alternatives open to the well-off such as rental property and\nfamily trusts, racehorse breeding and the like, all of which will get a kick\nalong if the superannuation loopholes are closed.\n\n **Clive Edwards, Mount Crosby, Qld**\n\n### Oh, the poor dears\n\nLabor MP Joel Fitzgibbon said this week that some households earning $250,000\na year were struggling. Obviously that is wrong. If these people are\nstruggling, it is because they are living at a level above their income. The\nsimple solution: they should do without a lot of the luxuries that they\nbelieve are essential.\n\nThousands of Australians live on pensions. We do our best to manage our\nfinances. How insulting and ignorant of Mr Fitzgibbon. I think he needs a\nstrong dose of reality. I will happily teach him how we manage responsibly.\n\n **Elizabeth Gardiner, Braybrook**\n\n### Choosing to pay\n\nJohn Schaab (Letters, 28/3), you do not ''have'' to pay anyone to change your\noil, fit a power point or fix your plumbing. You can do this all yourself, if\nyou have the skills to do so. You may not have these skills, so you choose to\npay.\n\nIt is not unionism, communism or socialism, but more so capitalism.\n\n **Adam Dorkins, Clarinda**\n\n### Service, what service?\n\nWhy is it that United Energy's service faults telephone line is never answered\nand that when you check the company's website, it says nothing about power\noutages in your area? We lost power between 4pm and midnight on Thursday.\n\nWe tried every means of getting through to the service faults line for hours\nand hours, but no one from United Energy responded. It was non-existent\ncustomer service. I also thought that the new smart meters told the power\ncompany when you were using power and when there was none. How we yearn for\nthe return of the people's SECV.\n\n **Sotirios Katakouzinos, Main Ridge**\n\n### What day is it?\n\nI was amazed when I picked up my newspaper on Friday to find that Saturday's\n_Age_ was being sold. Given that you are able to see and report into the\nfuture, will you now also print the results of tomorrow's races in today's\npaper?\n\n **Malcolm Gray, Kilcunda**\n\n### It's Friday \u2026 I think\n\nThere I was, reasonably confident that it was Good Friday (and this was\nconfirmed by the radio telling me so) and ready to read _The Age_ editorial\nand letters to the editor, but then I was reduced to irritation.\n\nHow could my eagerly awaited _Age_ get the day wrong? It presented itself as\n_The Saturday Age_. Surely if management can manage the move to a compact\nsize, it can get the day right.\n\n **Hugh McCaig, Blackburn**\n\n### What's more...\n\nHow about journalists asking Tony Abbott why, when and how questions? If he\nwon't answer them, then let us readers know.\n\n **Michael Brinkman, Cowes**\n\n **Politics**\n\nI applaud Suzanne Savona's letter (28/3). Better the devil you know than the\none you don't know. Who knows what awaits us if the Coalition wins?\n\n **Roy Hunt, Lara**\n\nThank you for Gay Alcorn's article (29/3). Too often the media is agenda-\ndriven no less than politicians.\n\n **Craig Smith, Brunswick West**\n\n **Victoria**\n\nSome residents in fire-prone areas are experiencing disquiet in regard to the\nDepartment of Sparks and Embers.\n\n **Victoria Moore, Gerangamete**\n\nDenis Napthine, a vet, has a strange attitude to duck hunting and jumps races.\nI thought he might have more compassion and ban both.\n\n **Lorraine Bates, Surrey Hills**\n\nCamel trains to Doncaster and the airport.\n\n **Merle Stewart, Blackburn**\n\nHow tragic for a wall to collapse and kill people. But how heartening to see\nthe speed at which young ones and others moved to help. Inspirational, to say\nthe least.\n\n **Ross Barker, Lakes Entrance**\n\n **Sport**\n\nWhat does a high-performance cricket manager do between 9am and 5pm?\n\n **Dick Stratford, Portarlington**\n\nThe AFL more popular than Jesus (29/3)?

{"title": "Faster, more frequent public transport", "article": "Denis Napthine describes the east-west link as ''game-changing''. In fact, it\nwill do nothing except deliver trucks to the eastern suburbs and result in the\ndestruction of parkland and heritage buildings.\n\nGame-changing would be developing public transport infrastructure to get\npeople off the roads, freeing them up for those who genuinely have to drive.\nGame-changing would involve: high-speed signalling to allow fast, frequent\npublic transport; buses every night of the week, just as in London, Amsterdam\nand Sydney; and extending rail, tram and buses across Melbourne so that no one\nlived more than a short walk from these services.\n\nThe east-west tunnel is a waste of money that will subject Melbourne to even\nmore congestion for decades.\n\n **Paul Dwerryhouse, Brunswick**\n\n **  \n**\n\n### More cars means more emissions\n\nClifton Hill Primary School fears it may have to move, or even close, during\nconstruction of the east-west link ( _The Age_ , 18/7). Linking Melbourne\nAuthority suggests that air quality in the area ''could'' improve due to\ntraffic being moved underground. This is false. The air quality will be worse\nbecause there will be more vehicles and therefore more emissions. Also, these\nemissions will not magically disappear just because the road will be\nunderground. The link is big, expensive and will make congestion worse.\n\n **Adam Hutterer, Northcote**\n\n###  **  \n**\n\n### Why a rail tunnel is the best option\n\nOn any reasonable comparison, a metro rail tunnel offers a superior outcome,\nboth transport-wise and value for money, than the east-west road tunnel.\n\nThe road link will have a peak-hour capacity of about 7500 persons per hour\neach way, whereas a metro rail tunnel would have a comparable hourly capacity\nof 35,000 passengers each way. In addition, a rail tunnel would free up track\nspace on the existing Caulfield and northern loops for many additional rail\nservices. There would also be extra capacity to allow for the construction of\na railway to Melbourne Airport and new lines to Doncaster and Rowville.\n\nThe state government's projections for the new road link assume a large\nproportion of drivers from the Eastern Freeway will be prepared to pay an as-\nyet-unknown toll. Past studies have indicated this may not be the case and\nthat a majority will continue to exit, and congest, Hoddle Street to avoid the\ntoll.\n\nBoth projects would cost much the same. The federal government is correct in\noffering $3 billion towards a metro rail tunnel ahead of the road tunnel. By\nopting for the latter option first, the Napthine government may well lose out\non any federal funding for either project.\n\n **David Hardy, Highton**\n\n### Lalor, used up again\n\nWhile I have no issue with Julia Gillard leaving her home in Altona and moving\nto Adelaide to be with loved ones ( _The Age_ , 18/7), I do have a problem\nwith the way my electorate of Lalor is used. It is an extremely safe Labor\nseat, and the party feels free to parachute in any favoured union member or\nparty apparatchik without due consideration of the people they are supposed to\nrepresent.\n\nThe voters of Lalor have a great opportunity to change their representation in\nCanberra by not voting for either major party. Send a message that we want\ntrue representation, not another outsider using the seat as a flag of\nconvenience to further their careers.\n\n **Geoff Maloney, Altona Meadows**\n\n### Joys of being an ex-PM\n\nThe sale price or rental value of Julia Gillard's home is none of our\nbusiness. Nor are the reasons she is moving to Adelaide. What should concern\nvoters is: do all politicians gain so much support - an office, a small staff\nand other benefits, including 40 free domestic flights per year (with spouse),\nfree home and mobile phones, and a private car - following retirement or is it\nrestricted only to former prime ministers?\n\n **Bruce Dudon, Woodend**\n\n **  \n**\n\n### Our right to speak out\n\nI am outraged that McDonald's Australia has slapped Supreme Court writs on\neight anti-development protesters at Tecoma ( _The Age_ , 18/7). They feel the\nproposed store is an inappropriate development.\n\nWhat is Australia coming to when mums and dads are denied the right to\nprotest? Does money and big business override our everyday rights?\n\nMcDonald's is trying to bully the Dandenong Ranges community into submission.\nEvery Australian should be appalled at its tactics. The company says it wants\nto work with, and in, the community but this is a funny way to show it. Stand\nstrong, the Tecoma 8.\n\n **Carl McMahon, Belgrave**\n\n### Unity, not division\n\nWhy don't the two highly competent central participants in the asylum-seeker\ndebate - Immigration Minister Tony Burke and shadow immigration minister Scott\nMorrison - share their knowledge and expertise?\n\nA strong bipartisan policy would be more likely to deter people smugglers. And\nimagine having a principled and workable policy that we could be proud of, as\nopposed to one whose central purpose seems to be to divide us in order to win\nvotes.\n\n **George Finlay, Balaclava**\n\n **  \n**\n\n### Fleeing to safety\n\nIndonesia is not the problem. People smugglers are not the problem. Syria,\nAfghanistan, Sri Lanka and Sudan etc are the problem. You cannot stop people\nfrom running away from danger; you have to try to remove the danger.\n\nWhere is the voice of the United Nations? Blaming people smugglers and\npretending that we can stop it by sending people back to face death is\ninhumane and misleading. Politicians need to stop pretending that what we do\nat this end of the crisis can succeed. Tell the truth.\n\n **Melanie Bennetts, Lower Templestowe**\n\n### The shrinking rebate\n\nRecently I heard a discussion on ABC radio about the growing gap between\ndoctors' charges and Medicare rebates. The commentator recalled the early days\nof the scheme when the gap was very small (about 10 per cent, he claimed) and\nlamented the current state of affairs when it is often around 50 per cent.\n\nIf only it were. I have just received a rebate of $36.55 for a specialist's\nfee of $210. How have we (through our governments) allowed this to happen?\n\n **Gabrielle Baldwin, South Melbourne**\n\n### Sorry, but never again\n\nThe ''horror'' that has turned me off attending the Afghan exhibition at the\nMelbourne Museum ( _The Age_ , 18/7) is memories of my last experience as\nTutankhamun visitor 785,263.\n\nLike cattle, we were packed in hot and tight under the lens of the souvenir\nphoto camera, then released down a ramp into pit-like rooms where all that\ncould be seen were glimpses of exhibits between heads and bodies. Still\nsmarting from the high admission prices, we had to endure the gift shop maze\nbefore finally reaching fresh air.\n\n **Heather Smith, Heidelberg**\n\n### My rating? Diddley squat\n\nCould we please have our quick crossword back. The current version has moved\nout of the category of general knowledge into the category of ridiculous. Some\nexamples of the clues and answers from Monday's crossword: Santa's hood -\nLapland; zilch - diddley squat; agreed mate - I'm with you; precursors to hump\ndays - Tuesdays.\n\n **Faye Bleeker, Springvale South**\n\n###\n\n### The wealth gap widens\n\nNicolle Flint (Comment, 18/7) is a cheerleader for big business and banking.\nThe well-worn argument that decreasing taxation and regulation on the\ncorporate sector results in greater productivity, and therefore greater wealth\nfor all, is still very much up for debate.\n\nDuring the prosperous four decades or so following World War II, Australia\n(and the Western world) was far more egalitarian. Social democracy protected\nthe poorer parts of society and regulated the wealthy. Now we have two major\nparties that, by their policies, continually widen the gap between those in\npoverty and the super-wealthy. The latter have a disproportionate degree of\npower and influence. The Liberal and Labor parties are beholden to these\ninterests. I am thankful that the Greens seek to serve the majority.\n\n **Dylan Linde, Torquay**\n\n###\n\n### Taking responsibility\n\nSteve Biddulph (Comment, 17/7) explores influences on young boys' sexual\nmaturation but does not mention teaching them about their fertility. Boys who\ndo not take responsibility for the procreative aspect of their relations with\ngirls are encouraged to think lust leads to sex and that is all there is to\nthe encounter. Recognising the possibly of getting a girl pregnant is surely a\nprofound responsibility for every boy who wants to do more than ''talk'' with\ngirls. And if he doesn't want to, then financially supporting the unplanned\nbaby is his next responsibility on the road to manhood.\n\n **Jan Richardson, Eltham**\n\n### Put the animals first\n\nI cancelled my Friends of the Zoo subscription (Focus, 17/7) - and stopped\nvisiting when I asked a member of staff why the larger animals such as\nelephants, giraffes, orang-utans etc were still impounded in enclosures too\nsmall for anything like a natural environment.\n\nI was told it was because tourists in particular wanted to see them and\nWerribee Open Range Zoo was too far away. I asked them to think about special\nbuses to Werribee.\n\nAs international zoo consultant and former Werribee director David Hancocks\nsaid, they are putting commercialism first, not the welfare of the animals.\n\n **Cecily Falkingham, Donvale**\n\n### Hit hard by FBT change\n\nPeter Allen (Letters, 18/7) believes the government has reached the right\nbalance in balancing the financial impact of scrapping the carbon tax. It has\nintroduced a range of measures, including scrapping the fringe benefits tax\nand salary packaging arrangements that many thousands of Australians access.\n\nIt is a common misconception that salary packaging is a big company rort.\nHowever, many moderate-income earners like myself use it to ensure they can\nafford a reliable, modest car for work and private use. The latter has been\nthe smallest usage. If I fail to do my designated mileage, I pay tax at the\nconclusion of the FBT year.\n\nThe flow-on effect (from the change) for the Australian car industry and the\ncompanies who handle our salary packaging will be significant.\n\n **Glenda Fisher, Woodend**\n\n###  **And another thing**\n\n### Sport\n\nWhen will Caroline Wilson's attacks against James Hird end? When his head is\non a plate?\n\n **Elizabeth Kent, Ballarat Central**\n\nWe suggest the _Age_ and Caroline Wilson recognise people are considered\ninnocent until proven guilty.\n\n **Gwen and Bob Barham, Brighton**\n\nWas it racially motivated when Australian cricket coaches were passed over for\nyou, Mickey Arthur?\n\n **Doug Perry, Mount Martha**\n\n### Politics\n\nWill ''Kevin adores Kevin'' be permitted on Melbourne's ''lovelocks''?\n\n **Carl Keeney, Sunshine North**\n\nNicolle Flint, there may be problems with the Greens' policies, but at least\nthey care about the underdogs.\n\n **Geoff McNamara, Newry**\n\nIf lack of policies is an invisible substance, then Abbott is best qualified\nto talk about them.\n\n **Gary Greenway, Northcote**\n\nIs it now all about stopping asylum seekers, not the boats?\n\n **Hans Paas, Castlemaine**\n\n### Carbon dioxide\n\nTo demonstrate the presence of carbon dioxide, you just need to use infrared\nrather than visible radiation.\n\n **Tony Michell, Mount Waverley**\n\nDuncan Paterson (18/7), carbon dioxide is available in supermarkets - soda-\nstream canisters and soda-bulbs are full of it.\n\n **Dan Barr, Warrnambool**\n\nCarbon dioxide is available in bike shops in cartridges used for pumping up\ntyres.\n\n **Paul Worden, Portland**\n\n ****\n\n", "url": "/national/faster-more-frequent-public-transport-20130718-2q74x.html", "last_update": "2013-07-18T17:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Australians 'lack understanding' of China: O'Farrell", "article": "The NSW Premier, Barry O'Farrell, says a \"lack of understanding\" of state-\nowned enterprises has shaped Australia's attitude towards Chinese foreign\ninvestment in the country.\n\nThe true nature of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was \"poorly\nunderstood\", which created \"unwarranted anxieties\" towards Chinese investment\nin Australia, Mr O'Farrell said, citing a report prepared jointly by KPMG and\nthe University of Sydney.\n\nMr O'Farrell is leading a trade and investment delegation to China this week,\nand made the comments during a visit to the southwestern Chinese city of\nChengdu.\n\nDoug Ferguson, the head of KPMG Australia's China Practice, told _BusinessDay_\nthat Chinese SOEs are driven more by the desire for profit margins than by\npolitical considerations, and that there needed to be a \"fundamental shift\" in\nhow they are perceived by Australia.\n\n\u201cA more sophisticated understanding of Chinese SOE ownership would be helpful\nfor foreign investment review considerations and government policies,\u201d Mr\nFerguson said. \u201cThe reality is that Chinese SOEs abroad act in many ways like\nother international corporations.\u201d\n\nFederal Opposition leader Tony Abbott told an audience of Chinese and\nAustralian business leaders in Beijing last week that \"it would rarely be in\nAustralia's interests to allow a foreign government or its agencies to control\nan Australian business\", comments that drew a largely negative reaction from\nthe Australian business community.\n\nNow back in Australia, Mr Abbott has been defending his remarks, telling ABC\nRadio this morning that he welcomed foreign investment and that it was not\ncontroversial to scrutinise foreign investment from state-owned entities.\n\n **Investment worries**\n\nMr Abbott's view had some support within the Coalition.\n\nAddressing a grains industry conference in Melbourne this morning, the leader\nof the National Party in the Senate, Barnaby Joyce, said he welcomed foreign\ninvestment but that he is concerned with SOEs and regarded them as \"arms of\nthe government\".\n\nHe said foreign investment rules in Australia were not as tough as many other\nforeign countries, pointing out that some states in the US do not permit\nforeign investment in agricultural land.\n\nPhilippa Purser, the Australian managing director of US commodities trading\ngiant Cargill, said while fear-mongering was unhelpful, state-owned\nenterprises of any origin would naturally attract greater scrutiny from\nregulators in any jurisdiction.\n\n\"It's reasonable to ask a few more questions if it's a state-owned\nenterprise,\" Ms Purser said.\n\nThe visits of Mr Abbott and Mr O'Farrell to China coincide with a flurry of\nhigh-profile delegations seeking closer ties and investment dollars.\n\n **Flurry of visits**\n\nA business delegation consisting of Fortescue Metals boss Andrew Forrest, ANZ\nchief executive Mike Smith, NAB chairman Michael Chaney and Business Council\nof Australia heads Tony Shepherd and Graham Bradley met vice-premier Wang\nQishan in Beijing this week.\n\nVictorian Premier Ted Baillieu is also understood to be making a trip to China\nnext week.\n\n\u201cChinese economic growth is creating exceptional opportunities for greater\nengagement between Australia and China in many areas - business, trade,\ntourism, education and research,\" Mr O'Farrell said.\n\n\u201cMy message during my trade and investment mission to China is that we want to\nengage with our Chinese counterparts to identify these opportunities and build\nstrategic partnerships that will be mutually beneficial.\n\nThe KPMG-USyd report showed a total of $US45 billion was invested by Chinese\nenterprises in Australian businesses. Almost 80 per cent of this tally was\ndirected into mining industries and a further 12 per cent into the oil and gas\nsector.\n\nThe report found that of the 116 deals completed in the past six years, 92\nwere made from SOEs, worth 95 per cent of the total investment from China.\nThis ratio is notably higher than the 70 per cent global average.\n\n\u201cGiven the focus on mining and energy and the resultant size of transactions\nin these sectors, it\n\nmakes sense that SOEs would currently dominate investment in Australia, as\nthey have easier access\n\nto finance and established networks accumulated through years of minerals\ntrading with Australian\n\nbusinesses.\u201d said Hans Hendrischke, a professor at the University of Sydney's\nChina Studies Centre.\n\n _with **Peter Cai**_\n\n", "url": "/business/australians-lack-understanding-of-china-ofarrell-20120801-23exc.html", "last_update": "2012-08-01T05:45:10Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Trampling over scientific method", "article": "CRAZY things are happening in our Alpine National Park. The Department of\nSustainability and Environment, on its website, suggests it is necessary to\ncommence a study, for maybe six years, to see if ''grazing prevents blazing''.\nHowever the CSIRO website states that ''the available bio-physical evidence,\nbased on long-term ecological research and the behaviour and impacts of the\nwidespread 2003 fires, suggests it does not''.\n\nApparently the government requires more proof. The DSE website states that\nmore work is needed on the ''effects of grazing on fuel load and structure in\nall alpine and subalpine ecosystems''. Reading on, it appears to say that they\nneed to spend the first year of the study ''completing analyses of the\nscientific literature'' as well as working out what they will actually be\nstudying and how they are going to do it. But with indecent haste, they have\nalready let the cattle back in.\n\nThis breathtaking disregard for the usual scientific method cannot be\nexplained rationally. At best it is an overreach by an L-plate government: at\nworst it is an example of how powerful lobby groups have taken over the\ndemocratic process.\n\nMuch has been written about the well-funded white-anting of science when it\nshows that we must change our habits, particularly as regards smoking and\nclimate change. Sadly, it looks as if the Baillieu government intends to do\naway with inconvenient science on new fronts, wherever it encounters a dummy-\nspit by one of its mates.\n\n **Jo McCubbin, Sale**\n\n### Contradictory information\n\nKEY information provided by the Minister for Environment and his department\nabout the project is contradictory. The minister says grazing will continue\nuntil April 30, while his department tells us it will end on June 30. The\nminister says grazing is allowed on six sites totaling 25,600 hectares, the\ndepartment says it is 26,200 hectares. The minister says up to 400 cattle can\ngraze the nominated areas while the department says the figure is 400 ''adult\nequivalent cattle'', meaning that 800 young cattle could actually be grazing\nin the park.\n\nA major part of the project is another review of the scientific literature by\nProfessor Mark Adams. But Professor Adams has already reviewed this\nliterature, when he was head of a similar project at the Bushfire Cooperative\nResearch Centre.\n\nAnother part to be done in the first year is to work out techniques to track\ncattle and how to measure the effect of grazing on fuel loads - all things\nthat have been done many times before and which could all be done outside the\nnational park. This project is starting to look more like a political payment\nto the rednecks in the National Party than an attempt at serious science.\n\n **Dean Wotherspoon, Northcote**\n\n### Promise of transparency\n\nI HOPE the government's original press release of its alpine grazing program\ngives comfort to Bronwen Murdoch (, 20/1). Reported in _The Age_ (10/1), it\npromised the winners of high-country grazing licences would be decided by\npublic tender, making the whole process open, transparent and on the public\nrecord, just as we would expect of the new Premier.\n\n **Rex Niven, Eltham**\n\n### Cull the feral animals\n\nNO DOUBT Philip Maguire is delighted at the prospect of receiving a taxpayer\nsubsidy for grazing his cattle in the Alpine National Park (, 19/1). However\nfor the alpine environment, the economy of adjacent towns that rely on\ntourism, and the remainder of the population who prefer their alpine\nrecreation in an environment unpolluted by cow manure, the decision to\nreintroduce cattle is a disaster.\n\nMr Maguire correctly points out that feral animals are a major problem in the\narea, but then supports the reintroduction of another animal that has caused\nso much damage in the past. Perhaps a solution to this management problem\ncould be to employ mountain cattlemen, with their undoubted knowledge of the\narea, to cull the feral animals, rather than once again damage this fragile\nand superb alpine area with their cattle.\n\n **Russell Patterson, Croydon**\n\n###\n\n### High Court decision blight on reputation\n\nTHE High Court's decision (, 20/1) to refuse an injunction to release four\nAfghani children from detention is likely to seriously damage Australia's\ninternational reputation.\n\nA central concern has been Australia's treatment of children in our\nimmigration system. While you do not need to be an expert to appreciate that\nkeeping already traumatised children in detention is deeply inhumane, there is\nnow plenty of credible research to testify to the danger of such action.\n\nAustralian governments in different jurisdictions have also repeatedly failed\nto protect vulnerable children in state care and for whom it is acting in loco\nparentis. For many children, removal from their home actually places them at\ngreater risk. As ombudsmen's and other reports attest, we have a very poor\nrecord in carrying out one of our most basic responsibilities: our duty of\ncare towards the most vulnerable.\n\nThe recent High Court decision is also at odds with action by the Attorney-\nGeneral's Department to showcase our humanitarianism, and specifically our\ncommitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This entails\nensuring a child's right to adequate facilities and services, and to good\nhealth and rehabilitation, as well as an obligation for us to protect and care\nfor vulnerable children.\n\nThe High Court's action regrettably does little to secure our reputation as a\nplace where we take seriously our regard for the rule of law, which includes\nrelevant international laws.\n\n **Professor Judith Bessant, RMIT University**\n\n### Too soon to call\n\nYESTERDAY'S editorial stated that ''fortunately the critics have been proven\nwrong'' in relation to the Teach for Australia program (\"\", _The Age_ , 20/1).\nThe editorial refers to the fact that of the initial intake of 45 people, most\nhave decided to not drop out after their first year. Considering they need to\ncomplete two years to get their teaching qualification it is hardly surprising\nmost have decided to stick it out. However, does this make the program a\nsuccess?\n\nFirst, there has been no quantitative evidence to suggest there has been any\nimprovement to student performance as a result of Teach for Australia.\n\nSecond, it remains doubtful that the people involved in the program will make\na long-term contribution to education. Experience from similar programs in the\nUS and UK tell us to expect most of the ''associates'' to have moved on to\nother careers within five years. It seems premature to be declaring Teach for\nAustralia a success.\n\n **Michael Minas, Williamstown**\n\n### Effort all for nought\n\nYOUR  makes disturbing reading for registered teachers. Years of action to\nraise teacher training to professional standards have come to nothing.\n\nWhile Finland, with one the best schooling systems in the world according to\ncomparative tests, requires teachers to have master's degree status in\nteaching practice, we follow a broken system in the US and a flawed one in\nBritain.\n\nThe invalid assumption at the centre of the Teach for Australia scheme is that\nhigh-flying recruits will be better able to handle tough classes. They will\nnot. A case could be made to show that they are less likely to relate to slow\nlearners' struggle because their own was a passage of success.\n\nWe need highly qualified teachers equipped with professional techniques that\nhelp school-refusers relate to a relevant curriculum. Only the best is good\nenough for our kids, not a stand-in scheme that further buries us at the\nbottom of the OECD scale of education funding.\n\n **Graeme Lee, Fitzroy**\n\n### On the bandwagon\n\nHOW quick big business is to push for government spending when it is in line\nto benefit. If the fat cats are so concerned about the flood recovery, perhaps\nthey should pass the hat around and let Julia Gillard have her surplus. Then\nthey can get back to wining and dining our democratically elected\nrepresentatives while calling for cuts to health, education and social\nservices.\n\n **Matthew Engert, Preston**\n\n### Picking up pieces\n\nIT WAS with initial pleasure but then sadness that I read about the George\ncinema in St Kilda reopening shortly ( _The Age_ , 20/1).\n\nRalph Taranto's comments that programming will be pitched at the under-30s\nmeans that yet again many local residents are ignored in favour of those who\ntreat our suburb as their personal ''party land'' - flooding in on nights,\nweekends and any time the temperature tops 20, or bunking down in backpacker\naccommodation.\n\nIt seems St Kilda's older residents must seek their entertainment further\nafield, as more and more shops, clubs and restaurants cater almost exclusively\nto the young. These same outlets wonder why their business diminishes so much\nthrough the winter months and plead for locals to support them.\n\nWe just get to put up with the noise, traffic, graffiti, anti-social behaviour\nand pick up their rubbish from our gardens.\n\n **Kathryn Richards, St Kilda**\n\n### Rewriting history\n\nIT SEEMS a bit unfair to taint George VI with anti-Semitism in 1939 using\nfacts not verified until years later ('''', _The Age_ , 20/1).\n\nThere was a large and bloody revolt by Palestinian Arabs from 1936 to 1939. A\nmajor trigger was illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. There was no\nobvious reason to support this immigration at the time - and there were plenty\nof reasons to be against it in terms of imperial policy, which would no doubt\nhave been George's primary concern. Britain had previously promised Palestine\nto both the Arabs and the Jews, and the conflict this caused had started. More\nimmigration would have been more fuel on the fire.\n\n **Charles Meo, Northcote**\n\n### West treated badly\n\nALTONA commuters will not be surprised by  to a train every 22 minutes. The\nservice on this line has been woeful for years and continues to deteriorate.\nWe can only look on with envy when we read that there will be a train on the\nSandringham line every eight minutes. This mess must be fixed.\n\n **Jennifer Williams, Altona**\n\n### Tread cautiously\n\nCAROL Ride's reference to more than 95 per cent of climate scientists backing\nthe human-induced climate change theory requires clarification (, 20/1). The\nfigure, initially 97 per cent of active climatologists, arises from a study by\nresearchers at the University of Illinois.\n\nIt refers to the belief of 75 of 77 mostly US climatologists that human\nactivity is contributing to global warming. Less frequently reported is that\n47 per cent of the geologists and 64 per cent of the meteorologists who\nresponded to the two-question survey held the same belief.\n\nThe opinion of 75 climatologists is hardly representative of world scientific\nopinion. As more senior scientists express their doubts about the global\nwarming theory it is probably wise of the Premier to adopt a cautious\napproach.\n\n **Bill Griffiths, St Kilda West**\n\n### Revolving doors\n\nFROM one who has recently worked in a homelessness agency, I applaud Tony\nKeenan's comments (, 19/1). Despite all the promises around rooming house\nreforms little has changed at the coalface. For-profit rooming houses remain\ngrossly overpriced, with most unfit for habitation. Government-funded\nhomelessness agencies that assist with emergency accommodation rely on a\nshort-list of rooming houses, many of which are not checked for health and\nsafety, but without which there would be nowhere to house people.\n\nThe homelessness housing service is effectively a revolving door for those\ndesperate enough to hope for a rare rooming house vacancy and those exiting a\nrooming house due to bullying, abuse, bed bug sores, drug use on the premises,\nor inappropriate behaviour associated with mental ill health.\n\nSinking into the homelessness sub-culture greatly increases the risks of harm.\nThis needs to be shouted out, loud and often. Current short-term crisis\noptions are not working. Doing our best with what we've got is the best way to\ncontribute to recurring homelessness.\n\n **Gillian Eckersley, Williamstown**\n\n### Selectors drop ball\n\nBRAD Hodge will go down as one of the unluckiest cricketers. He has been one\nof the most prolific scorers in Australia's domestic game for a long time, but\nhas never been given much opportunity at the top level. In five tests, he has\nnever let us down, averaging 58.42. So why does he get dropped? In one-day\ninternationals this season, he is the top scorer with an average of 82.33. He\nwas selected in the squad of 30 for the World Cup but was not picked in the\nsquad of 15.\n\nThe question will always be asked, why did the selectors never give Hodge the\nchances he deserved?\n\n **Sebastian Miletic, Mount Macedon**\n\n###\n\n### And another thing...\n\nMY FINGER is sore from muting Jim between every point. Surely there is someone\nelse.\n\n **Sam Evans, Hawthorn**\n\n ****\n\n### The state\n\nDRINK-drivers allowed back on the road due to a technicality. How many will be\ngrateful for a second chance, and how many will give the police a two-fingered\nsalute and go blithely on with their drink-driving?\n\n **Marie Nash, Doncaster**\n\nIT COMES as no surprise that Ted Baillieu is a climate change denier, Melanie\nLazarow (, 20/1). I mean, if he wasn't he wouldn't be a Liberal leader: just\nask Malcolm Turnbull.\n\n **Henry Herzog, St Kilda East**\n\nI SUPPOSE the crash into the ''stationery'' freight train led to a lot of\npaperwork.\n\n **Chris Curtis, Hurstbridge**\n\n###  **Federal politics**\n\nTHE school I work at, and many others in the community, are pleased with their\nnew buildings. Ours came in under budget and on time, an experience repeated\naround the country. I am sick of conservatives using the Queensland floods to\ntry to make political points.\n\n **Michael Jongen, Westgarth**\n\nMAYBE Julia Gillard will now begin to understand the difficulties Australians\ncontinually experience when unexpected costs are introduced into their already\ntight budgets.\n\n **Nola Martin, Preston**\n\nWITH the number of committees set up by Julia Gillard - from climate change to\nthe mining super tax to Queensland's rebuilding - how long will it be before\nwe run out of people to choose from?

{"title": "Army tender ambushed", "article": "THE Gillard government has been accused of interfering in a Defence tender\nprocess to buy the next generation of army trucks, pushing a generous portion\nof the multibillion-dollar contract to the Victorian-built Bushmaster.\n\nDefence and industry insiders have told _The Saturday Age_ the government has\ntried to circumvent recommendations from the Defence Materiel Organisation,\nwhich favoured a cheaper armoured truck made by German company Rheinmetall\nMAN. It beat both Mercedes-Benz and the modified Bushmaster Ute, which is made\nin Bendigo by French company Thales, in the Defence tender.\n\nThe Bushmaster Ute not only came last in trials, but costs up to three times\nas much as its rivals. It is more expensive to service and rolled twice in\ninitial testing due to a high centre of gravity.\n\nDespite this, a source in the DMO told _The Saturday Age_ a message came back\nfrom the government after the German company topped the tender process: ''Any\noption that doesn't include Thales is no option.''\n\nAnother insider said: ''The government wanted to keep Bendigo open and it\nwould close if we didn't give them some work.'' They said the government was\ntrying to influence the final departmental decision, worth as much as $1.7\nbillion.\n\nWhile the DMO recommended Rheinmetall MAN, the government has yet to make a\ndecision on the tender. The department denied being asked to include Thales as\na successful tenderer. It said the final decision would rest on ''the needs of\nour soldiers and best value for money''.\n\nThe delayed project for 2700 medium and heavyweight trucks, some of which\ncould be used in Afghanistan, includes 1500 vehicles with substantial armoured\nprotection.\n\nThales has bid to supply 900 of its new Bushmaster Utes - worth more than $500\nmillion - to replace the army's ageing fleet of Unimog trucks.\n\nPrivately, a number of parties have raised concerns about political\ninterference in the tender.\n\nIn March, Mercedes-Benz Australian president Hans Tempel wrote to Defence\nMinister Stephen Smith to express concerns about ''the overall process of\nselecting a final tenderer \u2026 and whether undisclosed factors will play a\nrole''.\n\nThe letter, which has been obtained by _The Saturday Age_ , was written after\nLabor's Bendigo MP Steve Gibbons stated publicly that the government could\nreverse the DMO's final decision. The MP told the ABC that while the DMO might\n''overlook Bushmaster, we may be able to overturn that \u2026 because ultimately it\nwill be a government decision''.\n\nMr Gibbons has been a vocalcampaigner for Bushmaster, which has cut 100 jobs\nin his constituency in the past year. In his reply to Mr Tempel, Mr Smith\nwarned Mercedes-Benz ''a letter has recently been sent to all tenderers \u2026\nreminding them of their obligations regarding public announcements and\ncommunications''.\n\nThe department has reminded all three tenderers of their obligation not to\nspeak to journalists.\n\n _The Saturday Age_ believes there are further concerns the government\nintervened in a separate contract awarded to Thales in May, when 101\nBushmaster troop carriers were purchased for $130 million, despite the army\nneeding less than half as many to replace damaged vehicles. That contract will\nkeep the Bendigo production line open for at least another year.\n\nSources say the army originally requested 31 vehicles, but Defence increased\nits request to 61. The final purchase of 101 vehicles is seen by insiders as\nexcessive, and they claim there are dozens of Bushmasters sitting unused in\nstorage.\n\nThe department says ''there are no unused [deployable] Bushmasters in\nstorage''.\n\nHowever, aerial pictures taken last month show 89 Bushmasters sitting on\nDefence land in Brisbane (and there were 61 pictured there last year).\n\nA DMO source said: ''This is protectionism. We are trading off the safety of\nsoldiers and we are trading off capability for an Australian-made option.''\n\nThis week, Mr Smith said he would make no decision on the contract until after\nhe received a recommendation from the department. Speaking at Thales's Bendigo\nplant he said: ''We will await Defence advice and then we'll make a\njudgment.''\n\nThe department makes a recommendation based on the technical merits of each\nmanufacturer, but before a formal submission is made it must consider what is\nknown as ''Whole of Commonwealth requirements'' for army vehicles.\n\nDefence and contractor sources say this is ''industry policy being run out of\nDefence''.\n\n''What annoys me is the man on the ground will miss out [because] the\ngovernment is directly intervening,'' said a source involved with testing the\ntrucks.\n\nA test driver said: ''My vested interest is as a soldier on the ground who, in\nthe end, will have to use the vehicle.''\n\n''That vehicle [Bushmaster Ute] doesn't meet the tender specifications. You\ncan't load it above the cab height \u2026 and there are the centre of gravity\nissues. Really, it's not a vehicle we can use, and the army doesn't want it.''\n\nThe new Bushmaster utility had initial testing problems, suffering from\npotentially fatal rollovers and unacceptable vibration in the driver's cabin.\nSome sources say these issues are still outstanding, while others insist they\nwere fixed.\n\nOne source said that while all three vehicles had minor weaknesses, they met\nthe contract requirements and all were better than the current fleet in\nAfghanistan.\n\n", "url": "/national/army-tender-ambushed-20110722-1ht4z.html", "last_update": "2011-07-22T14:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Nobel Peace Prize guessing game begins", "article": "Al Gore is a front-runner for the Nobel Peace Prize if you believe some\nexperts.\n\nProblem is, they're only guessing.\n\nThe coveted Nobel awards to be announced next week cover the range of human\nendeavour, from peacemaking to scientific discovery, yet share a tradition of\nmystery, deep secrecy and wild speculation about who might win.\n\n\"I've been surprised almost every time,\" key Nobel watcher Stein Toennesson,\ndirector of the International Peace Research Institute said.\n\nToennesson's picks strongly influence media coverage and odds set by\nbookmakers, even though he has no inside information.\n\nEach year he bravely publishes a widely cited, well-reasoned, well-founded and\n- he admits - usually wrong set of surmises.\n\nThis year, with world attention fixed on global warming, Toennesson said\ngiving a joint prize to former US Vice President Gore and Canadian Inuit\nenvironmental activist Sheila Watt-Cloutier could be an appealing choice for\nthe prize committee.\n\n\"It would have to do with climate change and it would be a prize that included\nboth a man and a woman,\" he said.\n\nAnother possibility would be to give the prize to the UN's Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change, he said.\n\nOthers mentioned include Finnish peace mediator Martti Ahtisaari or activists\nlike Lida Yusupova from Russia, Rebiya Kadeer from China or Vietnamese monk\nThich Quang Do.\n\nThe peace award is announced in Oslo, while the other prizes - medicine,\nphysics, chemistry, literature and economics - are announced in Stockholm. The\nprizes, established in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, were\nfirst handed out in 1901.\n\nEach award carries a 10 million Swedish kronor ($A1.74 million) cash prize.\n\nThe Swedish and Norwegian committees separately deciding the awards work in\ndeep secret, refusing to even say who is nominated until the announcements,\nwhich begin on Monday with the medicine prize in Stockholm.\n\n\"It's always fun if it comes as a surprise,\" said Hans Jornvall, secretary of\nthe medicine prize committee.\n\nThe final decision will be taken Monday just before the announcement, he said.\n\nFor the literature award, British bookmaker Ladbrokes gave Italian writer\nClaudio Magris Magris the lowest odds, ahead of Australian poet Les Murray.\nAmerican novelist Philip Roth - whose name appears in Nobel speculation every\nyear was third.\n\n\"I would like to see the prize go to an American this year. There are at least\ntwo who really deserve it: Cormac McCarthy, who got the Pulitzer prize for his\nlatest novel 'The Road,' and Philip Roth,\" said Jonas Axelsson, of the Bonnier\npublishing house in Stockholm.\n\nThe three women and two men on the peace prize committee sometimes pick a\ncomplete outsider like last year's winner, Bangladeshi economist Muhammad\nYunus and his Grameen Bank.\n\n\"Sometimes we honour a well-known person, sometime we use to it to lift\nsomeone into the spotlight,\" said Geir Lundestad, the peace committee's\nnonvoting secretary.\n\nLundestad also said the prize has increasingly been used to underscore that\nmany building blocks are needed to achieve peace, including protecting the\nenvironment, sharing resources, eliminating poverty, as well as reaching peace\nor disarmament accords.\n\nEvents riveting world attention just before the prize is announced - such as\nrecent pro-democracy protests in Myanmar - are rarely honoured, because the\ncommittee enforces a strict February 1 nomination deadline.\n\nIn Gore's case, his high profile could be the greatest obstacle to winning the\npeace award, because he already has the world's attention on climate change.\n\n\"I have a feeling that climate change is appropriate (for a prize). I also\nhave a feeling that it would not be Al Gore.\n\n\"He does not need it,\" Dan Smith, a former director of Oslo's peace research\ninstitute, said.\n\nSmith said he could imagine the committee in Europe's far north honouring\nsomeone like Canada's Watt-Cloutier, because of their own concerns of melting\nice and warmer winters.\n\n\"Of course, they often tend to buck the trends.\"\n\nSmith said he doubted that Ahtisaari, the former Finnish prime minister, would\nwin for his efforts in Aceh and Kosovo because \"they don't usually give it to\na mediator.\"\n\nThe Nobel prizes are always presented on the December 10 anniversary of the\ndeath of its creator, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.\n\n", "url": "/world/nobel-peace-prize-guessing-game-begins-20071006-12ud.html", "last_update": "2007-10-06T02:05:52Z", "source": "SMH"},

Headliner **360** has his\nown show mere weeks later (June 29, 8pm, Metro Theatre, , sold out).\n\nJune is a big month for Australian alternative rock, too, with three of our\nfastest-rising acts playing their biggest gigs yet: the ever-compelling **the\nJezabels** (June 9, 7pm, Hordern Pavilion, $50), the relentless **Matt Corby**\n(June 12-14, 8pm, Metro Theatre, sold out) and, though you might question her\npresence in such emphatically established company, **Lanie Lane** (June 2,\n8pm, Metro Theatre, $22) - but know that that's Lane's second Metro show, the\nfirst, the night before, having long since sold out.\n\nIf the Aussies are giving Gaga some fierce (but always friendly) competition\nas to who owns June, some of our friends across the ditch are staking a strong\nclaim to July. With Jemaine Clement featuring as the bad guy in _Men in Black\n3_ and Bret McKenzie brandishing an Oscar for one of his songs in _The\nMuppets,_ you can fairly call New Zealand's ingenious comedy-folk duo **Flight\nof the Conchords** ''all-conquering heroes'' (July 5 at Opera House, sold out;\nJuly 6, Sydney Entertainment Centre, Haymarket, , 1300 883 622, from $50).\n\nIt'll also be fun to see their fellow Kiwi Pip Brown play _Anxiety_ , the\nfollow-up to her ARIA Award-winning eponymous debut as **Ladyhawke** (July 18,\n8pm, Metro Theatre, from $43.90).\n\nFinally, just as any good playlist winds down after a big opening and a strong\nmiddle, August brings winter to an attractive close with a couple of fine\nsinger-songwriters. Brit success story **Ed Sheeran** (August 1, 8pm, Enmore\nTheatre, sold out) caps off a remarkable year or so playing to a full house\nbefore **Kate Miller-Heidke** (August 23, 8pm, Metro Theatre, $49.95) points\nus prettily towards the joys of spring. **  \nGeorge Palathingal**\n\n### Film\n\nPeople who think winter is a time to stay in and rug up in front of the TV are\nmisguided. It's summer for the world's largest moviegoing audience (the US),\nwhich means, in an age when the films that keep Hollywood going are released\nalmost simultaneously across the globe, your cinema will be overflowing with\nblockbustery goodness.\n\nYou can safely bet that if any flick is going to challenge _The Avengers_ for\nmost box-office records obliterated this year, it'll be **_The Dark Knight\nRises_** (July 19). The third in Christopher Nolan's flawless reinvention of\nthe Batman legend pits Christian Bale's Caped Crusader against his toughest\nadversary yet: the terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy), who broke Batman's back in the\n_Knightfall_ comic-book series.\n\nThe other unmissable superhero film of the season is **_The Amazing Spider-\nMan_** (July 4). It feels soon for a reboot of the franchise (even if Tobey\nMaguire's third and final outing in 2007 was terrible) but the trailers\nsuggest a wittier, thoroughly refreshed take on the web slinger - and that the\nfilm is going to make exceptional use of 3D technology.\n\nYou don't need a mask and a garish costume - or even characters from the\noriginal - to have a successful franchise, though, which is where **_The\nBourne Legacy_** (August 16) and **_Prometheus_** (June 7 - like _The Dark\nKnight Rises_ worth seeing on the Imax screen) - come in. The former has\nJeremy Renner as a kind of successor to Matt Damon's uber-spy Jason Bourne,\nwhile director genius Ridley Scott revisits the universe of his sci-fi classic\n_Alien_ for the latter (although he has denied that _Prometheus_ is a\nprequel).\n\nOver in the world of animation, the fourth instalment in the _Ice Age_ series,\n**_Ice Age: Continental Drift_** (June 28), cashes in on 21st-century cinema's\nobsession with pirates, when the prehistoric posse gets lost on the ocean.\nThose reliable folk at Pixar take a chance on an uncommon type of celluloid\nhero - a heroine - with some of Scotland's finest actors (Billy Connolly,\nRobbie Coltrane and Kelly Macdonald in the lead role of Princess Merida)\nlending their brogues to new-school fairytale **_Brave_** (June 21).\n\nFor something completely different - for its star, let alone the viewer - Tom\nCruise sings Bon Jovi and Def Leppard when playing a hair-metal divo alongside\nRussell Brand and Catherine Zeta-Jones in an adaptation of hit stage musical\n**_Rock of Ages_** (June 14), which could be hilarious in ways other than\nintended. Robert Pattinson endured such an experience when he left his\n_Twilight_ comfort zone for the risible _Little Ashes_ ; he'll be hoping his\ncollaboration with the masterful filmmaker David Cronenberg, the thriller\n**_Cosmopolis_** (August 30), fares better. Not that there won't be\nintentional laughs this season. The cream of the comedy crop looks like being\n**_Ted_** (July 12), the big-screen directorial debut of Seth MacFarlane, who\ncreated TV's much-loved _Family Guy_. It's about a man (played by Mark\nWahlberg) who has a teddy bear that comes to life. The irreverent MacFarlane\nalso voices the toy, so expect something closer in tone to _Wilfred_ than\n_Play School_.\n\nIf you pine for something more highbrow, there are three promising film\nfestivals to cater for your needs. There's a smorgasbord of world cinema,\nquality docos and art-house fare, amounting to more than 150 features, at the\n**Sydney Film Festival** (June 6-17, various venues, 9690 5333, ).\n\nOver at the **Spanish Film Festival** (July 4-15, Chauvel and Palace Norton\nStreet, ) see Salma Hayek in _As Luck Would Have It_ while keeping your eyes\npeeled for the new Almodovar.\n\nAnd the **Canadian Film Festival** returns to Dendy Opera Quays and Dendy\nNewtown from August 13-19, with 20 new feature films, plus guest filmmaker\nQ&As and parties (). **  \nGeorge Palathingal**\n\n### Stage ****\n\n**** Winter is chock-a-block with theatre, comedy and dance, starting with\nBelvoir's production of Matthew Whittet's exquisitely personal play about\ngrowing up, love and loss and fathers and sons, **_Old Man_** (June 7-July 1,\nvarious times, Belvoir St Theatre Downstairs, Surry Hills, 9699 3444, ,\n$42/$36/$32/$25). Directed by Anthea Williams, the show features Peter Carroll\nand Gillian Jones.\n\nIn a coup for the Concourse, the **English National Ballet** will play an\nexclusive 2012 Australian season in Chatswood (June 8-June 17, various times,\nPerforming Arts Centre, the Concourse, 1300 795 012, , $85-$195). The\nrepertoire features George Balanchine's _Apollo_ and Serge Lifar's _Suite en\nblanc_ , the Black Swan pas de deux from _Swan Lake_ Act III, Kenneth\nMacMillan's _Manon_ and Hans van Manen's _Trois Gnossiennes_.\n\nComedy duo Drew Fairley and Kate Smith return with another furious whirl of\nsnappy dialogue, modern farce and pop-culture references in **_The Unspeakable\nItch_** , with songs by Phil Scott (June 13-July 8, various times,\nDarlinghurst Theatre, Potts Point, 8356 9987, , $38/$33/$28).\n\n''In theatre \u2026 the writer is lying. The actors are lying. The audience is\nlying, too. The whole effect is one monumental idiotic lie.'' So says Bruscon,\nthe megalomaniacal protagonist in Austrian novelist and playwright Thomas\nBernhard's **_The Histrionic_** (Der Theatermacher). Translated by Tom Wright,\nthis Malthouse Theatre and Sydney Theatre Company production was called\n''appallingly funny'' by _The Age_. It features Bille Brown as Bruscon, with\nBarry Otto, Josh Price and Jennifer Vuletic (June 15-July 28, various times,\nWharf 1, Sydney Theatre, Walsh Bay, 9250 1777, , $79/$40).\n\nArthur Miller's great classic **_Death of a Salesman_** is reworked by\ndirector Simon Stone and features Genevieve Lemon and Colin Friels, who\nreturns to the Belvoir boards after 30 years (June 23-August 19, various\ntimes, Belvoir St Theatre, Surry Hills, 9699 3444, , $62/$52/$42/$29).\n\nLenny Henry's ode to music's role in his life, **_Cradle to Rave_** ,\ntraverses his devotion to Elvis, first love, learning the piano at 40 and\nfrustrated musical ambitions (June 28 and 29, 8pm, State Theatre, city, 1300\n139 588, , $109/$89/$84/$79). Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery **_The\nMousetrap_** , which holds the title of the world's longest-running show in\nits current season on London's West End, has an all-Australian production\n(June 30-July 27, various times, Sydney Theatre, Walsh Bay, 9250 1999, ,\n$100/$85).\n\nAustralian living treasure **Dame Edna Everage** unveils her farewell stage\ntour _Eat, Pray, Laugh!_ The Dame, and cohorts Sandy Stone, Sir Les Patterson\nand Barry Humphries, are not leaving showbiz - just dropping the touring life\n(July 5-July 14, various times, Capitol Theatre, city, 13 61 00, ,\n$199/$159/$99).\n\n ** _Face to Face_** , Ingmar Bergman's extraordinary film about the\npsychological maelstrom of one woman, has been adapted for the stage by Andrew\nUpton and Simon Stone. Kerry Fox plays the lead role, Jenny, alongside John\nGaden and Wendy Hughes (August 7-September 8, various times, Sydney Theatre,\nWalsh Bay, 9250 1777, , $130-$45).\n\nAustralia's annual international festival of dance, **Spring Dance** , is this\nyear curated by Rafael Bonachela, the artistic director of Sydney Dance\nCompany (August 20- September 2, various times, Opera House, Circular Quay,\n9250 7777, ). And the Pucci-clad, acid-tongued trolley dolly **Pam Ann** ,\nalter ego of comedian Caroline Reid, takes off with _Around the World_ (August\n3 and 4, 8pm, State Theatre, city, 13 61 00, , $60). **  \nLenny Ann Low**\n\n### Family ****\n\nAs every parent knows, hibernating through winter is no longer an option when\nyou have kids going crazy inside. Thankfully, there are plenty of fabulous\nactivities on offer to distract the tribe.\n\nIt's not winter without skating shows, and this year there are two big ones -\n**_Disney on Ice: Let's Celebrate_** (July 11-16, 11am and 2.30pm, Allphones\nArena, Olympic Park, 13 28 49, , $24.50-$69.50) and **_Nutcracker on Ice_**\n(June 6-10, 1pm and 7.30pm, Capitol Theatre, Campbell Street, Haymarket, 13 61\n00, , $69-151).\n\nIf you prefer to do the skating, visit the **Bondi Winter Magic** outdoor rink\n(June 29 to July 15, noon-10pm, 8362 3408, ).\n\nJunior builders should get to the **Sydney Brick Show** (June 2-3, 10am-5pm,\nPowerhouse Museum, Harris Street, Ultimo, 9217 0111, , $12 adult, $6 child,\n$30 family), which showcases fabulous Lego creations by Australia's best\nbuilders.\n\nMeanwhile, aspiring little adventurers will love **_Dora the Explorer Live!_**\n(July 4, 10.30am and 1pm, Concourse Theatre, Victoria Avenue, Chatswood; July\n6-7, Theatre Royal, King Street, city, 13 28 49, , $23-49).\n\nFor something truly out of this world, the winter holiday program at the\n**Sydney Observatory** (July 2-13, Observatory Hill, The Rocks, 9921 3485, ,\nvarious prices - see event schedule) features telescope and pizza nights,\nsimulated archaeological digs and 3D space films.\n\nBut if you truly want to blow the kids' minds, take them to the **Toy and Game\nExpo** (June 9-11, Sydney Showground, Olympic Park, 6287 4567, , $15 adult,\n$10 child). **  \nJason Treuen**\n\n### Art\n\nThere's no bigger art event in winter than **All Our Relations: The 18th\nBiennale of Sydney** (June 27-September 16, 8484 8700, ). Featuring the work\nof more than a hundred international and Australian artists, BOS18 is spread\nacross venues including the Art Gallery of NSW, Carriageworks, the Museum of\nContemporary Art, Pier 2/3 and Cockatoo Island. What better way to spend a\nwinter afternoon?\n\nWhile the behemoth of the BOS rolls on, there's plenty else to see.\n**Australian Symbolism** (until July 29, daily, 10am-5pm, Art Gallery of NSW,\nArt Gallery Road, The Domain, 1800 679 278) is the strange tale of 19th-\ncentury Australian artists experimenting with mystical European visions in a\nlocal setting.\n\n **Marc de Jong's** latest show tries to make sense of modern landscapes of\nshopping malls and hardware barns bigger than castles (July 10-August 4,\nSullivan+Strumpf, 799 Elizabeth Street, Zetland, 9698 4696).\n\nMeanwhile, **Chris Langlois's** landscapes have always had an old-world calm\nand his latest show demonstrates the artist's consummate skills with paint and\nclassical composition (July 24-August 18, Rex Irwin Art Dealer, 38 Queen\nStreet, Woollahra, 9363 3212). **  \nAndrew Frost  \n**\n\n", "url": "/entertainment/thrills-and-chills-20120524-1z603.html", "last_update": "2012-05-24T17:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Markets Live: Worst day of the year", "article": "**Australian shares were sold off today, posting their worst day of the year,\nas European election results that threaten the region's debt plans weighed on\nsentiment.**\n\n **4.55pm:** That brings our live coverage of today's market session to an\nend. Thanks for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back\ntomorrow morning at 9.30am.\n\nFor a wrap of today's session, .\n\n **4.45pm:** The growing uncertainty about the eurozone's future following\nelections in Greece and France over the weekend, saw investors rush to **safe\nhavens such as Australian government debt** today.\n\nThe three-year contract leapt 0.17 points to 97.330, its highest since 1992,\nwhile the 10-year contract exploded 0.15 points to 96.650, a fresh all-time\nhigh. Likewise, 10-year government cash bond yields hit new 60-year lows at\n3.40 per cent. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nAustralian bonds have been enjoying strong support from investors across the\nglobe worried about Europe and the United States. Australia is one of the few\nremaining AAA-rated countries in the world.\n\n **4.41pm:** The Australian dollar is hovering close to the year's low after a\nbroad retreat from risk on renewed economic concerns in the United States and\nEurope.\n\nThe Aussie dollar is trading around $US1.0157, having earlier touched\n$US1.0111, its lowest so far this year.\n\n\"We have a falling interest rate environment Down Under, global growth\nconcerns and a situation in Europe. It's all far greater than whether retail\nsales for one month were better than expected,\" says a trader at a European\nbank in Singapore.\n\n **4.35pm: French government bonds have opened lower** , driving the five-year\nyield three basis points higher to 1.63 per cent in early trade.\n\nThe 10-year yield rose four basis points to 2.86 per cent, while the two-year\nyield was little changed at 0.61 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, German 10-year bond yields fell as low as 1.552 per cent in early\ntrade, while Spain's 10-year yield jumped to 5.828 per cent, bringing it close\nto 6 per cent, which is considered an unsustainable level.\n\n **4.27pm:** Arafura Resources has **struck a deal with a mystery South Korean\nconglomerate** to potentially co-develop its Australian rare earths project,\nas Korea is forced to look beyond major producer China for its supply.\n\nThe name of the \"Korean multinational organisation\" involved with Arafura was\nnot released in an Arafura announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange\ntoday, although, Arafura did tell the market a memorandum of understanding had\nbeen signed between the pair.\n\nRare earths are a combination of key minerals needed in high tech products\nfrom smartphones to missile guidance systems. China accounted for nearly 80\nper cent of South Korean\u2019s rare earths imports last year, according to Korean\nCustoms Service data.\n\nArafura's shares closed flat at 25 cents, easily outperforming the rest of the\nmaterials sector.\n\n **4.19pm:** Here's how some of the **blue chips performed** today:\n\n  * BHP: -4%\n  * Rio: -4.5%\n  * Fortescue: -6%\n  * ANZ: -1.45%\n  * CBA: -1.1%\n  * NAB: -1.7%\n  * Westpac: -0.8%\n  * Woolies: -1.15%\n  * Wesfarmers: -1.4%\n  * Telstra: -1.4%\n\n**4.15pm:** All sectors closed in the red but **losses were led by the\nmaterials sector** , which plunged 3.6 per cent. Energy fell 3.4 per cent,\nconsumer discretionary lost 2.6 per cent and consumer staples were down 1.3\nper cent despite better than expected retail sales numbers and financials fell\n1.4 per cent.\n\n **4.12pm:** The market has closed just above the day's lows. The benchmark\nS&P/ASX200 index slumped 94.7 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 4301.3, while the\nbroader All Ords fell 97.8 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 4361.6.\n\n **4.07pm:** As the ASX does the final calculations for today's close,\n**European stock index futures are signalling sharp losses** , as election\nresults in Greece and France spark worries over public support for austerity\nmeasures seen by most investors as key to fixing the euro zone's debt crisis.\n\nFutures for Euro STOXX 50, for Germany's DAX and for France's CAC are down\n2.3-2.7 per cent. The UK market is closed for a holiday.\n\nS&P500 futures are down by a bit more than 1 per cent, indicating lower losses\nwhen Wall Street opens later today.\n\n **4.01pm:** With the government carrying on the time-honoured tradition of\nleaking, we already have **some idea of how tomorrow's budget will look**.\nHere\u2019s what we've gleaned so far:\n\n  * The introduction of a \u2018loss carryback\u2019 option for small business.\n  * A company tax cut of 1 percentage point to 29 per cent, assuming it gets through Parliament.\n  * Cash payments for parents. The \u2018Schoolkids Bonus\u2019 will give $820 for parents with teenagers at school and $410 for parents of primary school students.\n  * It will be given to recipients of Family Tax Benefit and does away with the need to keep education-related receipts. \n  * Pushing 100,000 sole parents off parenting payments and on to Newstart when their child turns eight, delivering $700 million in savings over four yeas.\n  * Welfare payments for people travelling overseas for more than six weeks will be cut. \n  * Billions of dollars in savings from the Defence budget.\n  * The superannuation contribution tax will be doubled to 30 per cent for people on incomes above $300,000.\n  * The living-away-from-home allowance for executives will be cut, saving $1 billion. \n  * Funding for the national disability insurance scheme, earmarked to start next year. Changes to aged care funding, as detailed in its recent aged-care report.\n  * About half a billion for dental care. \n  * Cuts to green schemes, to avoid duplication with the carbon tax. \n  * $3.5 billion in funding to finish the Pacific Highway dual carriageway.\n\n**And what is speculated:**\n\n  * Support for the manufacturing industry.\n  * An end to the 32\u00a2 a litre diesel fuel rebate.\n  * A skills package encompassing apprenticeships and vocational skills.\n\n**3.49pm:** WTI crude oil has dropped **well below the $US100 mark** , falling\nmore than $US3 a barrel, while Brent crude fell more than $US2.50 after the\nEuropean election results and poor US jobs data.\n\nUS crude was last at $US97.04 while Brent was at $US112.42.\n\nOil prices may fall further on \u2018\u2018lacklustre\u2019\u2019 macroeconomic conditions, easing\ngeopolitical tensions and bearish fundamentals, says Morgen Stanley head of\ncommodities research Hussein Allidina.\n\n **3.43pm:** Greece\u2019s election results **increase the risk of the country\nleaving the euro** within the next year to 18 months to as high as 75 per\ncent, Citi says.\n\nThe probability of such an event within the next 12 to 18 months is between 50\nper cent and 75 per cent, Guillaume Menuet and Juergen Michels write in a\nreport. They previously attached a 50 per cent likelihood to the risk.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, even after the elections in Greece, France and Germany, we regard\nthe probability of a broad-based break-up of the monetary union as very low,\u2019\u2019\nthe economists write. \u2018\u2018We continue to expect that in reaction to Greece\nleaving the euro area, more far-reaching measures from governments and the\u2019\u2019\nEuropean Central Bank \u2018\u2018would be put in place.\u2019\u2019\n\n **3.34pm:** The ASX200 has just dropped below 4300, for the first time in\nthree weeks. The current 2.2 per cent plunge is also the biggest drop in the\nmarket since December 19.\n\n **3.27pm:** Metals and mining stocks are down 4 per cent, financials are down\n1.4 per cent and the industrials sector is down 2.1 per cent.\n\n **3.22pm:** A bad day on the market just keeps getting worse. The **ASX200\nhas sunk to another low** \\- it's now down 88 points, or 2 per cent, to\n4307.8.\n\n **3.15pm:** An early test of the new Franco-German relationship will be\nwhether France's next president, Francois Hollande, backs Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to\ns as head of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, says the FT.\n\nFrench and German officials say however that a compromise on the fiscal\ndiscipline treaty agreed in March, despite Hollande\u2019s threats to reopen\nnegotiations. But two-round parliamentary elections in June mean Hollande will\nbe reluctant to concede too much.\n\n **3.08pm:** Leighton shares have dipped after the construction giant said\nthat the **completion date for Brisbane\u2019s Airport Link toll road** has been\npushed back by almost two months.\n\nThe company said this morning that the Airport Link should be open to traffic\non or before August 20, instead of the previous forecast of June 30.\n\nLeighton shares are down 2.8 per cent at $19.41.\n\n **3.04pm:** Financial spreadbetters **expect Europe's main stock indexes to\nsink** today, adding to the previous session's selloff as investors dump risky\nassets following elections in Greece and France that revived fears over the\neuro zone debt crisis.\n\nSpreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open around 152 points lower, or down\n2.3 per cent, and Paris's CAC 40 to open around 65 points lower, or down 2.1\nper cent. The market reaction will be exaggerated by a public holiday in\nBritain.\n\nLosses on Wall Street are expected to be lower, with S&P500 futures down about\n1 per cent.\n\n **3.01pm:** NAB has weighed in on the European election results and their\naffect on the euro:\n\n\u2018\u2018The Hollande win in France is not necessarily a surprise. However, it brings\nhome the reality that incumbents following the (European Union\u2019s) prescribed\nausterity measures are going to find it difficult to remain elected,\u2019\u2019\nNational Australia Bank says in a note.\n\n\u2018\u2018What happens to these austerity measures now is what is weighing on (the\neuro).\"\n\n **The euro skidded to $US1.2954** in early trade, its lowest level since late\nJanuary, while also slumping to 103.22 yen at one stage. It's currently buying\n$US1.2978 and 103.53 yen, still well down from $US1.3082 and 104.50 yen late\nFriday in New York.\n\n **2.56pm:** Looking ahead to tomorrow's federal budget, St George Bank chief\neconomist Hans Kunnen says **non-means tested benefits are likely to bear the\nbrunt of cuts**.\n\n  * Some of the target seems to be middle-class welfare and higher-income welfare, where benefits have not been means tested and people on high incomes are still getting benefits.\n  * We saw some of the aged care issues a month ago, when they changed funding for aged care, and there have also been changes to superannuation.\n  * It will be those sorts of things, not massive cuts. It\u2019s possible for them to find $2-3 billion relatively easily without crippling the economy.\n\n**2.48pm:** David Llewellyn-Smith in his piece  argues that Australian asset\nprices face a slump - the question is just will it be short and painful or\nsteady and manageable.\n\nFor the answer, he looks at the US and Japan as two countries that have\nexperienced major asset price deflation.\n\nThe US model is one: swift and painful house price falls, rocketing\nunemployment, as well as big falls in labour costs and a big jump in\nproductivity and a temporary surge in public borrowings.\n\nThe other model is that of Japan. Japan\u2019s asset price falls were paced over a\nmuch longer time period than those of the US or Europe.\n\nThe resulting economic shakeout was different too, with a much longer time\nframe of subdued economic growth, a more slowly rising unemployment rate and a\nsteady but longer rise in public borrowings to offset the private sector\u2019s\nslower paced deleveraging. In short, in Japan, collective private losses were\nsocialised over a much longer time frame.\n\nHere's an interesting **house price chart by Steve Keen** showing the US and\nJapanese paths, and an emerging Australian one:\n\n **2.40pm:** Two years ago, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens gave punters a\nvery public warning **not to bet on house prices rising** , writes Michael\nPascoe.\n\nIt turned out to be good advice.\n\nNow the RBA is pointing to housing remaining subdued until lower purchase\nprices, higher rental yields and population growth get us building again.\n\n **2.33pm:** If futures markets are on the money, markets in Europe and the US\ncould be in for a wild ride.\n\nFTSE futures are down almost 2 per cent, while US futures are down about 1 per\ncent. ****\n\n**2.25pm:** More on Holden... the car maker says its local operations are\n**viable and sustainable** but it doesn\u2019t expect to grow imports while the\ndollar remains high.\n\nThe company says car producers in Australia continued to face tough conditions\nwith disrupted supplies of components, unfavourable exchange rates and\nstronger competition from importers.\n\nHolden has a limited ability to compete with import companies that continued\nto chase aggressive pricing in the local market, chief financial officer\nGeorge Kapitelli says.\n\nBut he says Holden has made fundamental improvements to its cost base over the\npast two years, and the savings reflected in a brighter longer-term outlook\nfor the company.\n\n\u2018\u2018Plant utilisation has increased considerably and local production is viable\nand and sustainable with two car lines at Holden vehicle operations.\u2019\u2019\n\n **2.16pm:** Despite today's better than expected economic data, which has\ngiven the dollar some respite, the **bond market is continuing its remarkable\nrally**.\n\nYields on the 10-year bond dropped as low as 3.407 per cent this morning, and\nwere recently at 3.418 per cent.  \nIt was only last week that the yield dropped below 3.5 per cent, plumbing lows\nlast seen in the 1950s.\n\n **2.11pm:** CommSec's Craig James says the clear conclusion from today's\neconomic data is that the **Reserve Bank can cut rates again**.\n\n\"However the RBA is likely to take a few more months to weigh up all the\ninfluences. CommSec is pencilling in a rate cut in August after the next\ninflation data.\"\n\n **2.05pm:** Locally, gold stocks are down 1.6 per cent. Among the bigger\nparticipants in the sector, **Newcrest** is down 1.2 per cent, **Evolution\nMining** is down 3.6 per cent and **St Barbara** is down 1.6 per cent.\n\n **1.57pm: Gold prices are also lower** , pressured by a stronger greenback\nafter elections in France and Greece cast doubts on whether the euro zone will\nbe able to battle the debt crisis.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.2 per cent to $US1638.45 an ounce, off the low of $US1626.50\nhit on Friday.\n\n\"We really need to see economy much weaker before the central bank steps in,\"\nsays Dominic Schnider, head of commodity research at UBS Wealth Management in\nSingapore.\n\n\"For now the market is in risk aversion mode. With inflation threat out, oil\nprices coming off and QE hurdles really high in developed economies, gold is\nin a vulnerable position.\" ****\n\n**1.49pm:** ANZ head of Australian economics and property research Ivan\nColhoun says the job advertisement figures were **essentially in line with\nwhat was expected**.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think there are two issues - firstly, our estimates for this month\nsuggested that job adverts were weaker in April,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018\u2018That was pretty much across the board - every state, every territory, except\nfor the Northern Territory.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, there\u2019s been strength in WA in the last couple of months, so I\nwouldn\u2019t overplay weakness there.\n\n\u2018\u2018The second issue is that we have one data provider who may have been giving\nus inaccurate data. We\u2019re investigating that at the moment,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018\u2018ANZ is confident that the estimated drop in advertising of around three per\ncent reported in April is broadly correct.\u2019\u2019\n\n **1.41pm:** Another company feeling the pinch today is **Japanese electronics\ngiant Sony**.\n\nSony has dropped to its lowest level in 25 years on concerns that a weaker\neuro may hit Japanese exporters\u2019 sales in Europe.\n\nIts stock dropped as much as 4.4 per cent to 1214 yen - its lowest level since\nApril 25, 1987, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Japan\u2019s benchmark\nNikkei 225 Stock Average is down 2.6 per cent.\n\nOthers on the slide include Canon which has fallen 2.9 per cent and Panasonic\nwhich is down 3.5 per cent.\n\n **1:33pm: Oil prices are extending losses in Asian trade.**\n\nNew York\u2019s main contract, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in June\nstayed below the psychological $100 threshold, falling $US1.92 to $US96.57 a\nbarrel in morning trade.\n\nBrent North Sea crude for June shed $US1.48 to $US111.70.\n\n\u2018\u2018Oil has gone down sharply because the election results have raised concerns\nabout whether the eurozone can beat the debt crisis,\u2019\u2019 says Nick Trevethan,\nsenior commodities strategist at ANZ Research.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is a worry about a rejection of austerity and people are also worried\nabout a eurozone recession,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n **1.28pm:** Here's an update from markets across the region:\n\n  * Tokyo stocks are down 2.6 per cent\n  * Hong Kong stocks are down 2.4 per cent\n  * Shanghai stocks are down 0.14 per cent\n  * South Korea's Kospi is down 1.6 per cent\n  * New Zealand stocks are down 0.6 per cent\n\n**1.23pm:** A change of pace from the small business desk....blogger Tony\nFeatherstone questions the favourable coverage of entrepreneurs.\n\n ****\n\n _\"Entrepreneurs are partly to blame: they are only too happy to talk when\nthings go well, but rarely want to talk about failure or their insecurities\nfor fear it will damage their brand._\n\n _Consequently, we don\u2019t gain genuinely valuable insights into how they deal\nwith failure, and recover.\"_\n\n **1.18pm:** HSBC Australia chief economist Paul Bloxham says today's data\nshows **conditions in the retail and building sectors are improving**.\n\nFollowing that rate cut, both sectors are likely to continue to strengthen, he\nsays.\n\n\u2018\u2018These are the sectors, retail and housing, that are most interest rate\nsensitive; these are the parts of the economy that, when you get the effects\nof the RBA\u2019s cut, will see the most significant improvement.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018So they are already looking like they are picking up and bit and they will\nget an extra fillip from that rate cut.\u2019\u2019\n\n **1.10pm:** HIA Economist Geordan Murray says while the latest building data\nis positive, it follows an **8.8 per cent decline** for the previous month.\n\n\"The volume of building approvals in March still implies an annual rate of\naround 130,000 homes per annum which leaves the industry teetering on the\nverge recession,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe positive update in today\u2019s building approvals is driven by a rebound of\n49.3 per cent in New  \nSouth Wales which reclaimed some of the ground lost by the 41.4 per cent\nobserved last month. The  \nresurgence in NSW primarily occurred in the \u2018other dwelling\u2019 segment.\"\n\n **1:04pm: Commonwealth Bank will cut about 100 jobs** in Melbourne as it\nmakes changes to its mortgages business to deal with weak demand.\n\nCBA says it will close its mortgage services processing site in Melbourne at\nthe end of 2012, and move some of the processing services to interstate\ncentres.\n\nSome staff will be redeployed, but the restructure is expected to result in\naround 100 redundancies, the bank saiys.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our priority remains to redeploy the majority of the staff who work in that\ncentre and we have been successful in identifying alternative opportunities\nfor many of our staff,\u2019\u2019 the bank said in a statement. \u2018\u2018We will continue to\nwork our staff over the next six months.\u2019\u2019\n\n **12.52pm:** The dollar may is trading above the day's lows after receiving\nsome support from the economic data, but it's much **too early to call it a\nrecovery**. The Aussie is buying $US1.0135, up form a low of $US1.0110 this\nmorning but still well below Friday's local close of $US1.0264.\n\nJPMorgan's Ben Jarman says that weak US jobs data were the first catalyst in\npulling the Australian dollar down, followed by the success of anti-austerity\nleaders in European elections.\n\n  * It started with a disappointment in US payrolls, which didn\u2019t bode well for the currency,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Then we had the French and Greek election news, which has given markets some outcomes that they\u2019re not viewing too favourably.\n  * Hollande\u2019s victory looks like it could make relations with the Germans and the other policy-makers in Europe a bit more difficult.\n  * There could be more political ructions as they try to find a path between keeping the economy on-track and also delivering the austerity that markets want.\n\n**12.45pm:** Economists say the surprisingly strong retail sales and building\napprovals numbers mean there's less of a chance of a rate cut in June.\n\nMacquarie senior economist Brian Redican says the retail numbers are the ones\nthat really stand out:\n\n  * It certainly **reduces the chances of a follow-up move** by the Reserve Bank in the next couple of months.\n  * I don\u2019t think policy makers are going to be doing cartwheels in the street and saying its all up from here.T\n  * Two things that could be going here is firstly difficulty in finding that right balance between price cuts and volume increases. Secondly the month of March can be affected by the timing of Easter.\n\nJPMorgan economist Ben Jarman says the retail and building approvals numbers\nshow the **economy is in a better position** than previous data had suggested.\n\n  * In retail trade we have the strongest number for at least a year, which is surprising given the context we\u2019re looking at, with falls in consumer confidence and growing concerns about the global economy again.\n  * So it runs contrary to that, but if you look at the breakdown, there are some broad-based improvements.\n  * We don\u2019t think this means that consumers are getting excited, it\u2019s just a bit of stabilisation.\n\n**12.39pm:** Moving back to local news: **Holden is feeling the pinch** ,\nposting an $89.7 million after-tax profit for 2011, with the result impacted\nby a softening large car market and a shortage of some imported vehicles.\n\nHolden's revenue was $4.3 billion for 2011, down from $4.4 billion in 2010.\nIts profit result compared to the $112 million net profit the company reported\nin 2010.\n\nLocal vehicle production was up 36.8 per cent in 2011, with 90,424 cars built\nat its assembly plant in South Australia, compared to 66,061 in 2010.\n\n **12.35pm:** One US researcher says global markets, which are jittery\nfollowing European elections on the weekend, **are likely to give France\u2019s new\npresident a chance**.\n\n\u201cMarkets will not attack France right away,\u201d Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research\nfellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, .\n\u201cBut there is a risk that if Mr Hollande does not act early on, France will\nbecome the next sick man of Europe.\u201d\n\nMr Hollande vowed to unwind some of the austerity measures that his\npredecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, agreed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and\nother European officials.\n\n **12.33pm:** Not sure if investors are agreeing with Mr Krugman's assessment,\nas the ASX200 falls even lower...\n\n **What do you think: is it a good thing that Europe is likely to move away\nfrom its austerity commitments. Send us your comments.**\n\n **12.30pm:** Paul Krugman, on the other hand, writes in an op-ed piece for\nthe NYT that the European election results show time is clearly running out\nfor the strategy of recovery through austerity \u2014 :\n\n _Mr. Hollande\u2019s victory means the end of \u201cMerkozy,\u201d the Franco-German axis\nthat has enforced the austerity regime of the past two years.

It will have an impact on the world.\n\n**12.20:** And that's despite some  (retail sales and building approvals),\nwhich may actually boost local growth as the following economists have\ntweeted:\n\n **12.19pm:** Today's heavy losses are putting the local market on track for\nits **worst day since mid-February**.\n\n **12.15pm:** Regional markets have opened sharply lower, adding to the\npressure on local stocks (and explaining why we've just hit the day's lows):\n\n  * Japan (Nikkei): -2.4%\n  * Shanghai: -2%\n  * Hong Kong: -2.4%\n  * Taiwan: -2.1%\n  * Singapore: -1.6%\n  * South Korea: -1.7%\n\n**12.11pm:** Mining giants **BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto** are among those\nunder pressure - down 3.5 and 3.8 per cent respectively.\n\n **12.06pm:** Despite some positive economic news - the market has dropped to\nits **lowest point for the session**. The ASX200 is now down 76 points, or 1.7\nper cent, at 4318.2.\n\n **12.02pm: Conditions for businesses worsened** in April, as the gap between\nthe mining and non-mining sectors widened.\n\nThe National Australia Bank monthly business condition index fell to zero in\nApril from a reading of 3 in March.\n\n\"Conditions deteriorated across all industries in April, with the exception of\nmining and retail - with the latter's sales boosted by further aggressive\ndiscounting,\" says NAB's chief economist Alan Oster.\n\nBusiness conditions for mining stood at 53 points in April up from 31 in\nMarch, while conditions for retail rose to minus-3 in April from minus-15 in\nMarch. ****\n\n**11.58am:** More on the ANZ jobs data... the bank has noted that recently\nreported tentative strength in the labour market **may have been overstated**\nbecause of unreliable data it has received.\n\n\u201cANZ is currently investigating the reliability of data provided by a small\ninternet website, which has been driving the recent improving trend in overall\njob advertising,\u201d the bank says.\n\n **11.54am:** AMP Capital Investors head of Investment Strategy and chief\neconomist Shane Oliver says the positive result in the retail sector is \"being\ndriven by **price discounting** rather than underlying strength\".\n\n**11.45am:** The economic data continues to roll in... **Australian\nresidential building approvals** rose 7.4 per cent to 11,501 units in March.\n\nThis compares to a downwardly revised 10,710 units in February, seasonally\nadjusted.\n\nIn the year to March, building approvals were down 15.0 per cent, the ABS\nsays.\n\nEconomists\u2019 forecasts had centred on a 3 per cent rise in approvals in March.\n\n **11.40am:** In bad news for job seekers, **ANZ job ads** dropped 3.1 per\ncent in April. The bank, meanwhile, has acknowledged that it has had\nreliability issues with one of the data providers for the forward looking\nreading on the labour market.\n\n **11.37am: Retail trade rose** in the month to a seasonally adjusted $21.231\nbillion, compared to a upwardly revised $21.032 billion in February the ABS\nsays.\n\nFor the three months to March, retail spending rose 1.8 per cent.\n\n **11.34am: The dollar** has gained on the release, rising to $US1.0130.\n\n **11.30am: Retail sales** data from the ABS is in - and there's finally some\ngood news for the beseiged sector. Sales for March rose 0.9 per cent, well\nabove the expected 0.2 per cent gain.\n\n **11.25am: The dollar** , meanwhile, continues to be under pressure. It's now\nat its lowest point for the session, trading at $US1.0111.\n\n **11.18am** : Investors don't like the outlook for **Australia's retailers**\n, stripping more than 1.5 per cent from the some the major names so far:\n\n  * **Wesfarmers** \\- down 1.73%\n  * **Harvey Norman** \\- down 1.37%\n  * **David Jones** \\- down 2%\n  * **Myer** \\- down 2.48% \n  * **Woolworths** \\- down 0.78%\n\n**11.14am** : The big banks are weathering the storm today and remain well\nahead of the general market. An hour into today's session they are\noutperforming both the mining sector and the major retail stocks:\n\n  * **CBA** is 0.53% lower to $52.34\n  * **ANZ** is 0.81% lower to $23.25\n  * **NAB** is 1.1% lower to $24.86\n  * **Westpac** is 0.65% lower to $22.76\n\n**11.08am** : We\u2019ll also have a **rush of economic numbers** to digest in the\nnext few minutes.\n\nRetail sales for March will tell us how much the general consumer gloom has\ntranslated into actual spending (or the lack of it). The market is still\ntipping a 0.2 per cent increase for the month, matching the gain in February\n\nBuilding approvals for March will also be out. A 3 per cent month-on-month\ngain is tipped by economists, but the year-on-year number may look ugly \u2013 off\n18 per cent.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll get business conditions from NAB and job ads from the ANZ ... so\nit\u2019s a big pre-budget day of economic stats.\n\n **11.02am** : While we're on the subject of polls, Australians are **lowering\ntheir hopes for the dollar**. A Fairfax online poll today of about 3000 people\ntipped the Aussie would end the year below parity, and 75 per cent tip it will\nbe at parity or lower. .\n\n **10.55am** : Looking at this morning's poll, which just closed, 59 per cent\nof today's 2074 voters reckon the ASX200 will close more than 1 per cent\nlower. That's a pretty safe bet at this stage with the ASX200 back to a loss\nof 1.5 per cent.\n\nStill, spare a thought for the contrarians. Seventeen per cent predicted the\nmarket would close more than 1 per cent higher. .\n\n **10.54am** : **Whitehaven Coal is continuing its expansion** , launching a\n$172 million offer for NSW coal explorer Coalworks.\n\nWhitehaven took a 17 per cent share in Coalworks when it bought Aston\nResources for $720 million in April. Now, Whitehaven has offered $1 for each\nremaining Coalworks share in an off-market takeover bid, well above the 85.5\ncents the shares last traded at.\n\nEarlier this year, Whitehaven became the nation's biggest independent coal\nminer when it agreed a $2.5 billion takeover of Aston and a local coal\nexplorer, both controlled by electrician-turned billionaire Nathan Tinkler.\n\n **10.46am** : **Rio has clawed back some its early losses**. Its shares are\n3.02 per cent lower to $62.95. That's well ahead of the general market, which\nhit bottom at 1.5 per cent lower but has edged back to a loss of 1.3 per cent\ndown.\n\nWhy is it suffering such a rough start to the week? As resources writer Peter\nKer notes, it could have something to do with one of its mines in Guinea, West\nAfrica.\n\nInvestors could be reading reports out of London that a Chinese consortium is\ntrying to swoop on Rio\u2019s Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Perhaps more\nsignificantly, the benchmark iron ore price into China was slightly lower over\nthe weekend, falling $US2 to $US145 per tonne. This was largely due to an\nincreased amount of Brazilian iron ore coming onto the market.\n\nPerhaps punters are also taking some cover ahead of a Federal Budget tomorrow\nwhich could hit miners in a couple of places. ****\n\n**10.39am** : **ANZ has weighed in on interest rates** , reviewing its\nforecast of how many rate cuts the RBA has in store this year. In a note this\nmorning, ANZ writes:\n\n  * In Australia recent anecdotes on the mining sector have not been positive, and we have upgraded our forecasts to now look for an additional 75bp of rates cuts this year, on top of the 100bp already delivered so far this cycle. \n  * The tightness in fiscal policy likely to be formalised in tomorrow's budget will likely keep domestic sentiment under pressure, with consequent implications for the AUD. ****\n\nHow much of those cuts ANZ decides to pass on is another question altogether.\n\n **10.35am** : One reason for the dollar\u2019s retreat is that a weaker global\neconomy is likely to **prompt the Reserve Bank to cut official interest\nrates** again soon.\n\nThis morning, investors were viewing the likelihood of a rate cut of 25 basis\npoints when the central bank next meets on June 5 as a four-in-five chance. In\none year\u2019s time, the cash rate will be down to 2.75 per cent, according to\nCredit Suisse.\n\nIf true, that 2.75 per cent would be below the 3 per cent mark during the\ndepths of the global financial crisis.\n\nAs noted a few moments ago, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 share index is down\n2.8 per cent. Easy to see why: money is flooding into the yen as that currency\nresumes its haven status. ****\n\n**10.32am** : \"We\u2019ve got what may well prove to be the **next wave of\ninstability from Europe** ,\" says Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist in\nSydney at Westpac Banking Corp. \"There\u2019s a clear voter rejection of austerity\nevident.\"\n\nThe Australian dollar has continued losing ground, hitting $US1.0121 just a\nfew minutes ago, but falling as low as $US1.0110, the lowest since December\n29.

Not all companies trading yet.\n\n **10.05am** : Early take - shares have lost 0.8 per cent as the market opens.\nHow low will they go?\n\n **9.55am** : Latest figures show Australian building activity has continued\nto slide, due to weak demand and lower workloads.\n\nThe Australian Industry Group-Housing Industry Association\u2019s performance of\nconstruction index fell 1.3 points to 34.9 in April. A reading below 50\nindicates a contraction in activity and it means the index has been in\ncontraction for 22 months.\n\nThe figures show most of the weakness is due to a sharp drop in apartment\nbuilding activity, but house building is also weak.\n\n **9.51am** : We've got a busy day of economics releases ahead:\n\n  * Australian Industry Group/Housing Industry Association **performance of construction index (PCI)** for April - more on this in a moment\n  * Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) **retail trade data** for March\n  * **ABS building approvals** for March\n  * **ANZ job ads** for April\n  * **NAB business survey** for April\n\n**9.48am** : Where does that place markets today? IG Markets analyst Stan\nShamu said he believed shares would fall as much as 1.8 per cent.\n\n\"This basically erases all of last week\u2019s gains and leaves the market right\nnear the support (level) from a few weeks ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Several traders are likely to attempt buying this market after the sharp drop\nwe have seen from last week\u2019s high.\n\nHe added that there was likely to be \"significant volatility in today\u2019s\nsession as traders look to reposition themselves.\" ****\n\n**9.44am** : The US jobs news sent SPI futures down sharply, points to a loss\nof about 1.2 per cent at the open. The Australian dollar has also . The Aussie\ndollar shed 1 US cent when trading resumed this morning, sinking to as low as\n$US1.0145 - its weakest point since since January 9 this year.\n\nRobert Rennie, Westpac chief currency strategist, said he expects the dollar\nto test parity against the greenback soon.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be any great surprise that Hollande was going to win and the\nGreek elections were going to be extremely fractured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we awaken Monday morning and it feels as if suddenly the financial\nmarkets have woken up and begun to realise the potential implications.\u201d\n\n **9.41am** : Meanwhile in Greece, election results have raised fresh concerns\nabout that nation's willingness to stick to tough austerity measures as\nparties opposing more cuts, including neo-Nazis, won almost 60 per cent of the\nvote support at the polls.\n\n **9.38am** : But worries are also coming from Europe where election results\nover the weekend threaten to undo recent progress on the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nFrance has elected Francois Hollande as its first socialist president in 17\nyears.

Traders' expectations had fallen during the week,\nbut the softer jobs number missed even more pessimistic forecasts.\n\nIt was the third straight month in which hiring slowed, intensifying fears\nthat the US recovery is losing momentum and opening the door a bit wider for\nthe Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy.\n\n\"The bottom line is you don't have evidence that this economy has reached\nescape velocity,\" said Robert Tipp, an investment strategist at Prudential\nFixed Income.\n\n **9.32am** : Aussie shares appear to be in for a rough start to the week.\nWe'll look at the main reasons for the negative leads in a moment.

{"title": "Indonesia's poor can't afford beef", "article": "IN 1963 I was sent as a correspondent to Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, a most\nbeautiful place, and I began learning some amazing truths. One was that\npoverty ain't necessarily poverty.\n\nIf you live in the wet tropics, have access to clan land, can fish a bit, keep\na few chooks (and a buffalo, goat, or pig), glean from the bush, and earn a\nfew dollars from selling crafts or garden excess, you might have a cash income\nof a dollar a day, but you are living in paradise.\n\nAlan Oxley argues that the live cattle export ban will take food from the\nmouths of the poor (''Cattle ban will mean food shortage for Indonesia's\npoor'', Comment, 9/6). It won't. The poor don't get to see Australian beef; it\nis an expensive food and reserved for the rich (who are extremely rich) and\nthe well-off (who are very well off; there are more of them in Indonesia than\nin Australia).\n\nThe poor deal in tens, hundreds and perhaps thousands of rupiah - the\nequivalent of Australian cents. Cents don't buy you expensive imported beef.\nSure, people in these places need help, particularly with education, training\nand health care, but they aren't going to starve for lack of Australian beef.\n\n **Geoffrey Heard, Mentone**\n\n### Industry lost gamble\n\nBEEF and lamb producers know Australians don't accept animal abuse of any\nkind. They know every aspect of their industry must treat animals with\nrespect, and that when abuse occurs the people will agitate for their elected\nrepresentatives to stop such activities.\n\nSome people in the industry clearly knew animals were being abused but\naccepted this to keep doing business. This was a high-risk gamble that relied\non the rest of us remaining unaware of the abuse. The decision to take the\ngamble was theirs and they now have to wear the consequences.\n\n **Matthew Read, Northcote**\n\n### Profits of cruelty banked\n\nNOT only did the cattle industry's peak body, Meat and Livestock Australia,\nknow exactly what was happening in Indonesian slaughterhouses, it deliberately\nand carefully made promotional videos designed to mislead and to cover up the\nnature of the cruelty.\n\nWe should compare two industries, the banking and cattle industries. When ATMs\nwere introduced, tens of thousands of bank staff had to find other employment.\nThe cattle industry by contrast has knowingly banked the profits of cruelty\nfor more than 15 years and now, when its scam has been exposed, it wants\ncompensation.\n\n **Geoff Russell, St Morris, SA**\n\n### Anything for a quid\n\nBARNABY Joyce says: \"Don't think that these barbaric processes will not\ncontinue. They will just continue without our cattle.\" There you have it. We\nmight as well accept barbaric processes and make a quid. This fits in nicely\nwith his party accepting money from big tobacco producers. Smoking kills\npeople too - but we might as well make a quid from it if it is not illegal.\n\n **Alan Inchley, Frankston**\n\n### Stress means tough meat\n\nI WAS born and bred on a farm in northern Victoria. One of the early things my\nfather taught me was how to slaughter a young sheep. The principles were to\ntreat the animal as gently as possible, cut its throat quickly and\nefficiently, breaking the neck instantly to end its life as painlessly as\npossible. Why? To ensure the meat was as tender and undamaged as it could be,\nand that the animal suffered minimum stress and pain.\n\nLambasting the Indonesians about cruelty won't get us anywhere. In co-\noperation with the Indonesian government we should mount a vigorous education\nprogram to persuade all those engaged in slaughtering animals that they are\nharming their own interests. They are guaranteeing the meat will be tough and\nalmost certainly bruised. All slaughterhouses should be compelled to stun\ncattle first or lose access to Australian beasts.\n\n **Don Lancaster, Prahran**\n\n### Confused objectives about Afghanistan\n\nI AM open on the question of whether or not Australian troops should remain in\nAfghanistan, but am annoyed that neither side appears to have thought through\ntheir case.\n\nFirst, this has nothing to do with guaranteeing Australia's safety from\nterrorist attacks. Even if all Islamist organisations were eradicated from\nAfghanistan, they or similar extremist groups would simply operate from\nelsewhere - including Western countries.\n\nSecond, there are strong historical precedents for Australia to act as a\nresponsible global citizen by co-operating in liberating other countries and\npeoples from oppressive regimes, even when there is no direct benefit to us.\n\nFor example, neither Hitler's Nazis nor Kim Il-sung's communists during the\nKorean War posed a direct threat to Australia, vile and repulsive though both\nwere. But no one in their right mind would argue it was wrong for Australia to\nbe involved in fighting them.\n\nThird, we cannot take on every unsatisfactory situation in the world, so when\nwe do commit ourselves, we should do so seriously or not at all.\n\nThe entrenched theocracy, tribalism, misogyny and other evils of Afghanistan's\nculture and society are not going to be rectified overnight, so the Australian\ngovernment needs to either undertake to stay on for the long haul, or get out\nimmediately, rather than hang around for another pointless two or three years.\n\n **Bill James, Bayswater**\n\n### Dying for nothing\n\nTHURSDAY, June 7, was the anniversary of the death of my son Andrew, who was\nkilled in a tragic tank accident at Puckapunyal in 1984. He was 25.\n\nOn the radio news on June 7, I heard that another young man had been killed in\nAfghanistan.\n\nHow many families are going to mourn the deaths of their beautiful young sons\nwhile this obscene war continues? It will never be won because neither the\ntribal nor the religious opponents will ever surrender.\n\nWhy are our sons dying for nothing? I still grieve for Andrew as I do for all\nthe other affected families. A death is a death no matter how it happens in\nthe armed forces.\n\nWhy do the powers that be still want it to continue? Who benefits? Certainly\nnot the bereaved families.\n\n **Sonia Paterson, Mont Albert**\n\n### Slaves to US policy\n\nTHERE are two answers to John Henry's question about why the government\ncontinues with the Afghanistan war despite public negativity (Letters, 9/6).\n\nThe first is that the government cares more about the feelings of the US\ngovernment than those of the Australian people. Second, the opposition,\nrunning negative campaigns against all other government projects, cares just\nas little for the Aussie Diggers' lives.\n\n **Lance Fishman, Upwey**\n\n### Living tragedies\n\nI CONCUR with your editorial ''Troops poorly served by flag-draped leaders''\n(8/6). The injured soldiers who return with permanent physical and mental\ninjuries are an equally significant tragedy. They are forgotten even before\nthey arrive back in Australia. Nearly 300 Australian soldiers have received\nserious physical injuries in Afghanistan. Many are put in rehabilitation\ncentres to spend the rest of their lives in isolation.\n\nThe US Defence and Veterans' Affairs departments reported in February 2009 a\nstaggering figure of 400,304 veterans with mental illnesses, almost five times\nthe number of dead and injured. On that basis, the number of mentally injured\nAustralian soldiers returning from Afghanistan could be reckoned at\napproximately 1500. Mentally-ill returned soldiers soon find that family life\nbreaks down, and society has little understanding or tolerance of their\nplight. Many will become unemployed or unemployable.\n\nAs Julia Gillard expresses her sorrows for the dead soldiers, she ignores the\nsuffering of the mentally and physically injured soldiers, who are equally\ngreat and living tragedies.\n\n **Bill Mathew, Parkville**\n\n### Data manipulated for good reason\n\nIF HEALTH Minister Nicola Roxon really does claim that the new hospital\nwatchdog will not encourage manipulation, she must be living in another world\n(''Fears of hospital data-fudging'', _The Age_ , 9/6).\n\nHospitals struggle to perform because they are expected to do the impossible\nwith inadequate resources. How do they get surgery done when the specialists\nare working next door in the taxpayer-funded private hospital?\n\nHow do they fit patients into beds when the beds are taken by patients waiting\nfor aged care places? How do they stop patients coming to emergency requiring\nadmission for problems that could and should have been treated in the\ncommunity? How do they manage a budget that is missing the fair and historical\n50-50 federal/state funding split?\n\nThey manipulate data to avoid financial punishment and a worsening of their\nposition. The struggle to perform is related mainly to federal government\npolicy and we are still awaiting the federal reforms to tackle the issues\nraised above.\n\n **Tim Woodruff, president, Doctors Reform Society, Richmond**\n\n### Dalai Lama off list\n\nTHE Prime Minister sees fit to not only meet, but share the stage with, Oprah\nWinfrey during her recent Australian visit.\n\nBut no such courtesy has yet been extended to the Dalai Lama (''Dalai Lama\nshow on a higher plane'', _The Age_ , 9/6). Again, we are left wondering who\nis advising Julia Gillard. What dignity is she displaying when she has time\nfor circuses but is not willing to stand up for matters of global and ethical\nsignificance. Roll up, roll up.\n\n **Elizabeth Potter, Brighton**\n\n### Battery hen cruelty\n\nANYBODY would be rightly disgusted at the methods of slaughter as witnessed in\nthe Indonesian abattoirs. But the tone of smug, self-righteous superiority of\nmany responses, implying that Australians are so much better, isn't warranted.\n\nVisit a battery-hen ''farm'' and see for yourself the conditions in which more\nthan 10 million ''Australian hens'' live producing 92 per cent of our eggs.\n\nWe've known about this for decades and nothing has been done about it. As we\nrightly condemn the cruelty inflicted on cattle in Indonesia, we stand\ncondemned by the torture we inflict on battery-hens in Australia. The\nbarbarism of battery-hen ''farming'' must be outlawed in its entirety,\neffective immediately.\n\n **David Bond, Bardon, Queensland**\n\n### Palm oil call no ploy\n\nALAN Oxley attacks calls to label the presence of palm oil in products as\nsimply a ploy by activists (Comment, 9/6).\n\nMy husband has a severe heart problem. At heart-smart classes for heart\npatients and diabetics we were advised to avoid palm oil at any cost.\n\nI spent hours on the phone trying to find out what the vegetable oil, as\nlisted in many products, actually consisted of. Invariably, it is palm oil or\na mix of another oil and palm oil. It's time all ingredients were listed on\nproducts.\n\n **Fay Woodrow, Hampton**\n\n### Rural drivers hit\n\nRACV calls for a distance tax instead of a fuel tax shows once again the\ncomplete lack of understanding of the position of country motorists (''RACV\nbacks global call for fuel tax switch'', _The Age_ , 6/6).\n\nIn peak periods, the average city motorist travels at between 30 and 40km/h\nand belches emissions into the atmosphere for approximately one hour twice a\nday.\n\nWe country travellers average between 90 and 100km/h for about 30 minutes\ntwice a day. My car averages 9.5 litres per 100 kilometres in the city and 5.5\nlitres per 100 kilometres in the country. And unlike in the city, we have _no_\npublic transport\n\n **Rodney Barkman, Corowa**\n\n### Low moral ground\n\nTHE federal opposition would be well advised not to position itself on the\nhigh moral ground when it comes to the way this country handles asylum\nseekers. Having the lesser of two evils when it comes to ''flawed populist\npolicy'' is nothing to crow about. Instead of being proud of pandering to the\nlowest denominator, both sides should be ashamed at how they have handled a\nproblem that is effectively a storm in a teacup. **Dallas Fraser, Mudgeeraba,\nQueensland**\n\n### Solution is rail\n\nRAIL is the solution to the diesel poisoning suffered by the Yarraville\nresidents. Sending containers from the port to distribution centres, and then\non to regional areas, all by rail, would solve inner-city air poisoning and\ncongestion. But do you really think the road lobby or state government would\nbe interested?\n\n **Rod Oaten, Carlton North**\n\n### \u2026AND ANOTHER THING\n\n###  **Live cattle trade**\n\nNOT only is the industry guilty of exporting cattle knowing the treatment that\nawaits, but it has systematically exported jobs.\n\n **Hans Paas, Castlemaine**\n\nI AM looking forward to cheaper beef now that there will be a glut of cattle.\nOr does that principle only apply in reverse when there is a shortage,\nparticularly of bananas.\n\n **Blair Davis, Castlemaine**\n\nBARNABY Joyce says animal abuse will continue, just with someone else's\ncattle. Yet Indonesia is threatening to take Australia to the WTO to force a\nresumption of trade. Why would it bother if cattle could be easily obtained\nfrom a third party?\n\n **James Taylor, Oakleigh South**\n\nSOMEONE blamed the ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia on \"do-gooders\".\nDoes he regard his own side as \"do-badders\"?\n\n **Colin Smith, St Kilda**\n\n###  **Politics**\n\nTHE editorial (9/6) says the cruel, senseless slaughter (in the live cattle\ntrade) must stop. And so, too, in Afghanistan.\n\n **Barry Revill, Moorabbin**\n\nMEDIA coverage of cattle being mistreated resulted in a rapid response by\ngovernment. Could we have similar coverage of refugees self-harming due to\nmandatory detention?\n\n **Colin Campbell, Bendigo**\n\nSO WE need to \"process\" cattle here first, and we also \"process\" detained\nrefugees. Quite a disturbing use of language.\n\n **Anthony Buckle, St Leonards**\n\nINDUSTRY groups around the world, like in US finance and Australian beef,\ndemand the right to self-regulate, but then demand that governments sort out\nany consequent mess.\n\n **Roger Hehir, East Malvern**\n\n###  **And finally**\n\n''OLD soldiers never die, they just fade away'' is an old army ballad. How\nmany of our young in Afghanistan will become ''old soldiers''?\n\n **Myra Fisher, Brighton East**\n\nGOD bless you, Leunig (Comment, 8/6). Hit the nail right on the head, again.\n\n **Ross Cropley, North Ringwood**\n\nLEFT-HANDERS are apparently disadvantaged ( _The Age_ , 9/6). Tell that to\nRafael Nadal.\n\n **Lance Cranage, Mount Waverley**\n\n", "url": "/politics/federal/indonesias-poor-cant-afford-beef-20110609-1fuvn.html", "last_update": "2011-06-09T14:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "On course to suffer global warming of four degrees", "article": "There is only one way to frame the weekend's carbon tax announcement: a start.\nAssume Australia hits its very soft target, cutting annual greenhouse gas\nemissions five per cent by 2020 - and the rest of the world does everything\nthey've promised - we are on course to suffer global warming of 4 degrees or\nmore by the end of the century.\n\nWe have already warmed the planet by 1 degree, relative to pre-industrial\ntimes, and are almost certainly experiencing an associated increase in costly,\nextreme weather events to say the least. In Australia, while it is impossible\nto be definitive about the cause of any single weather event, a list of prime\nsuspects includes last decade's crippling drought, Victoria's Black Saturday\nbushfires of 2009 and this year's devastating floods.\n\nNot scary enough for some, but as our chief climate change adviser, Ross\nGarnaut, warned earlier this year, ''if we are seeing an intensification of\nweather events now, you ain't seen nothing yet''.\n\nAustralia would need to lift its 2020 emissions reduction target to at least\n25 per cent to play our fair share in giving the world a better-than-even\nchance of limiting warming to 2 degrees (the threshold level for potentially\ndangerous climate change), as governments agreed at the 2009 Copenhagen\nclimate change summit and confirmed at Cancun.\n\nCross-party agreement on cuts of that order is hard to imagine in this country\nright now and the debate seems headed the other way in the US, which is alone\nresponsible for 30 per cent of accumulated emissions between 1850 and 2002.\n[That figure is from a 2005 World Resources Institute study. Rounding out the\ntop five were Europe (27 per cent), Russia and China (8 per cent each) and\nIndia (2 per cent). Australia ranked 15th, at 1 per cent of historical\nemissions]. On Tuesday, the EU voted against increasing its 2020 emissions\nreduction target from 20 to 30 per cent, absent from an international\nagreement.\n\nAt the end of May, the International Energy Agency warned that energy-related\nCO2 emissions had bounced right back from the financial crisis to reach a\nrecord high in 2010 and the prospect of limiting warming to 2 degrees was\n''getting bleaker''.\n\nBecause most power stations that will be operating in 2020 are either built or\nunder construction, the IEA said 80 per cent of projected 2020 emissions from\nthe power sector were already locked in.\n\nIEA chief economist Fatih Birol told the _Guardian_ the two-degree goal was\nlikely to be a ''nice Utopia''.\n\nHe continued: ''I am very worried. This is the worst news on emissions. I was\nexpecting a rebound, but not such a strong one. Room for manoeuvre is\nshrinking. This should be a wake-up call.''\n\nWith low expectations for the climate change conference in Durban, South\nAfrica later this year, there is now every chance the world will reach no\nbinding agreement at all to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond the first\ncommitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.\n\nWe can't all wait for each other to act. Australia at last is diving in, but\nthere's a long hard swim ahead of us. If a carbon tax of $23 a tonne, rising\nsharply to drive emissions reductions of 5 per cent, sounds like a lot of\neffort and expense, it's a fraction of what we need to do to stop dangerous\nwarming.\n\nWithout herculean effort we're on our way to a 4 degree warmer world. Indeed,\none WikiLeaks diplomatic cable, published by the _Herald_ last December,\nshowed that's what our top intelligence agency, the Office of National\nAssessments, expects: 2 degrees warming by 2050 and 4 degrees by 2100.\n\nA confidential briefing given by the ONA deputy director, Heather Smith, to\nthe US embassy said south east Asia would be the region worst affected by\nclimate change with decreased water flows from the Himalayan glaciers\ntriggering a ''cascade of economic, social and political consequences''.\n\nAccording to the leaked cable, Smith told the embassy the effects would be\ndestabilising south east Asia by 2030: ''South east Asia faces wild monsoons\nvariations, with effects on littoral infrastructure, agriculture, marine\ncurrents and fish stocks. Coastal cities to be hit by subsidence and rising\nsea levels.''\n\nA conference in Melbourne this week, featuring a who's who of climate\nscientists, will explore what warming of 4 degrees or more means, including\nfor Australia.\n\nKeynote speaker Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam\nInstitute and climate advisor to the German Chancellor and to the EU, has\npreviously said, in a 4 degree warmer world, the population '' \u2026 carrying\ncapacity estimates [are] below one billion people.\"\n\nSimilarly, Professor Kevin Anderson, the director of the Tyndall Centre for\nClimate Change in the UK, was quoted in _The Scotsman_ newspaper, ahead of the\n2009 Copenhagen climate summit, saying the consequences of a 4 degree world\nwere ''terrifying''.\n\n''For humanity, it's a matter of life or death \u2026 we will not make all human\nbeings extinct, as a few people with the right sort of resources may put\nthemselves in the right parts of the world and survive. But I think it's\nextremely unlikely that we wouldn't have mass death at 4[degrees]C. If you\nhave got a population of nine billion by 2050, and you hit 4, 5 or\n6[degrees]C, you might have half a billion people surviving.''\n\nAustralian climate scientist David Karoly, alongside Melbourne University and\nCSIRO colleagues, will give a paper next week on likely changes to our climate\nin a 4 degrees scenario. They are exceedingly grim but Professor Karoly - who\nhas warned ''we are unleashing hell on Australia'' - says he can't answer\nquestions about Australia's likely carrying capacity, which depends on\nvariables, like future willingness to pay, lifestyle and innovation. The\nhotter it gets, he says, ''it just gets harder and harder to support more\npeople''.\n\nIn a recent blog posting David Spratt, co-author of _Climate Code Red_ , drew\nthe threads together on the implications of 4 degrees warming, and put them in\nplain language. The world would be warmer than during any part of the period\nin which modern humans evolved, he wrote, and the rate of climate change would\nbe faster than any previously experienced by humans. Three degrees may be the\n''tipping point'', where global warming could be driven by positive feedbacks,\nleaving us powerless to intervene as planetary temperatures soared and\n(quoting NASA climate scientist James Hansen) there will be ''no return within\nthe lifetime of any generation that can be imagined, and the trip will\nexterminate a large fraction of species on the planet''. Half the world would\nbe uninhabitable, food and water supplies insecure. Ocean ecosystems and food\nchains would collapse. ''And we are talking about how we might adapt to a\n4-degree warmer world,'' Spratt writes. ''Have we gone mad?''\n\n **This reporter is on Twitter:**\n\n", "url": "/business/on-course-to-suffer-global-warming-of-four-degrees-20110708-1h6mh.html", "last_update": "2011-07-08T14:00:00Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Earth sacrificed on economic altar", "article": "THE carbon pollution reduction scheme is fatally flawed. Federal Labor has\nconcocted a half-baked scheme which seeks to resuscitate the economy, when the\nghastly reality of objective science tells us our planet is the patient, under\ncontinued relentless attack from the toxic virus of modern growth economics.\nClimate change is just one of many human-induced impacts that have made the\nglobal environment so sick. By putting economic growth, somehow magically\ndecarbonised, as a sacred goal, this scheme seeks to perversely preserve our\nunsustainable globalised consumer society.\n\nNone of the orthodox economic models of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural\nand Resource Economics, Treasury or Garnaut are rooted in the physical\nrealities of physics, thermodynamics or finite resources. These flawed models\nwill continue to speak with great certainty about leading us to a sustainable\nfuture, when the sad reality is that they will lead us to accelerating self-\ndestruction. Our survival depends on jettisoning suicidal neo-liberal\neconomics, in favour of sidelined CSIRO modelling based on firm scientific\nprinciples. How bad does life under business-as-usual have to get before we\nsnap out of our group delusion?\n\nMichael Gunter, North Melbourne\n\n### The price of consumption\n\nIF DECREASING the emission of greenhouse gases is a laudable policy objective,\nthen we are beginning to see the inevitable impact of increased prices leading\nto reduced consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This will include\nreductions in discretionary expenditure items including power, transport and\nfood, which are now becoming evident, impacting on rich and poor alike. The\ninevitable effect of carbon taxes is that everybody, rich and poor, must\nultimately reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, and without compensating\ntechnological advances, living standards for all will fall as a result.\n\nThe stated intention of the Rudd Government now is for the \"wealthy\" to carry\nthe burden for carbon taxes. Not only will the wealthy have to bear their own\ncosts, but they must bear the costs of the poor as well. If one considers that\nthe objective is to reduce the use of fossil fuels, there are limits to what\nyou can do with compensation. Compensating the poor who will therefore not\nreduce consumption runs counter to the policy of reducing emissions. Why\nshouldn't the poor be reducing their consumption as well to save the planet?\n\nGreg Angelo, Balwyn North\n\n### Climate politics 101\n\nI THINK I have got a handle on Kevin '07 and this carbon trading thing.\nAustralia is responsible for some 1% of carbon output so nothing we do to\nreduce this will fix global warming. On the other hand, if the rest of the\nworld does nothing, Australia has had it, because we are on the continent most\nvulnerable to temperature rises on the planet.\n\nSo what we do about carbon has to be credible so that Kevin '07 can go plead\nwith the rest of the world to reduce carbon output and save our bacon. That\ndoes not mean killing off the carbon polluters in one fell swoop and thereby\nwrecking our economy. That could bring the Coalition back to power at the next\nelection and then nothing will be done to save our country from the\ndestruction caused by rising temperatures.\n\nHans Paas, Castlemaine\n\n### More carrots, fewer sticks\n\nTHE not-very-green paper proposes a stick to make us cut down on petrol, but\nalso a cushion to cover our backsides. Why don't they appease us with carrots?\nFor instance, by providing more and better public transport. And taking the\nGST off public transport tickets rather than reducing fuel excise. And\nrevising car registration fees \u0097 using a sliding scale so hybrids incur zero\nfees and Hummer owners pay extra.\n\nColin Smith, St Kilda\n\n### Playing the fool\n\nUNDER Kevin Rudd's emission reduction scheme, what incentive is there for the\npolluters to cut their emissions if they can pass all their extra costs to\ntheir customers? The scheme will create a new bloated bureaucracy to\nestablish, monitor and police a law that will not create a single drop of\nextra rain. It merely proves the old saying that you can fool all the people\nsome of the time.\n\n **Gert Silver, Kew**\n\n### Abuse is a crime\n\nI HAVE never understood why the victims and families of children abused by\nCatholic priests think they will be satisfied after complaining to the church\nhierarchy. Being fobbed off with platitudes about healing and receiving\napologies from bishops who were eventually cornered into making admissions, is\nnever going to help them get back to normal, if this is possible at all.\n\nWhy should any church be exempt from feeling the full weight of the law? These\npriests did not just sin, they broke the law. There are also laws that apply\nto aiding and abetting law-breakers. Perverting the course of justice would\nseem to apply in many cases where abusers have been protected.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars of church offerings, collected at Mass from\nthose seeking spiritual comfort, is a grotesque and insufficient redemption\nfor the vile deeds perpetrated. For priests and some bishops to be seen in\nhandcuffs, the same as other alleged criminals, would give the rest of us\nconfidence that we are all equal under the law.\n\nRoger Green, Ferntree Gully\n\n### Ripple effects\n\nDOESN'T the church celebrate Jesus' pain and suffering every year? Isn't the\nongoing division between Christian and Islamic religions something that has\nexisted for more than a few years? A family that has been destroyed by the\nconsequences of acknowledged sexual abuse by a Catholic priest is not some\narbitrary reheating of yesterday's sins for breakfast. I would challenge any\nparent in their situation to accept the ignorant and wilfully unkind words of\nBishop Fisher ( _The Age_ , 17/7). He fails to understand the ripples\ngenerated by abuse. Many generations pay the price, not just the abused.\n\nLisa Dooley, South Melbourne\n\n### Scars still fresh\n\nBISHOP Fisher, you say \"we are enjoying the goodness of these young people (at\nthe World Youth Day) and the hope for us doing these sorts of things better in\nthe future\" and \"people are dwelling crankily on old wounds\". How will these\ngood things happen in the future if you continue to label survivors of sexual\nabuse by Catholic priests and brothers in this way?\n\nThey are not old wounds \u0097 they are new, ever present, being relived \u0097 every\ntime survivors hear a priest, cardinal or whoever represents the Catholic\nChurch show no respect for them or acknowledge the effect the abuse has had on\ntheir entire lives \u0097 in my case 40 years.\n\nName withheld by request\n\n### Alienated by church of man\n\nI AM a woman of strong faith and a committed Catholic. I am impressed and\ninspired by the faith, commitment and energy of the young people attending\nWorld Youth Day (WYD). However, I am moved to write about the deep pain I\nexperienced, as always, when confronted with the sea of men, leaders of the\nchurch, at the WYD Mass.\n\nI wonder when these leaders will be moved to recognise and respect the true\ndignity and equality of women whom they exclude from participation in\nleadership and decision-making roles. What a different experience it would\nhave been for the young women (and men) pilgrims to see a leadership truly\nshared by the church's women and men.\n\nUntil leaders of all religions offer women the respect of equal status, there\nwill be implicit rationales for unjust treatment of women, including\ndomination, exploitation, abuse and violence.\n\nMarie R. Joyce, Kew\n\n### Connex and its cunning plan\n\nWHILE being accosted by a rude and unfriendly ticket inspector this morning,\nit occurred to me why Connex and the Government employ such adversarial\ntactics, and it's the same reason we won't see tram conductors returning any\ntime soon. Basically, they don't care if they lose passengers, er, I mean\ncustomers. The public transport system has enough passengers (too many in\nfact) and the operators feel they don't need to provide a reliable, friendly\nservice in order to attract more \u0097 because they don't want any more.\n\nMore passengers just slow down the running of trains and trams that are\nalready at capacity. Britain's (failed) train privatisation resulted in\nmassive fare increases to drive down demand; Melbourne is choosing to use\nticket inspectors to the same end.\n\nVictor Rajewski, West Melbourne\n\n### Loopy logic\n\nIT'S a strange world on Planet Connex. Mark Paterson (Letters, 16/7) agrees\nwith the central argument of my report on rail capacity, then says it proves\nme wrong. The 1969 transport plan proposed building the City Loop, plus a\nseries of suburban rail extensions. In the 1970s, rail managers said the\nsuburban extensions couldn't go ahead until central city rail capacity was\nexpanded by building the loop. When the loop opened in the 1980s, it had cost\nso much money that the suburban extensions were abandoned.\n\nAs the loop has been completed, and we are carrying far fewer trains and\npassengers than it was designed to handle, we should be building those\nsuburban train lines. But Mr Paterson says we now need to build a second even\nmore expensive city loop before we can have any extensions. As this will take\nuntil 2020, we'll have to wait decades before anything happens. By that time,\nPerth will have a bigger rail system than Melbourne, including a line to the\nairport.\n\nPaul Mees, senior lecturer in transport planning, RMIT University\n\n### On the buses\n\nWE'RE on our annual pilgrimage to Boston, US. Took the 77 bus yesterday from\nArlington to Harvard Square \u0097 40 cents each way on seniors' rates. A bus about\nevery 10 minutes. Bus drivers don't handle money. There are three options for\nfare payment: by correct amount in coin, by ticket into slot, by electronic\nbeep (by far the most favoured means of payment). Simple, uncomplicated. On\nthe return trip the bus loaded quickly and efficiently at Harvard station. We\nwere on our way in no time. Maybe our Transport Minister could include Boston\nin her next study trip.\n\nRichard J. Stratford, Portarlington\n\n### Too much equity\n\nWHEN I read about the call for universities to place less emphasis on the\nENTER score ( _The Age_ , 17/7) I thought it was a joke. That's exactly what\nuniversities are becoming. It's all good and well to believe in equity for all\nstudents; to enable anybody the chance to succeed. However, reducing\nuniversity entry to a matter of vague interviews, subjective judgements by\nanonymous, unchecked, mediocre administrators and obscure pity-based entry\nsystems is not acceptable as a panacea to all of our social problems.\n\nIf you want a system where you give everybody a fair shot at university, then\nwhy not get serious about student welfare and youth allowance criteria?\nThere's no point getting a student from a poor background into university if\nyou won't support them to survive.\n\nBeware high-achieving students! Yet another blow to meritocracy and hard work\nby the red herring factory and their bleeding hearts.\n\nGrant Ross, Highton\n\n### Wine not?\n\nRECENTLY Prince Charles had his car converted to run on wine. Why has the Rudd\nGovernment overlooked a widespread introduction of this technology to\nAustralia? It could mitigate our petrol woes and tackle the serious issue of\nbinge drinking. Talk about killing two birds with the one stone!\n\nJake McLaughlan, Malvern\n\n### Out of date\n\nGERMAINE Greer (Comment & Debate, 17/7) largely misses the point of the Obama\ncandidacy. Her perspective on the US election is mired in the outdated\npolitics of the baby boom generation, where issues are framed in simplistic\nblack and white terms and political consensus-building is viewed as \"flip-\nflopping\". Camelot represents promise for the future, not comparisons to the\npast. A new generation of US voters, rejecting the alienating \"you're either\nwith us or against us\" world view, fuelled the Obama campaign's improbable\nvictory over Clinton's divisive baby boomer candidacy.\n\nGreer's take on racial and ethnic issues is equally outdated. With 46 million\nHispanics and growing percentages of mixed-race and multi-ethnic citizens, US\npolitics are simply no longer black and white. Obama not only literally\nembodies this change, his consensus-oriented approach to complex issues\nsprings forth from it. He, therefore, is indeed \"his own man\", he just does\nnot fit into Dr Greer's old-school categories.\n\nKevin Luten, Williamstown\n\n### Governor Greer?\n\nGREER is invariably not only thought-provoking and infuriating, but also\nentertaining. I think she should be allotted a spot on telly. America has\nJudge Judy \u0097 how about Gov Greer?\n\nBenjamin Martin, Prahran\n\n### Sad commentary\n\nISRAEL receives the coffins containing its two dead soldiers and despairs over\nthe loss of their lives; in exchange Hezbollah receives a terrorist convicted\nof grisly murders and the remains of other \"successful\" militants and rejoices\nin their valour. What a sad, pointed commentary on the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict.\n\nAlan Freedman, East St Kilda\n\n### Hitler ring any bells?\n\nNIGEL Wheeler (Letters, 17/7) believes Christianity has been a negative force\nin the world and quotes the example of the Crusades and the Inquisition. These\nwere indeed a corruption of the Christian message. Hopefully the church has\nrepented of this period of history and moved on. Should we wish to examine\ngenocide in contemporary times the secular humanists are a real standout. How\nabout Hitler, Pol Pot, or Stalin, just to scratch the surface of recent\nhistory?\n\nLance Sterling, Burwood\n\n", "url": "/politics/federal/earth-sacrificed-on-economic-altar-20080717-3gwh.html", "last_update": "2008-07-17T14:00:01Z", "source": "SMH"},
{"title": "Truth missing in game of to-and-fro", "article": "ONE of the fascinations of AFL footballers and sex-related items is how we,\nthe football-following public, continually make uninformed judgments based on\nwhich team we barrack for.\n\nThe media came down hard on Brendan Fevola, based on what turned out to be\nnothing.\n\nThe St Kilda footballers were adjudged guilty by non-St Kilda supporters,\nagain based on nothing. Likewise Collingwood footballers by Magpie haters. So\nwe get the situation where the Brisbane haters were hoping Fevola copped it,\nSt Kilda haters were calling those players rapists and Collingwood haters were\ndoing likewise.\n\nBut, and here's the twist, the St Kilda haters who barrack for Collingwood\nimmediately conclude their players are innocent, as is the case with the St\nKilda supporters and their players. The crux is which team you support, with\nthe media, as always, reporting in a sensational fashion designed to sell. In\nall cases we rarely, if ever, find out the facts.\n\n **Cliff Ellen, Rye**\n\n### Spin and the seven-year-old\n\nTHIS year I bought my seven-year-old grandson a Saints' jumper with Nick\nRiewoldt's number on the back. I also spent some time as a volunteer in his\ngrade one classroom helping him and his classmates with their reading and\nwriting.\n\nHe is making great progress with reading and he loves to practise his skills\nby reading the sports pages of the newspaper. ''Nude'', ''explicit'',\n''schoolgirl pregnancy'' were some of the newer words he encountered this\nweek.\n\nBut the most upsetting words, to my eyes, were spoken by the player-managers\nand club spin doctors, who whine about how ''sick and tired'' they are of\nthese constant invasions of their stars' privacy.\n\n **Brian Derum, North Fitzroy**\n\n### One rule for them \u2026\n\nONE hopes that none of the footballers involved in the lewd images fiasco had\nthe hypocrisy to forward images of Lara Bingle when they were doing the rounds\nof the football community.\n\nIn the same vein, I note _The Age_ has resisted the publication of the current\nimages, whereas I recall it was not so hesitant in the Bingle case.\n\n **Ross Tanner, Clifton Hill**\n\n### \u2026 And another for them\n\nWHAT a curious juxtaposition. Bank chief executive Ralph Norris declares his\ncharitable donations to be a private matter, whereas Saints captain Nick\nRiewoldt's privates, unfortunately, are anything but that at this point. Oh,\nfor a world where these situations could be reversed.\n\n **Howard Walter, Templestowe**\n\n### AFL's far-reaching power\n\nIT'S interesting that we have Julian Assange leaking potentially dangerous\ninformation to the world and no legal action can be taken to stop him. It's\ninteresting that a 17-year-old girl has placed photos of AFL players on\nFacebook and she is served with a court order to stop her. Could it be that\nthe AFL is more powerful than America?\n\n **Diane Parker, Warrnambool**\n\n###\n\n### Brumby wins while we, the voters, lose\n\nTHE clique that controls the ALP in Victoria must ensure that the party is\nnever again held hostage by a leader like John Brumby. He was bound to be a\nwinner whichever way the election went. Victory would have allowed him to\ncontinue his ego-driven style as premier; and defeat will mean a pension,\nperks and probably a high-level appointment.\n\nState MPs and senior party figures have appeared happy to give the leader an\nunwarranted degree of autonomy. This allowed Mr Brumby to position the ALP to\nthe right of the Liberal Party on key issues, such rejection of an independent\ncommission against corruption.\n\nMr Brumby also ridiculed Labor's traditional social democratic values, thus\neliminating any ideological distance between the major parties, making it all\ntoo easy for liberal-minded voters to switch sides.\n\nThis should never have been permitted. Some deed of understanding, at least at\nan informal level, between leader and MPs must be instituted so that\naccountability arrives long before election day.\n\nIn all probability, November's loss will mean a long period in opposition for\nthe ALP and hardship for working-class supporters; Mr Brumby, however,\narchitect of the debacle, will be living the high life, with state politics\njust a distant memory.\n\n **Philip Cassell, Malvern East**\n\n### Labor must learn\n\nI WONDER which developer will be the first to offer John Brumby a job after\nhis loyalty in transforming Melbourne into one of the most overdeveloped,\noverpopulated, over-taxed and over-priced cities in the world.\n\nHe has left many with the sour taste of declining living standards and quality\nof life, while rewarding his business mates. Daniel Andrews and Julia Gillard\nclaim to have working-class roots, yet there is no acknowledgement from them\nof what Melbourne has become.\n\nLabor, state and federally, should take heed of Kelvin Thomson's recent\ncomments. It seems he is the only Labor politician in touch with reality, and\nrepresenting Labor's true values. Labor will stay in the wilderness and\ncontinue to bleed votes if the Brumby legacy is perpetuated.\n\n **Tony Smith, Burwood**\n\n### Victims must be first\n\nVICTIMS' rights were ignored yesterday when Justice Katharine Williams sent\nfamily members to the upper level of the court and allowed only a guilty man's\nfamily in the lower level to hear his sentencing. (''Man smirks after being\njailed for running down love rival'', theage.com.au, 22/12).\n\nJustice Williams claimed she was worried about conflict, but this doesn't\nwash. If this was the case, then the rights of the victim's family should have\nbeen paramount. We need an urgent overhaul of the so-called justice system,\nand we need it now.\n\n **Kersten Gentle, Coalition for Safer Communities, Healesville**\n\n### Judges and juries\n\nTRIAL judges were responsible for two-thirds of retrials of child sex assault\ncases in Victoria this year (''Judges' miscarriage of justice'', _The Age_ ,\n18/12). This isn't surprising when more than half of child sex assault\nconvictions are appealed, and about half of these are successful.\n\nDirections to a jury in a child sex assault trial are multiple, lengthy and\ncomplex. This is because of the secretive and uncorroborated nature of these\nincidents and the delay in reporting. Judicial error in instructing juries in\nsuch cases, represents more than half of all grounds for appeal.\n\nThe other contributor could be the Court of Appeal itself. With jury\ndirections, the court can be fervid in its demands on the trial judge.\n\nAlso, there is a recent and growing willingness for appellate courts to\ninterfere with jury directions that were not raised, or objected to, by\ncounsel during the trial. This may be undermining the trial judge.\n\nAppeal court outcomes carry weight and influence future judicial decisions. Is\nthe Court of Appeal, in judging the judges, also contributing to a high rate\nof appeals of child sex assault convictions?\n\n **Judy Courtin, Brunswick**\n\n### The heat on greens\n\nTHE axing of the Green Loans and Green Start schemes ( _The Age_ , 22/12)\nsuggests that Climate Change Minister Greg Combet is taking his portfolio\nseriously, getting good advice and acting on it. But he has a tough job on his\nhands convincing a public subjected to a decade of propaganda on how their own\nimproved personal energy efficiency can save the planet.\n\nThe fact is that the avenues for reducing national energy consumption without\nseriously damaging prosperity are limited. As for households, direct energy\nconsumption is only about 16 per cent of Australia's total primary energy use.\nEnergy embedded in the goods and services we buy accounts for the vast bulk of\nour personal energy use. More efficient usage is elusive and tracking where\nthe energy goes is even harder. As with Watergate, the best advice is ''follow\nthe money''; if it costs more, then it probably uses more energy somewhere.\n\nGreen groups have consistently fostered unreasonable expectations of improved\nenergy efficiency. One of Mr Combet's many challenges is to hose them down.\n\n **Tom Biegler, St Kilda East**\n\n### Let's aim for zero\n\nTHE decline in Australia's population growth rate from 2.2 to 1.7 per cent is\nmost welcome (''Growth rate lowest since 2007'', _The Age_ , 22/12).\n\nNevertheless, if this growth rate is maintained, Australia's population will\ndouble in 41 years, that is, from 22.3 million to 44.6 million by 2051. This\nis not something to look forward to, especially with the uncertainties thrust\non us by climate change and rising fuel prices.\n\nLet us hope the growth rate steadily declines until it reaches zero. It will\nmean less intrusion on other species' habitats, less demand on our water and\nenergy supplies, and give us a chance to have infrastructure catch up with\nprevious population growth.\n\n **Jenny Goldie, Sustainable Population Australia member, Michelago, NSW**\n\n### Fibre-rich future\n\nTHE new national broadband network is not only all about web-surfing and\nonline video (Letters, 22/12). It's about upgrading our national\ncommunications network.\n\nChanges to fibre optic cables are needed to help keep up with the rest of the\nworld. One optic fibre can carry an additional 1900-plus phone calls at once,\nreducing immensely the amount of total cables required.\n\nTelephone numbers and equipment will stay the same as the only thing being\nreplaced is a wire, not the entire system.\n\nThe sooner this system is implemented, the sooner communication prices will\nreduce, as the amount of bandwidth available will increase 10-fold.\n\n **Brayden Smith-Morvell, Kyabram**\n\n### Multicultural school\n\nLET'S get real about refugee movement around the world.\n\nThere were kids from about 40 different countries in my small primary school\nin the '80s.\n\nThose ''stop the boats'' people are ignoring the truth. We have always had\npeople arriving here in desperate circumstances. Afif fled Iraq, Fadi fled\nSyria, Nga Bich fled Vietnam - these are real people. They were my schoolmates\nand friends.\n\nI'm much happier that I sat next to them in school, rather than Tony Abbott,\nTed Baillieu or Andrew Bolt.\n\n **Cindy O'Connor, Brunswick**\n\n### Online shopping has home-grown winners\n\nTHE issue with online retailing is not the reduction of profits in Australia-\nwide commerce but about the new distribution of increasing profits: the\nconsumer cake is getting bigger.\n\nWhile bricks-and-mortar retailers might be losers in this new online retail\nlandscape, local logistics outfits, Australian airplane and airport operators,\nand internet service providers are winners. The banks are winners too, as they\ntake a credit card currency conversion fee, as well as a foreign exchange\nmargin, on each transaction, together with merchant fees.\n\nOf course, increased demand stimulated by lower prices, wider range, immediate\navailability, and fast, accurate and courteous service will eventually return\nbigger profits to Australia's extractive industries also.\n\nIn mass retail, volume is everything. My message to Gerry Harvey et al is:\n''why do you seem to want to hold Australia back?''\n\n **Stephen Fox, Arncliffe, NSW**\n\n### Costello missteps\n\nPETER Costello has a nerve and/or a short memory when he accuses Julia Gillard\nof cheapening her office by appearing on the Oprah show (Comment, 22/12).\n\nThis from a former treasurer and would-be-prime minister-but-didn't-have-the-\nticker who embarrassed us all with his silly dancing on the Kerri-Anne\nKennerley show. Catch it again on YouTube and weep.\n\n **Paul Abbott, Port Melbourne**\n\n### And another thing...\n\nDETAILS of the flawed investigations and accusations on the Assange rape case\nhave been leaked to a Swedish newspaper. Oh, the irony.\n\n **George Fernandez, Eltham North**\n\n###  **Mohamed Haneef**\n\nWHY should the taxpayer have to cop the cost of compensation for the\nCoalition's dirty games against Mohamed Haneef? Take it all out of the salary\nand superannuation of Kevin Andrews and John Howard.\n\n **Roger Hehir, Malvern East**\n\nIN THE matter of Dr Haneef, Kevin Andrews displays the Olympian arrogance that\nwas the hallmark of the Howard government.\n\n **Colin Jones, South Melbourne**\n\nNOW that Dr Haneef has received a ''substantial'' payout after being wrongly\naccused of an international terror plot, it is to be hoped he will use his\nconsiderable medical skills in India, where they are desperately needed,\nrather than return to Australia, where the need is not so great.\n\n **Dr Graham Schmidt, Box Hill**\n\n###  **John Brumby**\n\nTHE resignation of John Brumby is welcome to opponents of the grand prix in\nAlbert Park, as he was against it when in opposition and hypocritically\nextended its term when premier, despite escalating losses and widespread\nopposition.\n\n **Reg Boyd, St Kilda**\n\nAS JOHN Brumby's retirement also raises his pay rate from backbencher to ex-\npremier, maybe he can foot the bill for the byelection.\n\n **Hans Paas, Castlemaine**\n\nJOHN Brumby's resignation illustrates that politicians can't be trusted, and\nhave no compunction about wasting taxpayers' money.\n\n **Lance Cranage, Mount Waverley**\n\nTHERE does not have to be a byelection in Broadmeadows. In fact, an MP's\nresignation need never cause a byelection. Just offer the seat, the prize, to\nthe person who came second.\n\n **Colin Fox, Romsey**\n\n###  **Furthermore**\n\nCOME on Peter Costello, you are just disappointed Oprah didn't invite you to\ndo the macarena.\n\n **Lesley Hollands, Warragu** **l**\n\nHUNDREDS of arrests for public drunkenness (theage.com.au, 19/12) but not one\nreport of a licensed venue being cautioned or fined for breaching responsible\nservice of alcohol guidelines. Is someone serving these drunks or are they\nspontaneously arriving at this state of extreme intoxication?\n\n **James Martin, Northcote**\n\nTHE odds of finding cheap fuel for the weekend are about the same as for it\nraining pennies from heaven.\n\n **John Dorman, Carnegie**\n\nCONGRATULATIONS and merry Christmas to all at the weather bureau. Their\nforecasts over recent months have been - in this region, anyway - reliable and\naccurate. Would that the same could be said of the trains.\n\n **Jim Dickson, Mount Eliza**\n\nWHY are retailers concerned about December sales?

{"title": "Spring to it: Our critics pick the best events of the season", "article": "### As the weather heats up, there are plenty of cool shows, exhibitions and\nfilms to look out for.\n\n### Visual art\n\n **by John McDonald**\n\n ** _Paper Tigers_ , ****National Art School Gallery, until October 12**\n\nIn conjunction with Sedition, a festival of art, music and pictures, the NAS\ngallery is showing poster art from an especially active period in Sydney, from\nthe 1960s-80s. In those days before social media, posters played an important\nrole in alerting people about protest rallies and rock concerts \u2013 the two not\nbeing mutually exclusive. Groups such as the Tin Sheds Art Workshop or Redback\nGraphix were responsible for some of the most vibrant, spikey street art ever\nseen in this city. Over time these ephemeral creations have become important\nhistorical documents, and inevitably, collectors' items.\n\n _ **Making Art Public:**_ ** _50 Years of Kaldor Public Art Projects_ ,\n****Art Gallery of NSW, September 7 - February 16**\n\nIt's been a mere 10 years since the Art Gallery of NSW hosted a huge survey of\nthe Kaldor Public Art Projects, but it's all happening again in celebration of\nthe 50th anniversary of this remarkable enterprise. This time John Kaldor has\nasked British artist Michael Landy to come up with an original display\nconcept, making the entire exhibition into a large-scale artwork. The\nnarrative, however, will remain the same, starting with Christo and Jeanne-\nClaude's wrapping of Little Bay in 1969 and ending with Asad Raza's soil\nproject, _Absorption_ , held in May this year. There have been 35 Projects so\nfar and it's no exaggeration to say they have changed the way we view art in\nthis country.\n\n ** _THEN_ , ****White Rabbit Gallery, September 11 \u2013 December 31**\n\nWhite Rabbit Gallery is 10-years old and celebrating with an exhibition that\nincludes some favourite works and new acquisitions. If that sounds like every\nother show at this venue, who's complaining? Judith Neilson's privately funded\ngallery of contemporary Chinese art is one of Sydney's unique attractions,\nfeaturing work of consummate intelligence and ambition. For the past two\ndecades the Chinese have been at the forefront of the international art scene\nand many of the most iconic pieces have made their way into the White Rabbit\ncollection. The show will include memorable works by artists such as Qi\nZhilong, Xu Zhen, Bingyi and Bu Hua.\n\n **Sydney Contemporary,** **Carriageworks, September 12 \u2013 15**\n\nThis city loves an event, and the Sydney Contemporary art fair has surged in\npopularity from one year to the next. The fifth edition is expected to be the\nbiggest yet, featuring more than 80 galleries from Australia and around the\nworld. There will be talks, performances, special installations and huge\ncrowds \u2013 so don't even think about parking. Dedicated collectors get in early\nto make their purchases, but there will be plenty left over for those just\ndipping a toe into the water. The art fair model has become incredibly popular\nin a time-poor world. In the space of a day it allows viewers to see more art\nthan they would during an entire year of gallery-going.\n\n _ **River on the Brink:**_ ** _Inside the Murray-Darling Basin_ , ****S.H.\nErvin Gallery, September 20 - November 3**\n\nYears of mismanagement and inaction have created an environmental crisis in\nthe Murray-Darling Basin. This exhibition brings together more than 20\nartists, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to respond to an ongoing disaster\nthat successive governments have failed to address. An old-fashioned exercise\nin consciousness-raising, the show aims to dramatise the issue in a more vivid\nway than the news reports. Let's hope Angus Taylor and Barnaby Joyce pop in\nfor a look. The list of artists includes Ben Quilty, Elisabeth Cummings, Euan\nMacleod, Guy Maestri, Idris Murphy, Julie Harris, Luke Sciberras and others\nwho have shown more long-term commitment to Australian landscape than the\npoliticians.\n\n ** _Tarnanthi_ , ****Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide, October 18 -\nJanuary 27**\n\nYou'll have to travel for this one, but if the third Tarnanthi festival of\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art is as good as its two predecessors,\nit'll be well worth a trip to Adelaide. As a showcase of the ongoing vitality\nof Indigenous art, Tarnanthi has rapidly established itself as one of the\ncountry's most dynamic exhibitions. This year promises to feature more than\n1000 artists (yes, that's what the press release says!) from across the\ncontinent, with a special focus on Yirrkala in Arnhem Land, where figures such\nas Gunybi Ganambarr and Nonggirrna Marawili have become established stars.\n\n ** _Japan Supernatural_ , ****Art Gallery of NSW, November 2 \u2013 March 8**\n\nThis show will be based around a monumental work by Takashi Murakami \u2013 Japan's\nanswer to Andy Warhol (he even has a studio called The Factory). Alongside\nMurakami's large-scale painting and sculpture installation, the gallery will\nbe showing Ukiyo-e prints by masters such as Hokusai, Kuniyoshi and\nYoshitoshi; and works by acclaimed contemporary artists such as Miwa Yanagi.\nThe theme is 'the supernatural' \u2013 the demons and ghosts that have haunted the\nJapanese imagination from the Middle Ages to the present day. More than 200\nworks are scheduled to be shown, and there'll be no excuses if there isn't a\ngood movie program!\n\n### Classical music and opera\n\n **by Harriet Cunningham**\n\n ** _Il Viaggio a Reims_ , Joan Sutherland Theatre, Sydney Opera House,\nOctober 24-November 2**\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of Rossini\u2019s _Il Viaggio a Reims_. He wrote it for\nthe coronation of Charles X of France in 1825, then immediately withdrew the\nscore. Which makes this production with the Dutch National Opera and the Royal\nDanish Theatre all the more tantalising. With a big budget, big cast, big\nvoices, and a tongue firmly in cheek, this operatic cast-off promises to\nemerge from two centuries of neglect, transformed. Hopefully it will be a\nbutterfly, not a moth.\n\n ** _Next Generation Baroque_ , Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, City Recital\nHall, September 11-20**\n\nIt's strange to think that when the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra exploded\nonto the stage of the Sydney Opera House for the first time back in 1989,\nbaroque violinist Annie Gard, soprano Madison Nonoa and violinist Christian Li\nweren't even born. Now, in 2019, as the orchestra celebrates its thirtieth\nanniversary year, these three exceptional young musicians take them into the\nfuture, performing Handel, Bach and Vivaldi. In particular, listen out for\nChristian Li who, at just 11, has already won a slew of prizes, including\nJunior First Prize at the Yehudi Menuhin Competition in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n **Bruckner's _Symphony No. 7_ , Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Concert Hall,\nSydney Opera House, October 17-19**\n\nFrom the refinement of Mozart and the clarity of Bach to the blazing, visceral\nsounds of Anton Bruckner. It's time to turn up the volume and experience the\nfull-blown rose of romanticism as Scottish maestro Donald Runnicles leads the\nSydney Symphony Orchestra through Bruckner's Symphony No. 7. This work calls\nfor a huge orchestra, including four Wagner tubas, the curious lovechildren of\na French horn and a trombone. The legendary Runnicles, who is renowned for his\npassionate interpretations of the music of Wagner, Strauss and Bruckner among\nothers, makes his debut as newly appointed principal guest conductor of Sydney\nSymphony Orchestra.\n\n ** _The Bach Project_ , Yo Yo Ma, Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House, November\n4**\n\nA man. A cello. A big idea. American-Chinese musician Yo Yo Ma has introduced\naudiences across the world to the haunting beauty of Bach's six suites for\nsolo cello. Now he is using the power of this music to explore how culture can\nmake us stronger as individuals, as communities, as a planet. His odyssey has\ntaken him to iconic sites around the world including Lima, Mumbai and, now,\nSydney, as he presents the Bach cello suites alongside a day of meaningful\nconversations on subjects ranging from music and literature to science and the\nenvironment. His heartfelt message is that culture connects us. Yes.\n\n ** _Nosferatu_ , Ensemble Offspring, Chauvel Cinema, November 22**\n\nYou've seen Twilight, you've seen Buffy. Now see _Nosferatu._ This 1920s movie\nis where it all started for vampires on screen. Loosely based on Bram Stoker's\nnovel _Dracula,_ this silent horror pic has become a cult classic. Now Perth\ncomposer Chris Tonkin has put together a new soundtrack to be performed, live,\nalongside a screening. Four intrepid musicians from Ensemble Offspring will\ncapture all chilling atmosphere, the spooky stares and suspenseful moments in\nthis the world premiere performance. What fun.\n\n ** _Counterpoints: Steve Reich_ , Sydney Art Quartet, Emanuel Synagogue,\nNovember 27-28**\n\nWhat if? Two words which have inspired many an art work. Including Steve\nReich's _Different Trains,_ which takes his childhood memories of long train\njourneys shuttling back and forth between parents on opposite sides of the\nNorth American continent during the Second World War and considers what might\nhave happened had this young Jewish boy been on a train in Europe at the same\ntime. _Different Trains_ makes use of interviews with Holocaust survivors and\ncontemporary Americans, forming \"speech melody\" spliced in with live sound. It\nis performed by the Sydney Art Quartet, a virtuoso string quartet that has,\nsince 2015, been getting on with doing things differently.\n\n### Theatre\n\n **by Joyce Morgan**\n\n ** _Splinter_ , ****Griffin Theatre,** **September 11-October 12**\n\nA missing child, terrified parents and an unsettling reunion. When the child\nreturns home the parents' nightmare truly begins. Hilary Bell's play considers\nsome of our primal fears. In doing so Bell revisits the dark terrain of her\nseminal play _Wolf Lullaby,_ which dealt with the murder of one child by\nanother. That haunting play, which featured her sister Lucy Bell, ingered in\nthis critic's mind long after its 1996 Griffin premiere. _Splinter,_ too,\nfeatures Lucy Bell as a mother forced to confront the unthinkable in a\nproduction directed by Lee Lewis. With video by tech whiz Mic Gruchy.\n\n ** _Hair_ , Concert Hall, ****Sydney Opera House,** **October 3-6**\n\nGet out the flares and crushed velvet. The tribal love rock musical is back.\nSydney went crazy when _Hair_ got its rocks and gear off at the height of the\nanti-Vietnam era. Vice squads were called, obscenity charges threatened and a\nbomb scare cleared the theatre. It felt daring just being in the audience.\nThere's a heady whiff of nostalgia about a 50th anniversary production. In\n1969, full-frontal nudity \u2013 the first on an Australian stage - and songs like\n_Hashish_ and _Sodomy_ pushed the boundaries. Now the anthemic _Age of\nAquarius_ and _Let the Sunshine_ have entered the songbooks. Paulini and Hugh\nSheridan star and Declan Greene ( _Blackie Blackie Brown_ ) directs the\nmusical for a new generation.\n\n ** _Cosi_ , Sydney Theatre Company, ****Drama Theatre, Sydney Opera House,**\n**November 5-December 14**\n\nThe lunatics have taken over the asylum. Outside its walls, the other lunatics\nare ramping up the Vietnam War. Louis Nowra's 1992 _Cosi_ has had many\nproductions and even been turned into a movie. But this is the first time the\nSTC has staged his classic tragi-comedy. Set within a psychiatric institution,\nan inmate has a bright idea: let's perform a Mozart opera. No one can sing. No\none understands Italian. No worries. So the patients learn their lines and\noccasionally forget their meds. It'll be fine on the night. Set against the\nbackdrop of Vietnam War protests, it stars the marvellous Robert Menzies as\nRoy, the manic depressive with a passion for theatre. Sarah Goodes directs a\nlarge cast that also includes Glenn Hazeldine, Bessie Holland and Rahel\nRomahn.\n\n ** _Packer and Sons,_ ****Belvoir Theatre,** **November 20-December 22**\n\nGamblers, media barons and power players. The Packer dynasty has loomed large\nover Sydney for almost a century. Intensely private, the family have\nnonetheless rarely been out of the headlines. The play traces four generations\nof the tough, combative men who have built a global empire. Focusing on the\ntransition of generational power, it considers what is passed from father to\nson. What does power do to those who pull its levers? What is the price of\nbecoming a master of the universe? They are among the questions playwright\nTommy Murphy ( _Holding the Man, Mark Colvin's Kidney_ ) asks. Starring John\nGaden and John Howard.\n\n ** _The Beauty Queen of Leenane_ , Sydney Theatre Company, Roslyn Packer\nTheatre,** **November 22-December 21**\n\nMaureen is a lonely spinster who lives with her domineering, ageing mother\nMag. Porridge and psychic poison are essential ingredients in the shabby home\nin dank, rural Leenane. When charmer Pato Dooley returns to their Irish\nvillage he could be just the ticket out of tedium and tyranny for Maureen.\nMartin McDonagh's 1996 play was the first of his _Leenane_ trilogy and won a\nslew of awards. And it helped launch the writer best known for the movies _In\nBruges_ and _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri._ With its mix of\nmundanity, melancholy and murderous rage, the play centred on a pair of\ngrotesques is brutal, black and wickedly funny. Paige Rattray directs.\n\n###  **Contemporary music  \n**\n\n **by George Palathingal**\n\n **Troye Sivan, Horden Pavilion, September 20-21\u202c  \n**\n\nNo Australian* musician in recent memory has had a rise to superstardom quite\nlike 24-year-old Perth pop titan Troye Sivan. Having started out as a popular\nwannabe on YouTube half his lifetime ago, he has patiently made the transition\nto credible recording artist. Last year's mature yet still playful _Bloom_\nalbum cemented that status, showing that his striking, much-celebrated debut\n_Blue Neighbourhood_ was no fluke. He has also improved proportionally as an\nengaging and confident live performer since.\n\n*We know he was born in South Africa and that he now lives in Los Angeles but he'll always be ours, OK?\n\n **Angie McMahon, City Recital Hall, \u202aOctober 4**\n\nLike Sivan, Melbourne singer-songwriter Angie McMahon has expertly played the\nlong game on her path to success. She finally released her debut album _Salt_\nin July, on which if her electric-guitar-driven songs didn't get you, her\nsublime vocals surely did. Given those songs often come in gorgeous, sparse\narrangements, the City Recital Hall, with its superb acoustics, might be the\nperfect place to see her perform. Oh, and if you need instant proof of her\nconsiderable talent, look up her cover of Neil Young's _Helpless_ online and\nmake sure you're sitting down when you listen to it.\n\n **Hans Zimmer, Qudos Bank Arena\u202a, October 5\u202c**\n\nSexagenarian composers of film scores don't often qualify as rock stars but\nGerman veteran Hans Zimmer has lately carved a niche as an unmissable\nperformer with his dazzling live show. You only have to think of some of his\nmany, stunning works to see why: in 2013's _Man of Steel_ it was his music\nthat made Superman truly soar; he crushed the mountainous challenge of writing\nnew _Blade Runner_ music for its 2017 sequel; and this year he again ruled the\nAmerican-summer box office by revisiting his Oscar-winning score for the live-\naction remake of 1995's _The Lion King_.\n\n **Seeker Lover Keeper, Factory Theatre, \u202aOctober 17\u202c**\n\n ****That three successful Australian singer-songwriters could find time to\nget together for one special album - Seeker Lover Keeper's eponymous 2011\ncollection of gorgeous, indie-ish pop - seemed unlikely. That Sarah Blasko,\nSally Seltmann and Holly Throsby have reunited for a follow-up, albeit after\nan understandable eight-year gap, then, is truly something to be cherished. It\nshouldn't have come as a surprise, as it happens; that first album remains\neach artist's highest-charting effort and proved that supergroups can be more\nthan the sum of its parts. Having three terrific singers and musicians\nperforming in exquisite harmony certainly helps, though.\n\n **U2, Sydney Cricket Ground, \u202aNovember 22-23**\n\nOnly a band as huge as U2 - and, admittedly, an album as spectacular as 1987's\nstadium-rock classic _The Joshua Tree_ \\- could get away with continuing an\nanniversary celebration two years (and a separate album tour) after it turned\n20. While most of _The Joshua Tree_ has provided unforgettable highlights on\nmost U2 tours ( _Where the Streets Have No Name_ , _With or Without You_ and\n_Bullet the Blue Sky_ , to name just three), it'll be a joy to hear the less\nplayed likes of _Red Hill Mining Town_ and _Trip Through Your Wires_ \\- not to\nmention enormous tunes from the rest of the Irishmen's career - too.\n\n **Festival X, Sydney Showground, November 30**\n\nDance parties have found themselves under a drug-related cloud as long as most\nof us can remember, but if organisers and patrons act responsibly there's no\nreason to suggest they should be banned altogether. The inaugural Festival X\nhas built a strong case for its existence with its line-up, having secured the\nbiggest name in modern dance music, Brit superstar DJ Calvin Harris, as its\nheadliner, with strong support from a host of artists including American indie\nrapper Lil Pump and a couple of inspirational Sydneysiders in producer\nextraordinaire Alison Wonderland and soulful singer Thandi Phoenix.\n\n###  **Dance**\n\n **by Valerie Lawson**\n\n ** _Us 50_ and _6 Breaths_ , Sydney Dance Company, Roslyn Packer Theatre,\nNovember 2-9**\n\nTo celebrate Sydney Dance Company's 50th anniversary, Gideon Obarzenek has\nchoreographed a new work, _Us 50_ , in which dancers past and present will be\njoined each night by more than 20 audience participants who, he says,\n\"represent the keepers of the company's history\". No need to fear you will be\nrandomly chosen as the audience members will be volunteers, with new\nperformers every night. Your chance to get on the stage, perform alongside\ncompany dancers and 10 alumni dancers and be directed live on stage by\nObarzenek. The company's looking for people of all ages (14+) of \"all shapes\nand sizes. No performance or dance experience is necessary\". The anniversary\nproduction also includes _6 Breaths_ , choreographed by company artistic\ndirector Rafael Bonachela.\n\n ** _Sylvia_ , Australian Ballet, Joan Sutherland Theatre, Sydney Opera House,\nNovember 8-23**\n\nLeo Delibes' score for the ballet _Sylvia_ , first staged in Paris in 1886,\ninspired many 20th century choreographers, among them Frederick Ashton, George\nBalanchine, John Neumeier and Mark Morris. But the complicated narrative of\nSylvia, a huntress nymph and other mythological creatures, was seldom staged\neven though Ashton made the story simple when he explained: \"Boy loves girl,\ngirl captured by bad man, girl restored to boy by God.\" Now Stanton Welch, the\nAustralian-born choreographer and artistic director of Houston Ballet, has\nreinvented the ballet in a co-production with the Australian Ballet and with\ndesigns by the Frenchman, Jerome Kaplan. Expect sword fighting goddesses on\nstage, sculptural body armour, bows and arrows and a team of mischievous\nfauns.\n\n ** _Chicago_ , Capitol Theatre, until October 13**\n\nIf you've watched the new TV show, Fosse/Verdon, you'll know a lot about the\nlife of Bob Fosse and his wife, the dancer, Gwen Verdon. The show is focused\nmore on family drama than the Fosse's choreography. To find more about his\nunique dance style watch _Chicago_ , one of his best musicals. It's coming\nback to Sydney with all its wit, vaudevillian moves, shoulder shrugs, jazz\nhands, suggestive forward hip-thrusts, shuffling feet, white gloves and\nfishnet tights.\n\n **Australian Ballet School Showcase, The Concourse, September 27 & 28**\n\nBased in Melbourne, the Australian Ballet School dancers don't often perform\nin Sydney but this year they will as they bring a showcase of works performed\nby the school's full-time students and choreographed by resident\nchoreographers, guest teacher Leigh Rowles, former Australian Ballet dancer,\nRichard House and George Balanchine's ballet, _Who Cares?_ danced to songs by\nGeorge Gershwin. Not all the students get chosen by the Australian Ballet\nafter graduation, but they will continue to find a way to professional\ncompanies throughout the world. The showcase is an important stepping-stone\nfrom school to a job and they deserve applause, not only from their families\nbut those who know how hard it is to become a professional ballet dancer.\n\n **Billy Elliott, Lyric Theatre, October 10 - December 8**\n\nAfter the success of the _Billy Elliott_ movie and stage musical almost every\nyoung male ballet dancer was described as the new Billy. Of course that didn't\nhappen, but the show was a trigger for so many new boys to take the challenge\nand not feel like they might be mocked or embarrassed. _Billy Elliot the\nMusical_ is returning to Australia this year for its 10th anniversary tour\nand, again, talented kids will be chosen for the titular role if they are\nabout 12 years old, can sing, act, and tumble and know how to perform three\ndance styles - ballet, jazz, and tap. No pressure then except for the families\nas they wait for the results of the auditions. Billy Elliott is a much-loved\nmusical not only for the dancing, but for its humour and inspirational\nnarrative.\n\n **Cinderella, Queensland Ballet, Canberra Theatre Centre, November 5-10**\n\nCanberra audiences miss out when they don't get to see performances from major\nballet companies, but next November the Queensland Ballet is bringing\n_Cinderella_ to the capital. Choreographed by Ben Stevenson, _Cinderella_ was\nthe first full evening ballet programmed by Li Cunxin in his first year as\nartistic director of Queensland Ballet. As the new director, Li needed a sure-\nfire box office success. He chose wisely, with this fairy tale production\ndanced to a sumptuous score, with dresses splashed with crystals, a comedy duo\nand a happily-ever-after ending.\n\n### Film\n\n **by Garry Maddox**\n\n ** _Blinded by the Light,_ from October 24**\n\nA warm-hearted comic drama from British director Gurinder Chadha, best known\nfor _Bend It Like Beckham_ , that is arguably this year's most joyously\nentertaining film. In an adaptation of a memoir by writer and devoted Bruce\nSpringsteen fan Sarfraz Manzoor, Luton teenager Javed (Viveik Kalra) is\nstruggling to find where he fits in Thatcherist Britain, with his father\n(Kulvinder Ghir) losing his job in a car factory, his mother (Meera Ganatra)\nhaving to take on more sewing work at home and the National Front attacking\n\"Pakis\". But his life changes when a Sikh schoolfriend (Aaron Phagura)\nintroduces him to the Boss's songs and he gets the courage to ask out a\nrebellious fellow student (Nell Williams).\n\n **Sydney Latin American Film Festival, Dendy Opera Quays, September 4 to 11;\nAddison Road Picture House, Marrickville, September 10; Casula Powerhouse,\nSeptember 21**\n\nFilm festivals seem to flourish over spring in Sydney. And given the strength\nof Latin American cinema - headed by the Mexico's Oscar-winning trio of\nAlfonso Cuaron, Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro Inarritu - this is one of the\nstand-outs. This year, the festival has films from Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia,\nColombia, Cuba, Chile, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and\nVenezuela. The opening night fiesta kicks off with Marilia Hughes and Claudio\nMarques _The Cotton Wool War_ , a coming-of-age drama about a teenage girl\nwho, on being sent to what she thinks is just a holiday to Brazil, discovers\nthe secrets behind her enigmatic grandmother's life.\n\n ** _Ride Like a Girl_ , from September 26**\n\nJust over a year ago, Rachel Griffiths was downcast before a cinema Q&A;\nscreening of the TV series _Dead Lucky_. She'd just watched the first rough\nassembly after shooting _Ride Like a Girl_ , her debut feature film as\ndirector. It took a fellow director to remind her that everyone feels\ndepressed watching the first long, raw and inevitably messy version of their\nfilm. By now, what shapes as a warm-hearted drama about Michelle Payne\nbecoming the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup should be humming.\nTeresa Palmer stars as Payne, with Sam Neill playing her father Paddy and\nbrother Stevie as himself.\n\n ** _Joker_ , from October 3**\n\nSurely we've had enough _Batman_ movies. Surely after Heath Ledger's masterful\nperformance in _The Dark Knight_ , there's no need for a new take on the\nJoker. And yet, and yet, and yet ... there's something genuinely intriguing\nabout Joaquin Phoenix taking on the role in what the trailer suggests is\ntragi-comic psychological drama. It's an origin story about how a failed\ncomedian turns to criminal mayhem that also stars Robert De Niro as a talk\nshow host. But the jury is out given it's written and directed by Todd\nPhillips, whose variable output of bro movies includes _Old School, Starsky &\nHutch, The Hangover trilogy_ and _War Dogs_.\n\n **Greek Film Festival, Palace Norton Street, October 8-20**\n\nWith _The Lobster_ and _The Favourite_ , director Yorgos Lanthimos has been\nattracting all sorts of raves for Greek cinema. Given his father, Antonis, was\na professional basketball player who played for the national team, it's\nfitting this year's Greek Film Festival opens with an inspirational drama\nabout that very sport. Tassos Boulmetis' _1968_ is about the nation's first\nwin in the European Cup against a seemingly unbeatable Czech team at an\nhistoric time of post-war rivalry between European nations, the assassination\nof Martin Luther King and the Vietnam War.\n\n ** _Where'd You Go, Bernadette_ , from October 24**\n\nA year on, The New York Times' bestseller list is no guarantee of a good\nmovie. But the regularly brilliant Richard Linklater ( _Boyhood, Before\nSunrise/Sunset/Midnight_ ) directs a cast headed by Cate Blanchett, Billy\nCrudup and Kristen Wiig in this adaptation of Maria Semple's comic novel, so\nthe signs are encouraging. Our Cate plays an agoraphobic architect who goes\nmissing before a planned trip, with Emma Nelson as the teenage daughter who is\non a mission to find out where she has gone. Also missing, although we will\ntry to overlook it, is the question mark at the end of the title.\n\n ** _Emu Runner,_ from November 7**\n\nGetting a cinema release after a series of well-received festival screenings,\nwriter-director Imogen Thomas' debut film centres on a spirited nine-year-old\nAboriginal girl (newcomer Rhae-Kye Waites) who, while grieving her mother's\nsudden death, forms a bond with a wild emu. Thomas made _Emu Runner_ in\ncollaboration with the Indigenous community of Brewarrina. Among a largely\nnon-professional cast, Wayne Blair plays her father, Georgia Blizzard is a\nconcerned social worker and Rob Carlton is a local cop. Variety called it \"a\nserene and finely detailed coming-of-age tale\" that is \"a deep, rich\nmeditation on family, community, country and racial tensions\".\n\n### Jazz/World/Cabaret\n\n **by John Shand**\n\n ** _An intimate evening with Paul Capsis_ , Ensemble Theatre, September\n8-16**\n\nBlessed with a singing voice that could have blasted open a career in which\ntheatre played no part, Paul Capsis chose to tread the boards as well, and\nmade himself into a formidable actor. Now he looks back on how it has all\npanned out in a show of stories and songs. With just piano accompaniment\n(Jeremy Brennan), he applies his chameleon voice to investigating the work of\nthe likes of Amy Winehouse, Tom Waits, Patti Smith, Nina Simone and even\nWilliam Burroughs, plus old friends of previous Capsis shows such as Janis\nJoplin and Judy Garland.\n\n ** _Monsieur Camembert's Leonard Cohen Show_ , City Recital Hall, September\n21**\n\nGathered together, the songs, poetry and musings of Leonard Cohen became less\na concert and more a diary of what it means to be human, telling of our lusts,\nsorrows, joys, betrayals and munificence \u2013 minus our pettiness and mundanity.\nLed by Yaron Hallis, the inimitable Monsieur Camembert makes an annual\npilgrimage to the shrine of one of the greatest songwriters and, with the help\nof guests such as jazz singer Greg Arthur, it simultaneously casts Cohen's\nwork in a fresh light and exposes its deepest truths. Cohen fans who have\nnever witnessed this ever-evolving show are missing something magical.\n\n **Elysian Fields, Foundry 616, October 10**\n\nHere is a sound so disorienting it's like dreaming someone else's dreams. The\nviola da gamba is a stringed instrument usually associated with Renaissance\nmusic. Jenny Eriksson solid-body electric model magnifies the glorious\ninstrument's dynamic range, to allowing it to be an equal voice amid a band of\nvirtuoso improvisers. Its slightly coarse texture adds sinew to the implicit\nelegance and stately ease of Eriksson's lines, and so this time-bending, mind-\nbending project makes music that sounds modern and hundreds of years old\nsimultaneously. Eriksson's carefully chosen, go-anywhere colleagues are\nsinger/violinist Susie Bishop, pianist Matt McMahon, saxophonist Matt Keegan,\nbassist Siebe Pogson and drummer Finn Ryan.\n\n **Satsuki Odamura Koto Ensemble, Bankstown Arts Centre, October 27**\n\nThis is part of a brilliant new initiative to take creative music out of its\ninner-city bastions and into the suburbs \u2013 specifically Bankstown, with a\nconcert series on the last Sunday of each month. Satsuki Odamura's ensemble of\nkotos looks spectacular, with the ancient Japanese instruments ranging in size\nfrom five strings to the conventional 13 strings and on to the giant 17-string\nbass model. Odamura being Australia's foremost practitioner, this is the ideal\nway to discover a remarkable instrument that, played with beautifully balletic\nmotion, generates a mostly delicate sound akin to harp, while the routine use\nof note-bending amplifies the music's sadness.\n\n **Kim Sander's music book launch, Camelot, October 27**\n\nFor decades he pioneered of the exploration of world music in this country,\nzeroing in on the sounds of the Balkans and Turkey. Kim Sanders was not only a\nmulti-instrumentalist of the highest order, playing an array of exotic devices\n(including the gaida, a Bulgarian bagpipe made from the skin of a goat that\ndid a fair impression of still being alive) in addition to his burly tenor\nsaxophone. He was also a fine composer, and now, six years after his death, a\nbook of his compositions is being launched by an all-star band of old\ncolleagues, including Sandy Evans, James Greening and Llew Kiek.\n\n **Veronica Swift, Foundry 616, November 6 & 8**\n\nShe first recorded an album at the age of nine, first sang at Lincoln Centre\nin the _Women in Jazz_ series when she was 11, and her career has been going\nnorth ever since. Veronica Swift has now performed with the likes of Wynton\nMarsalis and Chris Botti, but more important than this is the fact that you\ncan hear that this music called jazz is in her bones. She sticks close to the\nstandard repertoire, but makes it live afresh with supple phrasing and\ndazzling improvising. On her first visit to Australia she headlines this\nyear's Sydney International Jazz Festival.\n\n", "url": "/entertainment/theatre/spring-to-it-our-critics-pick-the-best-events-of-the-season-20190821-p52jb0.html", "last_update": "2019-09-01T23:27:07Z", "source": "SMH"},

Williams, Forrest**\n\n### Lack of creativity\n\nRoss Fitzgerald (Our overcrowded prisons and recidivist governments, Canberra\nTimes, December 19) correctly identifies lack of government creativity. With\nBritain now desperate to win back its colonies as trading partners for a post-\nBrexit UK surely our governments could negotiate sending Australian prisoners\nto serve their time in the UK working on work for the dole schemes and\ncommunity service projects?\n\n **Dr Peter Smith, Lake Illawarra, NSW**\n\n### Venezuela's positives\n\nOn Friday, December 16, The Canberra Times published an article entitled\n\"Venezuela's deepening crisis is forcing some parents to give children away\"\nwritten by Girish Gupta and Mircely Guanipa, which portrays the Bolivarian\nGovernment in an unfair and excessively negative manner.\n\nRegarding this matter the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in\nAustralia, would like to make the following observations:\n\nThe article refuses to acknowledge a government that even though is going\nthrough economic difficulties has not abandoned the people of Venezuela, but\nto the contrary has stood firmly by them implementing policies to guard,\nprotect, guarantee and keep the interests of every Venezuelan.\n\nVenezuelans have seen their living conditions greatly improved through the\nBolivarian process. The problems in the Venezuelan economy are not due to some\ninherent fault in socialism, but to artificially low oil prices and sabotage\nby forces hostile to the Bolivarian Government.\n\nIt is and has been a constant practice of the revolutionary Venezuelan\ngovernment allocate more than 60 per centof fiscal expenditure to the growth\nof social policies; which meant that, for example, most of the United Nation's\nMillenium Development Goals were not only reached by Venezuela but continue to\nimprove. Through the implementation of Social Missions, extreme poverty was\nreduced from 24 per cent in 1990 to 7.1 per cent in 2012 and the unemployment\nrate reached an all time low of 5.5 per cent in 2014. Venezuela was awarded\nspecial recognition by the United Nations Development Programme due to\nreaching a schooling rate of 93.4 per cent by 2014 and has also eradicated\nilliteracy from its population.\n\nWith the creation of the School Feeding Program there are now 4,352,972\nstudents benefiting from this service, compared to only 119,512 at the\nbeginning of the revolution, which represents an increase of 3542 per cent.\n\nImprovements in free health services, specifically in areas such as maternity\nand neonatal care meant that Venezuela also decreased significantly the infant\nmortality rate.\n\n **Daniel Gasparri-Rey, Minister Counsellor, Charge d'Affaires A.I., Embassy\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in Australia**\n\n### Christmas correctness\n\nLay off Peter Dutton, Nicholas Stuart, (\"Dutton's call to arms against\npolitical correctness shows he's having a happy holiday in fantasy land,\"\nDecember 20, p14) for complaining that political rectitude has changed \"Merry\nChristmas\" to \"Happy Holidays\" at a Queensland school concert.\n\nIt's not only school teachers who are succumbing, retail corporations are also\nsurrendering.\n\nWhen did you last hear supermarket loudspeakers playing carols like Rudolph\nthe red nosed reindeer or I saw mummy kissing Santa Claus eh?\n\n **Bill Deane, Chapman**\n\n### Curb housing bonanza\n\nYou could never satirically \u2014 or even just tragically \u2014 concoct up the reality\nof an Australia where an official federal inquiry into housing affordability\ncan report nothing much needs doing or can be done \u2014 other than cynically\nplace the ball vaguely in the court of supply.\n\nLooking at you, states and territories, you nasty obstacles to progress, land\navailability and total deregulation. Is there a Nobel for disingenuity and\nartfulness?\n\nIt means nothing to this august \"committee\" that we have had such a red hot\nand accelerating profit-driven production of housing for the last 20 years as\nto completely outstrip the trades skill pool available to do a decent job, as\nan ACT analysis a few years ago found and as every new- or near-new-apartment\nbuyer this century will attest?\n\nIs anybody calling the developer-infatuated NSW and ACT governments\ndevelopment-unfriendly?\n\nHousing is already being knocked together too quickly and shoddily as it is,\nso supply cannot be blamed.\n\nRein in the outlandish pyramid scheme supporting today's Australia \u2014 an\nunfettered paying-migration and foreign house-buying Ponzi bonanza? and the\nprevailing canon of getting people richer, quicker in great disproportion to\ntheir wealth. Certainly not!\n\nHave a moment to hear Dick Smith out? Never!\n\n **Alex Mattea, Kingston**\n\n### Before diving into new venture ANU chief should think carefully\n\nANU vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt should be very careful when dealing with\nAndrew Barr over developmental matters (\"ANU dives in the deep end with new\npool\", CT, December 20, p6).\n\nThe latter's involvement in such matters over the years has not always been in\nthe community's best interest, and especially when it involves the Chief\nMinister's idea of building a stadium in place of the city's Olympic pool.\n\nFurthermore, with parking currently being all but impossible on the ANU campus\nhow does the vice-chancellor intend to \"draw in Canberrans from outside of\nANU\". By all means build the pool for the university but do not allow it to be\nused as an excuse for the Chief Minister to abandon our existing Olympic pool.\n\n **Murray Upton, Belconnen**\n\n### Quaint? Not so!\n\nI was saddened to see Kathy Evans, in her article on Nigel Kennedy (Panorama,\nDecember 17, p15), describe Vivaldi's Four Seasons as \"a set of quaint baroque\ntunes\".\n\nIt is one of the masterworks of Western music.\n\nNigel Kennedy is, of course, perfectly free to play it in any way he chooses.\n\nHowever, the likelihood is that before too long, his offerings will be seen as\nquaint historical artefacts whereas, good performances of the Four Seasons in\nthe spirit of the composer's intentions, will seem fresh and vibrant \u2014 as they\nare today.\n\nIn my view, Kathy Evans shows a lack of historical and musical understanding.\n\n **Peter Boal, Evatt**\n\n### Vosikata depraved\n\n'Despicable' was the headline and despicable he was. (\"Despicable\", December\n17, p1).\n\nThe brutal murder and treatment of Daniela D'Addario by Josaia Vosikata was\ndescribed by his defence lawyer as not being in the worst category, a\ndescription seemingly shared by John Burns the Supreme Court judge who passed\nsentence.\n\nPerhaps these two people could explain to the people of Canberra what test\nthey used to come to this conclusion.\n\nI find the heinous acts and premeditation by Vosikata in murdering Daniela and\nthe treatment of her after the act to be at the top of the pile.\n\nA depraved and debauched person who should never be released.\n\n **L. Christie, Canberra**\n\n### Rethink a pet \"gift\"\n\nIf you are thinking of giving a dog or cat as a \"gift\" this Christmas, please\nreconsider.\n\nAnimals require a lot of time, attention, patience and money \u2014 all of which\nare scarce during the holiday season.\n\nWhen their novelty wears off, animals who are given as \"gifts\" are often\nneglected, left in backyards, dumped on the streets to die or surrendered to\nshelters which have to euthanise thousands of animals every year.\n\nAdding a dog or cat to the family means promising to care for this animal for\nhis or her lifetime \u2014 which could be 15 years or more.\n\nIf you're ready for this, please adopt from a shelter.\n\n **Laura Weyman-Jones, PETA Australia, Sydney**\n\n### Airport bus a secret\n\nOne of Canberra's best kept secrets? The location of the ACTION bus stop at\nCanberra Airport.\n\nPity the poor misguided arriving airline passenger who has hopes of travelling\nto Civic by public transport.\n\nThere are many helpful signs pointing them to taxi ranks, Uber pick-up points\nand private bus stops, but not a word about public transport.\n\nOne would think that a government that is committed to spending about a\nbillion dollars on a 12-kilometre tram line would be able to stump up a few\nthousand dollars on signs to help incoming visitors and returning Canberrans\nfind the public bus stop at the airport.\n\nFor those interested, the bus stop is hidden away in Brindabella Circuit, just\npast the big roundabout.\n\n **Keith Pantlin, Downer**\n\n### No place for war plane\n\nA civil aviation airport is an inappropriate place for the display of a\nmilitary aircraft (Letters, December 17).\n\nAs everyone in Australian aviation will tell you ad nauseam, it was the civil\naviation practitioners who conquered Australia's \"tyranny of distance\"\nbeginning with the first flight between capital cities (Sydney-Melbourne,\nNovember 12, 1917. by W.J. Stutt in a US-built WWI training aircraft, the\nCurtiss JN-4B).\n\nThousands of these aircraft were built and, after the war, sold to the\ncivilian market.\n\nA military training aircraft with no weapon systems but used extensively for\ncivil aviation is the plane for Canberra Airport; a plane around which the\nhawks and doves can flutter with nary a ruffled feather.\n\n **Sean A. Allan, Kambah**\n\n### Guiding the way\n\nWhile it was lovely to see photos of the history of the Guides (Take Five,\nCanberra Times, December 16, p39), I was disappointed to see them described as\n\"Girl Scouts\".\n\nThis is used in other countries, but is not the Australian term.\n\nThe role of Guides in a girl or young adult's life is very valuable, but they\nare a separate organisation, a sister to Scouts and should not be confused\nwith them. Your reference to the \"Scout Jamboree\" at Cataract Park in 1988 was\nalso misleading. I attended that camp. It was known as Porepunka (even\n\"Pouring Punka\" given the weather), and was an International Guide Camp, not a\nScout Jamboree.\n\nInterested girls and young women should contact Guides Australia.\n\n **Roanna Gardiner, Isabella Plains**\n\n### Award well deserved\n\nRe Michelle Potter's most interesting Panorama story (\"In step with youth\",\nDecember 17, p14), Canberrans should be most grateful that Ruth Osborne\naccepted the invitation in 1999 to come to Canberra from Perth to set up the\nQuantum Leap Youth Program for the Australian Choreographic Centre at Gorman\nHouse.\n\nPerth's loss was certainly Canberra's gain, as Ruth has made a tremendous\ncontribution to Youth Dance in Canberra and is most deserving of her Churchill\nFellowship.\n\nNot only has she broadened the way young people experience dance, but she has\nadvocated a most worthy activity for youth. All very commendable.\n\n **John Milne, Chapman**\n\n### TO THE POINT\n\n **EARLY HIGH-FLYERS**\n\nWell I'll be blowed. When I was a kid in the 1940s we used to play outside\nwith the neighbourhood kids. Little did I know that we were called traceurs as\nper \"School high flyers\", December 19, p5.\n\n **Ken Wood, Holt**\n\n **THE ART OF WAR**\n\nIn displaying old military planes and war-weapon ads, maybe our airport owners\nare awkwardly demonstrating compliance with their lease (\"defence and related\npurposes\").\n\n **Jack Kershaw, Kambah**\n\nIs Sue Wareham (Letters, December 19) our canary in the mine? I think so, but\nwill the mine managers aka the Australian government, take notice?.\n\n **Iven Spicer, Ngunnawal**\n\n **BLAME GAME**\n\nI haven't yet heard the coalition blame Labor for in-growing toenails, but I'm\nsure it has someone working on it.\n\n **Ian McFarlane, Wallaga Lake, NSW**\n\n **CONFUSED**\n\nCarolyn Doyle (Letters, December 20) left me confused. Did our Prime Minister\nrenew \"his commitment to Australia having one of our own as head of state\" as\nshe claimed or washe speaking about republicanism?\n\n **Gary J. Wilson, Macgregor**\n\n **STARTLED RABBITS**\n\nThe observation of pedestrians' \"startled rabbit\" behaviour would have Ivan\nPavlov salivating, George Kosakos (Letters, December 16). Carillon recitals\nwill be captivating, pedestrians spontaneously leaping in time to the giant\nclavier.\n\n **Matt Ford, Crookwell**\n\n **ARMS RACE**\n\nPeter O'Dea, (Letters, December 20) Australia with guns blazing will always be\nthere. Sabre-rattling Tories expect that. Labor people are more cognisant of\noutcomes, even if the current leadership is not. The US saved us in 1943. Next\ntime round we'll be its surrogate battlefield.\n\n **Barrie Smillie, Duffy**\n\n **CLASSICS SLIP**\n\nWas it Frank O'Shea's intention to illustrate the decline of classical\nknowledge by misquoting \"De mortuis nil nisi bene\" as \"De mortuis nil nisi\nbonum\"?\n\n **Hans Kuhn, Campbell**\n\n **SLIP SLIDING AWAY**\n\nPeter Dutton was shocked to hear of the unauthorised hill rolling by Bolshie\nCanberran ingrates. He said \"In future, I will decide who will roll down the\nPH grass and the circumstances in which they will be permitted to do so\". Roll\nthe Dutt!\n\n **John Mungoven, Stirling**\n\nEmail: .
